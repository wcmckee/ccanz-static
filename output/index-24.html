<h5>BY KATARINA GRAY-SHARPE</h5>
<p>According to Heywood (2000), property is “a social institution, defined by custom, convention and, in most cases, by law” (p. 141). It is “an established and enforceable claim to an object or possession; it is a right not a ‘thing.’” Where enforced by legal apparatus, proprietary rights can be seen as both negative and positive, allowing the claimant to control behaviours associated with tangible and intangible products.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is an entitlement to an “intangible product” of “human mental activity” (<a href="http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199248179.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199248179-e-028?rskey=2XD03d&amp;result=1&amp;q=legalism" target="_blank">Gordon, 2012</a>, ¶ 5-6). The World Intellectual Property Organization (<a href="http://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/" target="_blank">[WIPO]</a>, n.d.b) defines intellectual property broadly as “creations of the mind: inventions; literary and artistic works; and symbols, names and images used in commerce” (p. 2). From this definition, two categories of intellectual property emerge: industrial property (such as trademarks) and copyright.</p>
<p>Copyright is an application of proprietary rights. Products covered by copyright include “(a) literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works: (b) sound recordings: (c) films: (d) communication works: (e) typographical arrangement of published editions” (<a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345921.html" target="_blank">Copyright Act 1994</a>, s14[1]). These rights include control of duplication (or copying), which the author may assign to others (for example, through Creative Commons licensing). In many languages, copyright is termed an “author’s right…. underlin[ing] the fact, recognized in most laws, that the author has certain specific rights in his creation which only he can exercise” (WIPO, n.d.a, p. 4).</p>
<p>Copyright is focused on authorship: “sustaining the conditions of creativity that enable an individual to craft out of thin air an Appalachian Spring, a Sun Also Rises, a Citizen Kane” (Goldstein, 1991, as cited in <a href="http://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/pdf/IPCasebook2014.pdf" target="_blank">Boyle, 2014</a>, p. 275). The writer was conceived in the 1700s “as one mouth among many” (Boyle, 2014, p. 273). However, in response to the Romantic “aristocratic cult of individuality”, craftsmanship was reconstructed as authorship, the source of inspiration moving from beyond to within the individual (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stagble/2708058" target="_blank">Swart, 1962</a>, p. 77). This immanent inspiration finds legal grounds in copyright.</p>
<p>Copyright maintains distinctions between the idea and its authorial expression. Ideas are conceived as being publicly-sourced from the commons, whilst expression is privately-derived from the creative mind. As an example, multiple filmmakers may use the same language, the same colours, and the same musical notes, but create independent, creative works for which they each can claim author’s rights. Thus, originality of expression is used as justification to manage the conflict between the public and private claims to property.</p>
<p>Copyright’s reliance on property and immanent inspiration are problematic for me. In the first instance, property as the claiming of something (belongings) conflicts with the idea of being claimed by something (belonging). I come from a family where we were claimed by the land and its people. My father’s generation will be the first to apply European inheritance customs. This sense of belongingness initiates obligation. My paid and unpaid work emphasises service to community. I still struggle with the conflicting forms of belonging/s. Although I respect the objects of others, it has taken almost 20 years for me to learn to lock the house.</p>
<p>In the second instance, I find extremely peculiar the idea that inspiration emanates from a singular mind. As a songwriter, image-maker, and academic, I do not believe that creativity is privately-derived. Although my creative works are crafted by me, they draw on objects and ideas external to my mind. Lacking a definitive method for attributing these sources does not mean that those sources do not exist. It simply means my work is always provisional. Although copyright alone demands enforceable behaviours, such conditionality engenders its own responsibilities.</p>
<p>Responsibility is related to duty, accountability, and actions of a "sensible, reasonable or morally correct fashion", and has become central to my thinking due to engagements with the theorist Emmanuel Levinas (Heywood, 2000, p. 146). <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/" target="_blank">Bergo (2011)</a> describes “the fundamental intuition of Levinas’s philosophy [as] the non-reciprocal relation of responsibility” (¶ 4). According to Levinas (1989), I am born with responsibility, unequal, and in persecution. As the source of my inspiration, I am “disturbed by the face of the Other” and must prepare myself to answer its call (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227603123_Singular_justice_and_software_piracy?ev=prf_pub" target="_blank">Introna, 2007</a>, p. 271).</p>
<p>I have found two tools that help me in my task. First, I have <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2014/02/04/book-review-the-accidental-species-misunderstandings-of-human-evolution/" target="_blank">published in open formats</a>. There are normative arguments, which claim user rights based on financial sources. However, I utilise open access publishing as one way of meeting my obligation to the muses’ call. Second, I utilise Creative Commons (CC) licensing for my still and moving images. CC licensing is not a remedy for the problem of property and intrinsically-sourced creativity. In fact, it relies on copyright as a foundation. However, it does allow me to be held accountable for my duties through my choice of CC license.</p>
<p>I utilise the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC-ND 4.0</a>) license. This licence asserts three rights. First, the license claims the right to be appropriately credited (BY). In addition to being standard in the Academy, attribution allows me to be held accountable for my creative mistakes. Further, it facilitates connection with users to whom I owe duty of service. Second, the license claims the right to restrict use to non-commercial purposes (NC). By allowing free commercial use of my work, I limit the ability of others for whom provision provides an income. Third, the license claims the right to control distribution of modified versions (ND). I cannot act effectively to rectify the mistakes of others online. More importantly, I must be answerable for and to the creative vision that is external to me. The CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license helps me to achieve that goal.</p>

<p>Kia ora everyone, my name is Elizabeth Heritage and I’m the new Communications Lead here at Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ. Today’s my first day and I’m really excited to get started!</p>
<p>I’m a British Kiwi and have lived in the UK and NZ. I’m a publisher by trade, although I have also been a policy advisor, intellectual property officer and librarian. I have a keen interest in practical copyright from both consumer and commercial points of view, and am really looking forward to getting stuck in to the creative commons landscape here in Aotearoa. As a publisher, I’m particularly interested in the ways creative commons can be applied to books, especially ebooks, so do get in touch if you have thoughts or experiences to share on that front.</p>
<p>I’ll be at CCANZ here in Wellington two days a week - you can contact me on <a href="mailto:elizabeth@creativecommons.org.nz">elizabeth@creativecommons.org.nz</a>. When I’m not here, I’m probably either reading (my lifelong passion) or out and about helping make books happen, working freelance with publishers and authors.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to meeting the creative commons community and getting to know you and what you’re up to, so please do drop me a line to introduce yourself.</p>
<p>Ngā mihi nui, na Elizabeth</p>

<h5>BY BILL ANDERSON</h5>
<p>Three years ago I was in a university book store in the US. For the first time ever, I saw that students could lease electronic copies of a text book for a semester. At about half the cost of the hardcopy text it was probably a bargain given that the second-hand (hard)copies I saw were going for around two-thirds of the full price. I've since also discovered that students in the US, who pay on average around $US650-700 annually for text books, can lease hardcopy books as well.</p>
<p>In Aotearoa/New Zealand, as in the US, textbooks cost a lot. <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/nz-needs-open-education/" target="_blank">Victoria Rea's post</a> highlights this point. I'm not sure what has happened in Australia and NZ, but in the US, textbook prices have risen by over 800% since 1978 – in comparison with <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/01/why-are-college-textbooks-so-absurdly-expensive/266801/" target="_blank">a CPI increase of around 250%</a>. It is no surprise that with such an increase, US students are seeking and using alternatives such as leasing, or that Victoria suggested that Open Educational Resources (OER) are a step towards solving the problem.</p>
<p>There are, indeed, alternatives to leasing textbooks that take advantage of the large number of open educational resources, typically Creative Commons licensed, available online. Such alternatives come in many forms.</p>
<p>Some lecturers, familiar with and committed to OER use, suggest individual resources that together might substitute for texts. Organisations have attempted to use OERs as the basis for texts. One such is boundless.com, which gathers and organises OER material in ways similar to textbooks. Flat World Knowledge also attempted to bring free and open access textbooks to students. Both have struggled to create business models that incorporate OERs, add value for students, stay low cost and remain profitable.</p>
<p>Publishing companies stand to lose the most as high quality OERs become increasingly available. They are doing what you'd expect – fighting the trend, as they did in the case of boundless.com, or adapting to it. In the latter case, Pearson offer a service that allows lecturers to create course materials using their own content, Pearson's resources, and OERs. The bottom line here is that CC-licensed OERs are having an impact on the way the textbook game is being played. It may take a while, but change is definitely coming.</p>
<p>While textbooks for students are one issue, another is the publication of texts by academics for an academic readership. The issue here is different. All academic authors want their work to be read – by as large an audience as possible. How to make this happen? A colleague of mine, Terry Anderson of Athabasca University in Canada has found at least one answer – and it is an answer I see echoed in a post on this website.</p>
<p>Terry is a highly respected academic and author in the e-learning and distance education field. He has written several books, publishing his first two under 'normal' copyright licensing provisions. They were successful, selling around 1000 and 1200 respectively.</p>
<p>Terry's most recent book is available openly from the publishers under a CC licence (CC BY-NC-ND 2.5 CA). Terry tells me that downloads of whole copies as well as individual chapters have amounted to over 180,000. What's more interesting is that the publisher has also reported sales of hardcopy books have amounted to over 2200 copies. Terry feels that open publication has both increased readership and increased sales (as it did for Richard White's music – see <a title="Richard White" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/richard-white/" target="_blank">Hannah Mettner's post about Richard White</a>).</p>
<p>Like the music industry before it, the world of books is changing. Certainly, in the academic world the Creative Commons licensing of texts and the use of existing OERs is creating a publication environment unlike any we have seen before.</p>

CC BY</p>
<p>Every family has its story.</p>
<p>As we commemorate <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/">100 years of the beginning of World War 1</a>, a lot of us are tracking down our grandparents stories, how the soldiers within in our families fought and died, how those back at home coped with the hardships and the many years of repercussions as the scars, both external and internal, came home.</p>
<p>Together with these <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/life-100-years-ago">‘big event’ stories</a>, we all have a myriad of everyday tales that we commonly think of as particular to ourselves, memories of days gone past and yarns to be recounted at family get-togethers. And of course we all have our recent stories: last year’s summer holiday, the kid’s birthday celebration and even that catch up with mates in the pub last week.</p>
<p>All of these stories go to make up the fabric of our families, our friendships and our whanau - without them we are indeed islands and, as we all know, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man_Is_an_Island_(disambiguation)">No man is an island</a>”.</p>
<p>So what does Creative Commons licences have to do with this collection of stories spanning the generations in your family?</p>
<p>Outside of verbal histories (or in some cases myths and even our own family urban legends) we gain insight into our earliest stories from the <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Topic/7425">writings</a>, <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Object/1436499">photographs</a> and, if we’re lucky, film left behind by our ancestors. As time passes on, these artefacts enter the “<a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/pdm">public domain</a>" (also know as “no known copyright”) and come to possess, as we see in the <a href="https://twitter.com/LTCOLMalone">personal histories and stories</a> being used in the World War 1 commemorations across the Internet, a sense of common / shared knowledge.</p>
<p>Hearing Gran recall her childhood stories, during those fleeting times that she wants to tell us and we are old enough to listen, are special moments. But when we touch, see and hear from the artefacts of her days -- such as her father’s <a href="https://twitter.com/adkin_diary">diaries scribbled during the battles</a> -- we are immediately connected in a far more visceral manner. We feel it as part of our own story.</p>
<p>Taking a step sideways for second, we are all keenly aware, especially in times of emergency and hardship, that families that play together stay together. These communities of families are the coming together of stories shared across the whanau boundary as they build, one upon the other,  flowing across and through to make the very fabric of our society.</p>
<p>As stories are shared, the artefacts (diaries, cine film, video tapes, clothes, tapes) become the ‘facts’ upon which we all stand. Locking up these artifacts with individuals and inside families could slowly diminish our sense of society, community and shared being.</p>
<p>However, letting Gran’s artefacts go to the vagaries of the ‘marketplace’ is not something many of us feel comfortable with - these are OUR stories and we want them to be treasured and loved as much as we do.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/">Creative Commons licences</a> allows us to think into the future, to place our own wishes upon our photos, to let future generations know how we’d like our stories to be shared.</p>
<p>Some may indeed want to reserve all rights and keep the diaries away from the commercial world. Others may want the great great grandchildren to know that the re-use of the 1970’s holiday film would be welcome as long as it wasn’t for monetary gain (that’s a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/">BY-NC</a> licence).  In fact, most of use will choose different approaches for different artefacts - the diary is for certain eyes and not to be shared, the photos of beaches are for all to use however they want and in whatever manner and tools people have in the future.</p>
<p>Creative Commons licences allows all of us, including your Gran, to make a conscious and active choice - this is how our stories can be reused. And for your great grandchildren, or even your cousins third nephew twice removed, this allows them the freedom to take those memories and incorporate them into their own stories, creating a richer a deeper society for all.</p>

<h5>BY VICTORIA REA</h5>
<p>Access to education is a fundamental human right, as enshrined in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Throughout the world there is a disparity to access of not only education but also high quality educational resources. Open Education is a viable solution to widening access to quality education for all students worldwide.</p>

<h5>What is Open Education?</h5>

<p>Open Education is based on the simple idea that knowledge is powerful and a public good, and that it is in the best interests of society to increase access to education and educational resources in order to produce a well informed and educated citizenry.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, more and more educators and educational institutions have started to open their resources under open licences, so that these resources can be freely (and legally) accessed, shared and adapted. Open Education provides everyone access to learning materials, most of all those non-traditional groups of students that aren’t engaged in the formal education system.</p>
<h5>Why is it Important in Tertiary Education?</h5>

<p>Given the changes in technology over the last decade,most universities and other tertiary education institutions have been relatively slow to recognise the potential of open educational resources. Higher educational institutions have been using the internet and other digital technologies for several years. Yet, until recently, most learning materials were locked up behind passwords in closed systems that were unreachable for outsiders. Open Education aims to break down such barriers and encourage and enable the free sharing of content.</p>
<p>Universities are constantly trying to improve their teaching practices by making their processes more engaging and motivating and Open Education Resources are a good method to address some of the problems that tertiary students currently face.</p>
<p>Here are five broader arguments on why higher education institutions should develop open education resources:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sharing of knowledge is a good thing, in line with human rights and generally speaking beneficial for society, especially those with little access to formal higher education;</li>

    <li>Resources developed by publicly funded institutions should be able to be freely shared and reused by the public;</li>

    <li>Sharing and reusing content reduces the costs of development i, thereby increasing efficiency;</li>

    <li>Open education resources presents a more positive and accessible view of education and can attract new students;</li>

    <li>Open practices can increase the quality and innovation of resources, as less time has to be spent on information that has already been collated by someone else.</li>

</ol>
<h5>The Cost of Education</h5>

<p>The cost of education, and especially higher education, is ever increasing. When enrolling in university, you not only already face the $600- $800 dollars to enroll in one paper for one semester; you also face the sometimes exorbitant prices for some textbooks and resources. Students often have to turn to outdated editions of textbooks -- or even opt not to buy them due to their unaffordability.</p>
<p>When you pay $100 for the latest edition of an 'essential' textbook (which the lecturer is the author of), and also use it twice in a semester, it is easy to see why many are calling for open educational resources. Also, due to the increasing spread by which knowledge and information is produced and disseminated throughout the globe, textbooks can become less relevant days after they are printed when new information comes to light. There is a strong need for up to date and accurate information especially in tertiary education.</p>
<p>Open Education Resources are a way to mitigate this problem. The price of educational content doesn’t need to be as expensive as it currently is. Through sharing this content online, we can add to the pool of information which students all around the world can have access to with little to no financial hindrance.</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>Education is an integral part of society and participation in higher education is increasingly in demand throughout the world. Despite the large number of people engaged in education there are still barriers to education such as the cost of resources. The idea of Open Educational Resources has the ability to mitigate some of the barriers facing people trying to enter the tertiary education sector.</p>

<h5>BY CAMERON MCLEAN</h5>
<p>By now, most of us know that openness in research is critical. We know the importance of ensuring that primary research objects, such as data, publications, methods, code and review, are made openly and transparently available, with the right to reuse or re-purpose.  What is sometimes left out of these discussions is the importance of a broader realm of works and media that researchers often use in their practice, specifically  visual representations.</p>
<p>Humans are visual creatures - as Aristotle professes, "the soul never thinks without an image". Should the reader be in doubt of a such a claim, <a href="http://neomam.com/interactive/13reasons/" target="_blank">this excellent infographic</a>, which explains why we like infographics, may be persuasive.</p>
<p>In science and academic research, we routinely construct and use visual representations. Graphics and images express difficult concepts in cognitively optimal ways, and they give us insights into data in ways that words or arbitrary symbols cannot. We all benefit from representations that help us communicate, explore, clarify, or critique our ideas.</p>
<p>Sometimes our visual objects <em>are</em> the actual data themselves, or they may be the end result of a long scientific analysis. At other times, graphics in the form of visual narratives are consciously designed to support the communication of complex or highly abstract concepts, or to facilitate some aspect of a workflow. While the art and science of effective visual communication is a field unto itself, the end products, and the various tools and component elements that we use to create such representations, are valuable and reusable resources.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/640px-Haeckel_Anthomedusae.jpg"><img class="wp-image-327" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/640px-Haeckel_Anthomedusae.jpg" alt="Reference: Ernst Haeckel - Kunstformen der Natur (1904), plate 46: Anthomedusae.

Creative Commons Public Domain Mark 1.0 (via Wikimedia Commons)</p>
<p>In addition to analysis and data visualisation, where visual representations constitute a core part of the research workflow, we use graphics for all sorts of reasons -- including presentations, slides, posters, conceptual diagrams, websites, and animations. These artifacts may be used to communicate with our peers, as educational materials, in public engagement efforts; they might be co-opted as organisational branding, or supplied to the media for journalistic pieces.</p>
<p>While academia is granted certain freedoms with the use of copyrighted materials, these legal exceptions do not allow us to reuse visual works as broadly as we need to; this is why we need scientific graphics that use open and permissive licenses.</p>
<p>Let's consciously use open principles and make it easier to create, find, share, reuse, and adapt our graphics for science. Having more options available may not necessarily make one a better designer, but it can only help to have better materials from which we can create clear depictions of complex ideas.</p>
<p>So, readers, what openly licensed tools or resources do you use to present or communicate science visually? Add your suggestions or thoughts in the comments and let's pool our graphical riches.</p>

<h5>BY TIM MCNAMARA</h5>
<p>This post is a compilation of reflections I've had participating in a number of hack days and similar events over the last year.</p>
<p>My experience of these types events has been fostered over a number of years tinkering with and helping out with open source communities. In particular, I have fond memories helping out as a volunteer tester and developer with the <a href="http://one.laptop.org/" target="_blank">One Laptop Per Child</a> programme, and its subsequent software offshoot Sugar Labs.</p>
<p>To me, the terms unconference and hackday imply informality, mutual respect, community development and shared values. Throw a little bit of frugality in there too.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/504706683_53df830eef_z.jpg"><img class="wp-image-318 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/504706683_53df830eef_z.jpg" alt='Reference: "Unconference Schedule" by Jill.

<h5>Tips for Everybody</h5>

<p><em>Know your goals</em>. If you are planning on putting on an event, take the time to think about who you are trying to bring together and why. A hackfest is going to bring technical folk. Talk to technical folk about the kinds of things that will be handy, useful and attractive at the event.</p>
<p><em>Talk to people</em>. There are a number of people within New Zealand. One of the best agencies at this is the National Library of New Zealand. The culture and heritage sector's <a href="http://www.ndf.org.nz/" target="_blank">National Digital Forum</a> and its unconference segment are world-class.</p>
<p><em>Invite media</em> - as well as unconventional media - to get involved. Many teams would love to have their work profiled. But don’t talk to project teams for too long. Geeks need flow.</p>
<p><em>Use social media tactfully</em>. You will get better engagement from technical communities by investing in well-written blogs post than tweets. A small number of people will tweet your event heavily anyway.</p>
<p><em>Break out space</em>. Have a few quiet meeting spaces available to be booked in fifteen minute increments. That will provide an outlet to people who are pretty chatty while balancing the need for quiet.</p>

<h5>HackAKL</h5>

<p><a href="http://hackakl.org.nz/" target="_blank">HackAKL</a>, which took place on 24-25 May and positioned itself as 'Auckland's first civic hacking event', was well run, well catered, well financed and well publicised. It was also one of the most disappointing events I've been involved with. The focus on competition and the lavish spending really began to upset me by the second day.</p>
<p>I loved the free coffee and scoffed my way through plenty of free food, but I kept thinking of the extra bus or two that could have been paid for by forgoing the consultant and marketing fees that would have gone into the event to make it happen.</p>
<p>The counter-argument to my position is likely to run something like, “It was a key event, it needed to be managed professionally”. HackAKL became the centrepiece of a new technology roll-out that included a brand-new API. Hundreds of people signed up to participate. And the stakes were high. And that is why I think that it might have been more sensible for the council to have run multiple small events, rather than one big one.</p>
<p>The technology roll-out did not run smoothly. The new API did not get released on time. The dummy data provided was inconsistent with the documentation. A number of good ideas could not get off the ground.</p>
<p>HackAKL included several invited speakers - including international keynotes via video conference - who were ignored by almost all of the delegates. This made me think that there was too much pushed into it.</p>
<p>One of the things that went relatively well though was the creation of stories and teams beforehand in the wiki. However, as many of the teams were participating as part of corporate groups, there wasn’t a large degree of information-sharing between groups before hand (at least from my limited vantage point).</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6108763356_37c97a1c62_z.jpg"><img class="wp-image-319" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6108763356_37c97a1c62_z.jpg" alt="Reference: 'Auckland from the Sky Tower' by Antonio Colosimo.

Copyright: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives licence</a></p>
<p>Connecting people could have been a much stronger aim for the event. There are a few examples where facilitating network building could have been improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mailing list was not approachable. I subscribed early and a person’s name never appeared in any of the emails. The event organisers were intentionally being anonymous.</li>

    <li>If a council or government department is running an open data event; they should include members of the local open data community. New Zealand has an active group of public servants, hackers and industry members already - but that group didn’t receive official notification of the event.</li>

    <li>The competition element really killed cooperation and communication between teams during the event</li>

</ul>
<p>Overall, I wonder if a smaller event - or perhaps a series of much smaller events - would have felt more Kiwi. As the weekend progressed, I kept thinking of the massive posters, gorgeous website and thinking 'this spend isn't doing much for the people of Mangere who just want a cheaper bus fare'.</p>
<h5>Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint</h5>

<p>Last month, one of the Mozilla Foundation’s newest initiatives, the Science Lab, <a href="http://mozillascience.org/the-mozsprint-heard-round-the-world/" target="_blank">held its first global sprint</a>. The sprint involved two working days of activity in about 30 sites worldwide. Cities were hooked together via video conference. Project leaders handed projects over between cities. As you slept, people kept extending the work that you began.</p>
<p>The budget for this event was tiny. Venues were donated. Marketing material was produced on free and open source software.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, space was donated by two New Zealand companies - Catalyst IT in Auckland, and Dragonfly Data Science in Wellington. My time (which I used to help organise the Auckland site) was donated to the cause by my employer, the <a href="https://www.nesi.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand eScience Infrastructure</a>.</p>
<p>Although the scale was similar to HackAKL, several hundred participants over two days, participating in the sprint felt much more intimate and welcoming. At HackAKL, every team felt very isolated. Within the sprint, teams could work independently but they could also share.</p>
<p>Digital collaboration tools were extremely beneficial. Both video conferencing and IRC played vital and complementary roles.</p>
<p>Every time I joined the video conference, I was warmly welcomed by Alison Stringer in Wellington, Damien Irving in Melbourne and Kaitlin Thaney in New York. We were a small team in Auckland, but felt very much invited to participate in the worldwide project.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Mozilla-Science-Lab-Global-Sprint-by-Tim-McNamara__1407801722_116.90.132.105.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-321" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Mozilla-Science-Lab-Global-Sprint-by-Tim-McNamara__1407801722_116.90.132.105.jpg" alt="Reference: Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint by Tim McNamara.

<h5>ThatCAMP</h5>

<p>Coming back to home, the digital humanities community hold a lovely event annually called <a href="http://wellington2013.thatcamp.org/about/" target="_blank">THATcamp.</a> THATcamp - The Humanities And Technology camp - is where humanities students and scholars come together to explore how tech can assist them in their practice.</p>
<p>Digital humanists use computational tools such as natural language processing to conduct (meta)analyses of corpora. (Excuse the jargon!) These days, humanities scholars use computers to read lots of things and try to detect patterns that are impossible for humans to detect by themselves.</p>
<p>For THATcamp, there is no large pool of public funding for the event. There are a no large banners. Instead, there might be a website administered by someone in their spare time, a mailing list and a passion for collaboration. During the day-long event, people pick the schedule that they are interested in. And they talk. And they learn. And they might build.</p>
<p>Outcomes could be new partnerships, an understanding of issues faced by other projects, strengthening of relationships and building mutual respect with players such as a university’s IT support staff.</p>
<h5>Wrapping Up</h5>

<p>One of the things I've noticed is that there has been a strong tend towards corporatisation of the ‘unconference’. It’s cool to ‘hack’.</p>
<p>There once were unconferences, now there are hackday startups. Code for America is being spun out around the globe and I feel that Auckland suffered because of the insistence to follow a cookie cutter format. I understand the motivations - a Chief Executive is far more likely to want to sign off on an event that has a defined structure and is well-rehearsed.</p>
<p>However, building a competition drives teams away from each other and doesn’t enable two other key goals -  creative exploration and collaboration.</p>

<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The Launch of WW100</h5>

<p>Earlier this week, New Zealand officially <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/the-week-we-went-to-war" target="_blank">commemorated the outbreak of World War One</a> with, fittingly enough, both a 100-gun salute and a field of 100 white crosses on the Parliamentary lawn. The centenary is, rightfully, a big deal, and will be for the next four years. As the Ministry for Culture and Heritage's <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/" target="_blank">lovely WW100 site</a> points out, the events of 1914-1918 “touched nearly every New Zealand family, every community, school, workplace and club or group” in the country.</p>
<p>As you might expect, much of the New Zealand GLAM sector – that's Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums – has been busily working on ways to mark the centenary, both for its own sake, but also to draw attention to the depth and quality of our local heritage collections. The hub for these efforts is the aforementioned WW100 site, which provides a range of resources, including a nice new search filter for WW1 materials. The WW100 folks will also be organising events, activities and projects all over the country for the next four years.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H526.jpg"><img class="wp-image-312" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H526.jpg" alt="Moses, the donkey mascot of the New Zealand Army Service Company.

<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Opening the 'H' Series</h5>

<p>Part of the promise of the centenary is, of course, to help teach New Zealanders about the events that -- as many speeches and essays over the next four years will undoubtedly point out -- shaped them as a nation. To put this another way, the centenary promises to help remind New Zealanders that this is <em>their</em> history: regardless of whether one had family members in the war -- or even had family members in New Zealand -- the war shaped the kind of place that New Zealand became.</p>
<p>And if the events are part of New Zealand's common heritage, then so too are many of the works from that era. Recognising this, some of the largest organisations in the local GLAM sector have been working to ensure that the most significant heritage items from the war are made openly available to everyone, free of all technical, price and legal restrictions.</p>
<p>A particularly interesting example of this  is the efforts of the Alexander Turnbull Library – working in tandem with organisations across the culture and heritage sector – to release the 'H' series of WW1 photographs.</p>
<p>The H series are photographs taken by Henry Armytage Sanders, and they are, as Melanie Lovell-Smith points out in a detailed background piece, “the most comprehensive visual record of New Zealanders on the Western front from 1917 to 1918.” As Lovell-Smith points out, before 1917, New Zealand didn't have an official photographer – due to the expense -- which means that the only photographs before that date were those taken by the New Zealand troops themselves.</p>
<p><a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/photographing-new-zealanders-at-war" target="_blank">The piece goes into much more fascinating detail</a> about both Sanders and the H Series itself, including the circuitous route of the negatives – via the RSA – to the Alexander Turnbull Library.</p>
<p>The latest chapter in this long archival story is that the ATL has released digital reproductions of these photographs, in high resolution, with clear 'no known copyright' statements. This means that anyone, anywhere, can view, share, download and reuse the official record of New Zealand in World War One, without asking permission or paying a fee.</p>
<p>This follows the passage of the <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/about-us/strategy-and-policy/collection-use-and-reuse-policy" target="_blank">National Library of New Zealand's Use and Reuse policy</a> (mentioned by Richard earlier in the week), principle five of which asserts that “Where no copyright restriction applies, NLNZ will seek to provide the items for use and reuse with a statement of ‘no known copyright restrictions’, after careful consideration of cultural and ethical issues relating to the items.”</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/find-WW1-content" target="_blank">find the photographs through the WW100 website</a>, and download them <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/photos?text=%22H+series+negatives%22" target="_blank">free of charge (and copyright restrictions) from the National Library’s website</a>.</p>

<h5 style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Opening more NZ GLAMs</h5>

<p>While the release of the H Series is very exciting, it is just the latest in a run of Open GLAM developments. Beyond the publication of the National Library's open policy, <a href="http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2014/06/03/free-downloadable-images-from-te-papas-collections/">Te Papa has also released</a> over 30,000 open images under high resolution. 14,000 of these are made available under a Creative Commons BY-NC-ND licence; 17,000 have been released without any copyright restrictions whatsoever. This release by Te Papa has been several years in the making, as <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/te-papa-joins-commons/" target="_blank">our case study</a>, written in 2012, makes clear.</p>
<p>These content releases and open policies will surely be the first of many. There are hundreds of heritage institutions in New Zealand, with many millions of high quality works. As these works are digitised -- as they have been for the last fifteen or so years -- it's important that they are released as free of price, technical and legal restrictions as possible, so that as many New Zealanders (and non-New Zealanders) as possible can access and engage with works from their own heritage.</p>
<p>As was noted in some of the preliminary discussions behind the release of the H Series, New Zealand's culture and heritage sector does not have clear, standardised rights statements, and sometimes imposes additional price, legal or technical restrictions on the reuse of heritage works. Heritage institutions will need to adopt clear policies and processes to be, as Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager of DigitalNZ and the kiwi representative on the <a href="http://openglam.org/working-group/" target="_blank">Open GLAM Working Group</a>, <a href="http://openglam.org/2014/02/19/openglam-progress-and-potential-in-aotearoa-new-zealand/" target="_blank">puts it</a>, "clear, consistent, and open with our cultural collections."</p>
<p>Over the next few month, and leading up to the National Digital Forum in November, we at Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ will be doing our best to help out, mostly by producing standard resources for an Open GLAM toolkit. There are, happily, a heap of support for these policies from the sector itself.</p>
<p>In advance of that, though -- and to give you a sense of what is happening in New Zealand -- you might want to check out this detailed case study of the <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/how-the-rijksmuseum-opened-up-its-collection-a-case-study" target="_blank">Rijksmuseum,</a> one of the world's leading open heritage institutions. While you're at it, you can also check out our (smaller) case study of <a title="RECOLLECT: Upper Hutt City Library" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/recollect-upper-hutt-city-library/" target="_blank">Upper Hutt City Library, </a>to show you what's already being done.</p>
