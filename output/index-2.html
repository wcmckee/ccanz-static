<p>The New Zealand government has taken positive steps toward open access licensing this winter as the 'NZGOAL framework' has been aproved by Cabinet. Part of the framework's purpose is to provide guidance on licensing of government copyright works for re-use using Creative Commons licences.</p>
<p>The release of NZGOAL was announced by the Minister of State Services late last week. <a href="http://www.e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal" target="_blank">The framework</a> (itself <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">CC BY 3.0 NZ</a>) and additional materials are <a href="http://www.e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal" target="_blank">available here</a> with a press release on the E-government website.</p>

<h4>A message from CC International...</h4>

<p>As a supporter of Creative Commons, you recognise the importance of what we do to make knowledge easily, freely, and legally available to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>We are excited to announce the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/catalyst" target="_blank">Catalyst Grants program</a></strong>, through which we will be awarding grants of $1000 to $10,000 to researchers, educators and technologists around the world. Grant recipients will be selected through a rigorous public review and transparent evaluation process involving representatives from CC’s affiliate institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Catalyst Grants will make it possible for individuals and organisations to harness the power of Creative Commons</strong>. A grant might enable a group in a developing country to research how Open Educational Resources can positively impact its community. Another could pay for a programmer to add CC licence support to tools for publishing and distributing news. A third could fund a study of entrepreneurs using Creative Commons licences to create a new class of socially responsible businesses.</p>
<p><strong>But we can’t do it <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate" target="_blank">without your help</a></strong>. Our goal is to raise $100,000 from CC supporters like you to fund the Catalyst Grants. Please <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate" target="_blank">donate today</a> to help spread our mission of openness and innovation across cultural and national boundaries.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Joi Ito</p>
<p>CEO, Creative Commons</p>

<h5>From Jessica at Creative Commons Australia:</h5>

<p>This week marks the fifth birthday of ccAustralia's fabulous animated mascots, Mayer and Bettle. So we thought it was a good time to give them a bit of love.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're all fans, but for those new to CC, Mayer and Bettle are the stars of a <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/mayerandbettle" target="_self">5 minute animation</a>, first commissioned for the <a href="http://www.train.qut.edu.au/" target="_self">QUT Smart Train</a> back in 2005 to provide a simple and friendly introduction to CC. Created jointly by local animation team <a href="http://blackbrow.com/" target="_self">Blackbrow</a> (aka Pete Foley and Chris Perren) and our own Elliott Bledsoe, the film has the little blue guys travel through land, sea and space while discussing what Creative Commons is and how it works. In 2008 Mayer and Bettle returned in glorious 3D in a <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/mayerandbettle2" target="_self">sequel</a>, joining Bettle's biggest fan, Flik, in a through the looking glass CC world to talk about how to apply the CC licences to your material.</p>
<p>They grow up so fast. Over the last five years the exuberant Bettle and the long suffering Mayer have been viewed more than 20,000 times (and that's on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3aZoe5VK-c" target="_self">Youtube</a> and <a href="http://www.revver.com/video/94724/cc-mayer-and-bettle-animation/" target="_self">Revver</a> alone). Not bad for a couple of cut outs talking about a copyright licensing system. And thanks to their CC licences, the videos have also been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg4Y09DfAvU" target="_self">subtitled</a>, translated into <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu4tK1ELklo" target="_self">French</a> [update - and <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cc_mayer_bettle_pl.ogv" target="_self">Polish!</a>] and <a href="http://creativecommons.org.tw/blog/archives/000059.html" target="_self">dubbed into Taiwanese.</a> Not to mentioned shown in innumerable workshops, lectures, classrooms, conferences, festivals and even a <a href="http://pechakuchaboston.org/blog/" target="_self">pecha kucha</a>, by CC family and friends.</p>
<p>So we tip our hats to the little duo (and now trio) and encourage you to revisit them every once in a while. And it's never too late for more translations, mashups and remixes. May they continue to educate and inform people about more flexible copyright options well into the next decade.</p>

<blockquote> The early Flying Nun music videos were as raw and uncompromising as the songs they accompanied. Think Len Lye and Don van Vliet, not David Fincher nor Bruce Weber. Many were made with next to no budget. This selection by Shepherd himself documents a taster menu from a great wee record label's cellars. (Hansen)</blockquote>

<p><strong>Tell us a bit about what you do.</strong> I'm an independent musician making synthesizer dance/pop music with a fun, referential edge. I 'grew up' as a musician in the late 90s via the Internet - by finding out about new music, getting involved in free audio software and educating myself musically and technically through articles and forums. Playing live - I've done over a dozen tours, taking in New Zealand, Australia, USA and central/eastern Europe.</p>
<p>My attraction to Creative Commons definitely stems from my early releasing of CD-Rs on New Zealand punk zine distros, and the ethos of the punk/hardcore movement from my teens.</p>
<p><strong>How important is the concept of 'remix' to your work?</strong> While there is a lot of things to be learned from the open intellectual property movement, I think that a lot of the community are falsely holding up remixing as a way of <em>increasing quality. </em>The idea of open source works very, very well for software, but I believe the 'killer app' for Creative Commons is still to come. There are new and exciting implications of the freedoms Creative Commons proposes that we probably haven't even begun to think about. Music today still very much exists in the old, record-industry paradigm, but I believe this is slowly eroding - which leads us to think 'what concept of intellectual property is the child of 2010 going to have in their twenties'?</p>
<p>One specific thing I do believe Creative Commons is good for is as a vehicle to allow freedom of sampling, which is indispensable for electronic musicians. While my work is mostly synthesizer-based I believe I have a responsibility to allow my peers to sample my work - I'd feel guilty if I wasn't 'putting something in the pot' so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>What motivated you to select a Creative Commons</strong><strong> Attribution-Noncommercial-</strong><strong>Share Alike in particular?</strong> While I believe in the freedom of derivative works that Creative Commons provides is totally awesome, I do believe that Attribution needs to be given to the artists involved. I think that my belief in 'my music being good' dictates a noncommercial license for derivatives. If I was making a work that was really based around someone's previous work, it does seem unfair to then go and make money off of it without paying my dues, and Noncommercial has the ability to negotiate this. With Share Alike I'm able to dictate what I deem is the 'best fit' way for people to acquire works.</p>
<p><strong>In what ways could you imagine others reusing and remixing your work?</strong> I'd love to hear my stuff sampled in a hip-hop track - of course I love it myself, but the stuff I do as Disasteradio is just about the 'opposite of hip-hop'. I'd also love to see someone do a generative beat-slicing project out of Creative Commons stuff, like a cool sampler program that would make new tunes automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Have you drawn on other people's creations in your own material? </strong>Aside from a couple of remixes I've done as part of competitions, I don't do much sampling or remixing regularly. What I do draw on is a huge amount of influence from the history of music, video games and films. I'm such a sucker for pastiche and the obscure reference. No artist ever works in a vacuum, and I think there needs to be a way for the more concrete influences to be protected from absurd copyright - Creative Commons is perfect for that.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any New Zealand or international artists and performers who</strong><strong> have influenced your support for the free culture movement? </strong>I do really admire the work of Negativland and Girl talk - and also I think what Rick Prelinger set up with the ephemeral archives on <a href="http://archive.org/" target="_blank">archive.org</a> is a real Internet and public domain treasure.</p>
<p><strong>Future plans/shows coming up?</strong> I'm on a big break from live shows until I put out my 8th album in mid-2010 and then doing some more touring around the world!</p>
