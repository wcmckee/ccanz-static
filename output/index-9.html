             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2012-11-15T14:16:53+13:00">2012-11-15 14:16</time>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Upper Hutt City Library launched <a href="http://uhcl.recollect.co.nz/" target="_blank">RECOLLECT</a>, an online repository of materials from its community archive. The announcement made<a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/upper-hutt-leader/7825164/Upper-Hutt-heritage-database-makes-history" target="_blank"> the front page of the Upper Hutt Leader</a>, where it was celebrated as “a New Zealand first.”</p>
<p>The RECOLLECT platform allows users to browse and discuss archival materials. At present, the site has over 15, 000 photos and hundreds of other items freely available to access and download.</p>
<p>What was not mentioned in the Leader story, however, was perhaps Recollect’s most remarkable feature: nearly all its heritage items—old and new—are made available under a Creative Commons Attribution or Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence.</p>
<p>The Upper Hutt Community Archive was created in 1996, to host heritage materials from the local community. Fourteen year on, the Archive has grown into a rich resource for local residents, and includes thousands of photos, newspapers, oral histories and maps.</p>
<p>[slideshow_deploy id=3033]</p>
<p>Until recently, most of these archival items were largely unknown. Members of the public would have to request copies of heritage materials, and would be charged an administrative fee by the UHCL. As UHCL Archivist Reid Perkins points out, this took up valuable staff time and tended to “put people off using the images.”</p>
<p>RECOLLECT allows user to download images from UHCL’s rich archive of local heritage items. As Reid points out, “this has been a popular feature. People like the fact that they have easy access to these images, which of course if we were using a traditional All Rights Reserved copyright model we wouldn’t be able to do.”</p>
<p>Reid came to the RECOLLECT project in May 2012, and says he was “very impressed” with the library’s attitude towards sharing and reuse. “A lot of institutions are quite risk averse. I was very pleased to come here and see that they didn’t seem to have that attitude.”</p>
<p>In partnership with <a href="http://www.micrographics.co.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Micrographic Services Ltd</a>., library staff agreed that the Creative Commons licences fit with the general ethos of the archive. Their remarkable range of openly licensed resources includes collections of The Upper Hutt Leader itself.</p>
<p>Reid admits that the question of rights has given him some nervous nights, but that most people seem to be willing to allow the public to access and share their local heritage. “There does seem to be a good, positive attitude here.”</p>
<p>The main feeling seems to be that people are proud of their local history and want it better known. They want people to access their images.”</p>
<p>Reid points to the collection of photos by <a href="http://www.upperhuttcity.com/page/1079/JacksonWilfredRevelle.boss" target="_blank">Revelle Jackson, a prominent Hutt Valley photographer</a>. Jackson was the official photographer for local events—including A&amp;P shows, birthday parties and weddings—for several decades, and his collection of over 8000 photos is now available for download for distribution and reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial licence.</p>
<p>When asked about other libraries following in the footsteps of UHCL, Reid points out that most libraries and archives are caught between two basic mandates: to protect the collections and to provide access. While Reid understands the dilemmas many librarians and archivists face, he says he’s “pleased to be working in a place where it does seem to lean the other way, towards openness.”</p>
<p>Reid says that he would “definitely encourage other institutions to go down this route.”</p>
<p>For smaller, regional organisations, open access and open licensing are a good way to encourage the local community to share and reuse heritage materials. “Our issue is getting people to use the stuff. Our issue is access, getting people using our collections. As soon as we are fairly sure that there aren’t any copyright claims, we want to put the work in circulation.”</p>
<p>As local groups continue to donate materials to the archive, Reid looks forward to growing Recollect. “A lot of material is coming in digital form only. We often digitise the material, and let the donors keep the original. We’re building up a lot of material like that.”</p>
<p>As the collections grow, so does the range of materials available for sharing and creative reuse. “I’ve been getting donors’ permission to use their material digitally, and this includes Creative Commons licensing. I make a point of telling people, because they might be worried or misunderstand, but no one seems that concerned. They want their images to be out there and available.”</p>
<p>“I’ve always made an effort to explain the licences to donors, and no one’s been bothered so far, to be honest. So far, everyone’s agreed.”</p>

<p></p>
<p>On November 23 and 24, InternetNZ is holding its first regional NetHui in Dunedin, <a href="http://2012-south.nethui.org.nz/" target="_blank">Nethui South</a>. As usual, <a href="http://2012-south.nethui.org.nz/programme" target="_blank">the programme</a> runs the gamut of Internet issues, including policy, governance, law, copyright, education, society, culture, business and innovation</p>
<p>For those used to specialist conferences--boasting text heavy powerpoints, unfamiliar jargon and long-winded presentations--NetHui comes as a welcome relief. Aside from the keynote addresses, NetHui is a remarkably participatory conference. In an education session at July's Auckland NetHui, I heard from teachers, government officials, private sector workers, parents, concerned citizens, librarians, and even a high school student volunteering at the event. Where else does this happen? I can think of no other event with nearly this level of popular participation. While 'unconferences' have become increasingly popular, <a href="http://2012-south.nethui.org.nz/registration" target="_blank">Nethui remains, at $40, by far the cheapest</a>, and is far more likely to include those that would be otherwise priced out of attendance.</p>
<p>So, we like Nethui. Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been proud to feature in the last two events. In the 2011 conference, Creative Commons co-founder Lawrence Lessig turned up, and we launched our popular 'CC Kiwi' video. In July 2012, we had a great discussion about the future of open access and open licensing in New Zealand's universities with academics from New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>For NetHui South, we're continuing our support. We're a community sponsor of the conference and, as usual, we're hosting <a href="http://2012-south.nethui.org.nz/programme" target="_blank">a free Creative Commons meeting<del> after</del> BEFORE the official events</a>, at 11am at the Kakapo Room of the Museum. Whether you are a teacher, student, researcher, creator, innovator or are simply curious about open culture, feel free to come along.</p>
<p>At this free meetup, you'll:</p>
<p>• Learn about ‘The New Storytelling,’ a Creative Commons Mix &amp; Mash style showcase for New Zealand students;</p>
<p>• Hear from local teachers, academics and students about the use of open licensing in education and research;</p>
<p>• Discuss the use of Creative Commons licences in culture and the arts; and</p>
<p>• Help shape the next phase of the Creative Commons project in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>In typical NetHui fashion, the meet-up will be open and participatory. Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is keen to hear about your CC experiences, answer your CC questions and learn more about your use of CC licences.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in coming along, please email <a title="Email CC" href="mailto:admin@creativecommons.org.nz">admin@creativecommons.org.nz</a></p>
<p>When: 6.30pm, Friday 23 November</p>
<p>Where: Museum</p>

             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2012-10-31T13:40:33+13:00">2012-10-31 13:40</time>

<p></p>
<p>In the<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/culturegabfest/2012/10/pitch_perfect_seth_macfarlane_and_higher_education_online_slate_s_culture.html" target="_blank"> October 10 edition of Slate Magazine's Culture podcast</a>, the hosts interviewed Al Filreis, an English professor from the University of Pennsylvania, about his class in modern and contemporary poetry. At first glance, this seems like an unusually parochial choice: however much we might want to hear Filreis' expert riff on Allan Ginsberg or Lyn Hejinian, most of us antipodeans are unlikely fly 20 hours for the privilege, let alone pay <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/about/faq.php" target="_blank">US$40, 000+ in tuition fees</a>. In fact, most of us are unlikely to even get in to this Ivy League school--ranked in 2011 as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania#Admissions_selectivity" target="_blank">sixth most selective University in the United States</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, even for a regional American podcast, this parochialism is a stretch. In reality, Filreis was interviewed because he'd recently started<a href="https://www.coursera.org/courses" target="_blank"> to teach his poetry course for free</a>, on the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera </a>platform, as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). As one of the first humanities courses on Coursera, Filreis was, as he put it, "the doggy in the window for the humanities." Eventually, over 30, 000 students worldwide registered for his course (incidentally, this is equivalent to the 31, 000 students who apply to attend UPenn each year).</p>
<p>[quote float="right"]MOOCs have quickly spread to cover nearly all subject areas in higher education[/quote]</p>
<p>Founded by Stanford University computer scientists, Coursera is one of several prominent MOOC platforms and consortia--including <a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a>, <a href="http://ocwconsortium.org/" target="_blank">OpenCourseWare</a> and <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" target="_blank">OERu</a>--to provide university-level courses to millions of students across the world, for free. Initially used to disseminate highly technical courses in engineering and computer science, MOOCs have quickly spread to cover nearly all subject areas in higher education. While OpenCourseWare has existed since 2002, recent media coverage, including the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/education/consortium-of-colleges-takes-online-education-to-new-level.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/higher-education-network-blog/2012/sep/13/mooc-buzzword-meaning-higher-education" target="_blank">Guardian</a> and <a href="http://www.listener.co.nz/commentary/the-internaut/online-learning-the-future-of-education/" target="_blank">a cover story in The Listener</a>, suggests that MOOCs have finally gone mainstream.</p>
<p>Far from being a paean to the benevolence of MOOCs, however, the Slate conversation with Filreis quickly turned to criticisms of the Coursera model. Coursera, like Udacity but unlike many other MOOC platforms, is backed by venture capitalists, and run as a for-profit company. As most MOOCs are based in prominent  US institutions, platforms like Coursera can also be seen as an expansion of the US dominance of global higher education.</p>
<p>Richard White, answering a question about MOOCs <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/open-access-a-challenge-2/" target="_blank">in the comments thread here last week</a>, nicely summed up the debate. MOOCs, he wrote, are: "Either the most fundamental transformation of tertiary learning ever or the next form of US cultural colonisation as companies and Ivy league Universities fight to be the Facebook of higher education – depending on who you listen to!"</p>
<p>Anticipating these kinds of questions, Filreis framed part of his defence of the Coursera model in terms of ownership:  [quote]"Now, they could be corrupted and taken over by venture capitalists later, but I'll be out by then. The moment we start charging a cent for tuition, I'm gone. But I have a contract that allows me to take my materials, and build another platform, or mothball it, or deliver it for free on the Net."[/quote]</p>
<p>Put this way, All Rights Reserved copyright appears to be a necessary line of defence against the potential appropriations of venture capital. While Filreis didn't mention copyright, the underlying logic was that by maintaining All Rights Reserved copyright for his teaching materials, Filreis could prevent a for-profit company like Coursera from misusing--in this case, monetising--his work. By claiming that All Rights Reserved copyright can prevent misuse, Filreis repeated an argument which has become quite familiar in the world of open licensing, usually derived from a fear of commercial appropriation or unwanted remix works.</p>
<p>While I understand Filreis' argument, if we approach the issue from a different angle, the question of copyright begins to look a little more complex. By moving away from potential misuse, we could instead ask: what are the consequences of limiting reuse and adaptation? By preventing perceived misuse, what potential uses--and what learning--might All Rights Reserved copyright prevent?</p>
<p>On this question, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/about/terms" target="_blank">Coursera's terms of use are clear</a>: "You may download material from the Sites only for your own personal, non-commercial use. You may not otherwise copy, reproduce, retransmit, distribute, publish, commercially exploit or otherwise transfer any material, nor may you modify or create derivatives works of the material."</p>
<p>[quote float="left"]By preventing perceived misuse, what potential uses--and what learning--might All Rights Reserved copyright prevent?[/quote]</p>
<p>The problem with this, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/opencontent/why-oer" target="_blank">as David Wiley puts it</a>, is that "Successful educators share most completely with the most students." By using ARR in education, learning becomes a highly structured and centralised experience; some potentially important activities for non-American learners, like remixing and sharing course materials, become illegal.</p>
<p>It is also likely that, without the ability to adapt and redistribute course materials, MOOCs will remain, to their detriment, culturally specific; this means that the accusation of 'cultural imperialism' becomes that much more likely to stick.</p>
<p>This issue becomes more stark when we consider that, according to <a href="http://www.col.org/resources/speeches/2011presentation/Pages/2011-05-16.aspx" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://www.col.org/resources/speeches/2011presentation/Pages/2011-05-16.aspx" target="_blank">reports</a> from UNESCO, we will need between 100 and 150 million extra places to meet demand from qualified students who cannot afford to access existing institutions. According to <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/pdf/RANKINGS/Stamenka-JohnDaniel.pdf" target="_blank">Stamenka Uvalić-Trumbić of UNESCO</a>, "Accommodating the additional 98 million students would require more than four major universities (30,000 students) to open every week for the next fifteen years</p>
<p>For this reason, the OER university (OERu), a consortium of higher education institutions including the University of Canterbury, Otago Polytechnic and NMIT, has decided to only use teaching materials licensed under Creative Commons. Its pilot course, <a href="http://wikieducator.org/AST1000" target="_blank">Regional Relations in Asia and the Pacific</a>, run out of the University of Southern Queensland, begins on November 23.</p>
<p>Unlike most other MOOCs, which usually offer no more than a certificate of completion, this course will be run for academic credit. As Wayne Mackintosh wrote during <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/the-oer-university/" target="_blank">our OA Week coverage</a>, "using OER<strong> </strong>it is possible to build a parallel learning universe to provide more affordable education for learners currently excluded from the formal education sector."</p>

<p><strong>The OER university: Kiwi ingenuity leads a low cost, low risk but high impact solution for open education futures worldwide</strong></p>
<p>The OER university (OERu) will provide free learning opportunities for all students worldwide using courses based solely on open educational resources (OER) and open access (OA) materials with pathways for learners to earn credible degrees. The OER Foundation, headquarted in New Zealand, is leading an international innovation partnership of accredited universities, polytechnics and community colleges committed to providing more affordable education for learners currently excluded from the formal higher education sector.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/oer_logo_EN_1_RGB.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="oer_logo_EN_1_RGB" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/oer_logo_EN_1_RGB-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="331" height="219"></a><strong>Open Educational Resources</strong> (OER) are materials used to support education that may be freely accessed, reused, modified and shared by anyone (<a title="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2011/07/open-educational-resources-definition.htmlOpen" href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2011/07/open-educational-resources-definition.htmlOpen" rel="nofollow">Downes 2011</a>). <strong>Creative Commons</strong> licenses are enabling an international network of accredited universities and polytechnics to widen access to more affordable degrees. The <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/FAQs" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/FAQs" rel="nofollow">OER Tertiary Education Network</a>, the driving force behind the <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" rel="nofollow">OER university</a> (OERu) collaboration have adopted the <a title="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition" href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition" rel="nofollow">Free Cultural Works approved licenses</a> (<a title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="nofollow">CC BY</a> and <a title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" rel="nofollow">CC BY-SA</a>) as the default for OERu courses.</p>

<p dir="LTR">With OER, the marginal cost of replicating digital learning materials is near zero and sharing development costs improves cost efficiencies. Consequently, an international <strong>network</strong> of <strong>accredited institutions</strong> would be able to leverage <strong>significant savings</strong> in the cost and time required for the assembly and maintenance of OER courses combined with significant efficiency gains when <strong>operating at scale. </strong>Moreover<strong>, </strong>OER provides a viable solution for education institutions to respond to their educational mission of social inclusion.</p>

<p>The scale is guaranteed because of the unsatisfied global demand for higher education. Researchers at UNESCO and the Commonwealth of Learning conservatively predict that over the next fifteen years, the post-secondary education system will need to provide for an additional 100 million places. The conventional model of higher education provision is simply not able to respond to this level of demand for education.</p>
<p>The confluence of these economic and digital technology enablers provide fertile ground for designing a <strong>sustainable open education ecosystem</strong> whereby institutions can provide free access to learning opportunities. Building on Professor Emeritus Jim Taylor's 2007 ideas to <a title="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/e-jist/docs/vol10_no1/papers/full_papers/taylorj.htm" href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/e-jist/docs/vol10_no1/papers/full_papers/taylorj.htm" rel="nofollow">provide assessment on demand</a>, the OERu concept was conceived.</p>

<p>Individuals are free to learn from digital materials hosted on the open web. The problem is that learners who access digital OERs on the web and acquire knowledge and skills either formally or informally, alone or in groups, cannot readily have their learning assessed and subsequently receive appropriate academic recognition for their efforts.</p>
<p>OERu learners will gain <strong>free access to high quality courses</strong> that are designed for independent-study using <strong>OER</strong>. OERu learners will receive student support through a global network of volunteers and peer support using social software technologies. Students can be <strong>assessed for a fee</strong> by participating institutions and earn a <strong>credible credential. </strong>Using OER<strong> </strong>it is possible to build a parallel learning universe to provide more affordable education for learners currently excluded from the formal education sector.</p>

<p>With a healthy dose of our Kiwi “can do” attitude which favours pragmatism above pretence, in November 2011, the OER Foundation convened an open meeting of <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" rel="nofollow">founding anchor partners</a> to plan the practical implementation of the OERu. With funding support from UNESCO, this <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" rel="nofollow">landmark meeting </a>was streamed live on the Internet modelling open participation and collaboration on a global scale. Five tertiary education institutions in New Zealand have embraced their responsibility to ensure more sustainable education futures, by joining the OERu network as <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_Founding_OERTen_anchor_partner_statements" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_Founding_OERTen_anchor_partner_statements" rel="nofollow">founding anchor partners</a>. Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, NorthTec the Open Polytechnic, Otago Polytechnic and the University of Canterbury are the New Zealand institutions who are leading open education futures in New Zealand. The <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" rel="nofollow">OERu</a> network, now numbering 20 contributing institutions will be able to accredit OER learning on five continents mapped to the credentialing frameworks of 20 different countries.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The vision of the OERu collaboration has now turned into reality with the <a title="http://wikieducator.org/Australia's_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" rel="nofollow">recent </a><a title="http://wikieducator.org/Australia's_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> of the the launch of the first OERu course,  <a title="http://wikieducator.org/AST1000" href="http://wikieducator.org/AST1000" rel="nofollow">Regional Relations in Asia and the Pacific</a> (AST1000) developed by the University of Southern Queensland.

<p>University leaders and administrators are concerned with how to ensure sustainability of OER initiatives on campus. Indeed, if OER projects are managed as an add-on to existing operations, the sources of funding to sustain OER projects can be a challenge. However, the strategic solution is to embed OER development as an integral component of business as usual.</p>
<p>From an investment-decision perspective, participation in the OERu <strong>does not require new money</strong>, but rather a reallocation of existing staff time to releasing selected development outputs under open content licenses for the OERu network as part of mainstream operations. The OERu model anticipates that no more than 1% of existing budget time would be required for release under open content licenses. The institutional costs of assessment and credentialisation services are recouped on a <strong>cost-recovery basis</strong> from student fees and/or other sources.</p>
<p>Consider for example that the average tuition fees for a 4-year bachelor degree at a public university in the United States is US$26,312, excluding accommodation and textbook costs. At Otago Polytechnic, the full tuition cost of a 4-year degree equivalent is approximately US$19,452. The summative assessment and credentialing services for the first OERu prototype course would equate to a 4-year bachelor degree costing US$6,759. As the OERu network grows and begins to leverage economies of scale, it is feasible that further cost reductions can be implemented.</p>
<p>The OERu network has succeeded in shifting the strategic focus of open education from how to achieve sustainable OER projects to how institutions will remain sustainable without the mainstream adoption of OER.</p>
<p>The OERu model is inspired by the concept of “<em>smart philanthropy</em>”. While the OERu is primarily designed to widen access to learning in higher education through the social inclusion and community service agenda, our approach encourages member institutions to reintegrate the lessons learned into mainstream operations. Tacit knowledge and capability gained through the OERu's open design and development model can be reinvested back into the core business operations to improve effectiveness of the higher education sector and generate new business opportunities now possible with the OERu model. The OERu network is an exemplar for low cost, low risk, but high impact innovation.</p>

<p>Partnering with the Royal Society of New Zealand in the publication of the Society’s eight journals, Taylor &amp; Francis’ goal is to maximize access to and discoverability of the quality research published within the journals. We have a dedicated publishing office in Melbourne, supporting our ANZ-based editors, society officers, libraries and authors on local time.</p>
<p>One of the most important elements of Taylor &amp; Francis’ objectives as a major international publisher is to work towards the goal of broad-based access to content, through our program of the sustainable publication of Open Access (OA) journals, hybrid titles and subscription-based journals.</p>
<p>In the Open Access arena our goal is one of providing the highest levels of service, quality publication and maximum flexibility, enabling OA publication through development of a range of publishing and access models and through the provision of a range of licensing options to our author communities.</p>
<p>We support authors in fulfilling funder requirements, such as the US National Institutions of Health (NIH) mandate, through content feeds of author ‘second-stage manuscripts’ (post-peer review) for them to load into their repositories, such as PubMedCentral. These feeds are also designed to help authors as we are able to undertake the mandated online posting on their behalf. We have recently reached agreement with The World Bank for deposit of their author manuscripts into their open repository, in the fields of economics and finance.</p>
<p>[quote style="boxed" float="right"]Taylor &amp; Francis now publish 17 pure OA journals.[/quote]</p>
<p>Authors across all our journals globally have the right to post their manuscripts in Open repositories, after the respective embargo period has passed (12 months for Science &amp; Technology, and 18 months for Social Sciences, Arts &amp; Humanities titles). We are experimenting in the field of Library and Information Science with a ‘zero embargo’ pilot policy whereby authors have the right to post immediately on publication in an Open repository.</p>
<p>We are working hard to engage with funders to ensure that we as Publisher, our publishing partners and our journal authors are fully compliant with mandates. At the same time our objective is to make the publishing process as problem-free as possible for our authors, editors and learned societies/journal proprietors, by offering support and guidance at all stages of the publishing process, and by offering choice to authors with regard to the nature of their publication licensing.</p>
<p>We now publish 17 pure OA journals which are branded as Taylor &amp; Francis Open and are based on the “gold” OA (or ‘author pays’) Article Publishing Charge (APC) model. We feel strongly that authors should not be prevented from publishing in these journals should they not have the means available to cover the APC, hence fee waivers are available to authors from developing countries. For our T&amp;F-owned proprietary Open titles, and titles where our society partners adopt this policy, we will be asking authors to sign the Creative Commons Attribution license (known as CC-BY), which allows for unlimited reuse, adaptation, translation, and so on of article content, provided that the work is attributed by any subsequent user. This license complies with the Research Councils UK (RCUK) and Wellcome Trust mandates, as authors in receipt of a grant from the Trust, RCUK, or one of RCUK’s constituents, must publish under this license. More information can be found on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">the Creative Commons website</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2006 we have also provided the option on subscription-based journals for authors to make their article fully open access on publication upon payment of an APC fee. We support the recent <a href="http://www.stm-assoc.org/publishers-support-sustainable-open-access/" target="_blank">STM statement on Open Access</a>, which states that: “We believe that authors should be able to publish in the journal of their choice, where publication will have the greatest potential to advance their field”. In order to facilitate this choice, from 2013, we plan to implement the T&amp;F Open Select (“Gold OA”) facility across the majority of our journals.</p>
<p>In the OA arena, and particularly when it comes to APC models, we are keenly aware of our need to provide the best levels of service and care for our author communities. We continue to work on enhancing processes, systems and turnaround times for authors, providing a state-of –the-art online platform to maximize discoverability, supplying article metrics to offer maximum transparency, as well as undertaking extensive marketing campaigns for driving usage and impact. This is in conjunction with the development of our author services more widely, as detailed on <a href="http://journalauthors.tandf.co.uk/" target="_blank">our Author Services website</a>.</p>

<h5>Dr Siouxsie Wiles</h5>
<p>A few days ago I was asked what my role is in science. It’s a question I’ve been asking myself a lot lately*. So, who am I and what is my role? I am a publicly funded <a href="http://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/sms/staffct/staff_details.aspx?staffID=7377696C333834">scientist</a> with a passion for nasty microbes and things that glow in the dark. I am also a <a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/infectious-thoughts/">blogger</a> and <a href="http://thecusp.org.nz/">podcaster</a> and have struck up a relationship with a <a href="http://lukeharrisgraphics.com/">great team of graphic artists</a> to make a series of <a href="http://youtu.be/UUUytRoI-5g">short YouTube animations</a> about glowing creatures and science. Until recently I would have said my role in science was to do research, but with a side-line in communicating science in an effort to generate public interest and excitement.</p>
<p>The fact that communication is seen almost as an optional extra in a career in science is quite astonishing, I think. Why else in this digital age of multidisciplinary science would we write papers incomprehensible to almost all but those scientists in our own narrow field? Why else would we publish in journals only accessible to those institutions with budgets big enough to afford the subscription charges? In case you were thinking that it is only small, non-research or polytechnic institutions that are affected by this, last year for example, the University of California (UC) <a href="//libraries.ucsd.edu/collections/Nature_Faculty_Letter-June_2010.pdf)" target="_blank">threatened to cancel their subscription</a> to all <a href="http://www.nature.com/" target="_blank">Nature Publishing Group</a> (NPG) journals after NPG wanted to increase the price of UC’s licence by 400%. This is also a problem in New Zealand universities.  Both as a scientist and a blogger, I’ve often wanted to read a paper that wasn’t available through my institutional subscription. With time at a premium, I find that I don’t bother going through the hoops of trying to get hold of the paper by other means. Are my peers doing the same with my papers? If they are, presumably, this will affect how widely my research is cited.</p>
<p>[quote style="boxed" float="right"]We scientists need to change the way we write about our work[/quote]</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I started my <a href="http://siouxsiewiles.blogspot.co.nz/" target="_blank">own research group</a> a few years ago, and had to take responsibility for deciding which journal to submit papers to, that I realised just how ridiculous the traditional model of science publishing is. In essence the tax payer funds my research, pays for me to publish it (in the form of colour page charges as a lot of my data is presented using colour figures) and then every institution, be it university or Crown Research Institute, in New Zealand has to pay subscription charges so that other scientists here can read what I’ve discovered. This strikes me as a terrible waste of resources – resources which could be used to fund more research, rather than provide obscene profits for giant publishing houses. This is why I support the Open Access model offered by the likes of the <a href="http://www.plos.org/" target="_blank">Public Library of Science (PLOS)</a> and <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank">BioMed Central (BMC)</a>. These platforms charge a fee to publish but then the material is freely available to all under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</a> where the authors retain copyright for their article.</p>
<p>But the Open Access ‘movement’ has the potential to do more than just improve my citations and allow more money to be spent on doing science. Opening up the fruits of scientific research to anyone with access to the internet changes everything.  It gives people access to the science they fund. The importance of this was brought home to me recently when I attended a talk by University of Otago archaeologist, <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/anthropology/arch/people/walter.html" target="_blank">Prof. Richard Walter</a>. Prof. Walter was discussing the dubious evidence for alternative theories of how humans came to colonise New Zealand. What frustrated him most, he said, was the ease with which such ‘evidence’ perpetuated on the internet, while the real science behind New Zealand’s colonisation is only available in scientific journals behind a pay wall. The same can be said for alternative views on the safety of vaccination and other health issues.</p>
<p>But herein lies the challenge. For Open Access to really be useful for the public at large, we scientists need to change the way we write about our work. At the very least, every paper published under an Open Access banner should have a summary of the main findings that can be understood by a general audience. Even better would be for whole articles to be written in this way, so that scientists from diverse fields can read each other’s work without needing Wikipedia and a dictionary.</p>
<p>So how do I see my role in science now? Well, the doing science bit hasn’t changed. But I now see that a desire to get the public excited about science isn’t enough. I live in a country bucking international trends with increasing rates of infectious diseases (1**), where sexually transmitted diseases are a growing cause of infertility, and where misinformation on vaccination and health endanger lives. Science can empower people to make informed choices that shape their future for the better. This is the message I want to communicate and why I believe unrestricted access to the science we fund is in everyone’s best interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Partly as a result of numerous chats with the wonderful Jacquie Bay, director of the <a href="http://www.lenscience.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/" target="_blank">Liggins Education Network for Science</a> at the University of Auckland, a fantastic initiative that promotes connections between schools and scientists. Partly because I was lucky enough to attend the late Sir Paul Callaghan’s <a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/events/2012-transit-of-venus-forum-lifting-our-horizon/" target="_blank">Transit of Venus Forum</a> in Gisborne earlier this year.</li>

<p>Universities have long been accused of operating in an ivory tower, separate from the rest of society. One area where this characterisation is fairly accurate is in the accessibility of university research works. The current system of scholarly communication places most articles from most authors behind a ‘paywall’ at a publisher’s website. How well does this arrangement support the role of universities in society?</p>
<p>A common description of the role of a university is that it should act as a critic and conscience of society. In New Zealand, this role is explicitly laid out in legislation, in <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM183668.htm" target="_blank">Section 162 (4) (a) (v) of the Education Act 1989</a> (l).</p>
<p>Jones, Galvin and Woodhouse (2000) addressed this role and commented:</p>
<p style="padding-left:270px;">“Research and publication go hand in hand, so much so that both are crucially dependent upon the existence of academic freedom. Put another way, academic freedom to conduct research but not publish the results of that research is a sham.”</p>

<p>They did not address where the research is published or how easy it might be for members of society to access research findings. Although there are no calculations of exactly where New Zealand research is published, it is likely that most research authored by researchers at New Zealand universities is behind publishers’ paywalls.</p>
<p>Two of the main arguments for allowing society at large access to the results of university research are:</p>
<ul>
<li>that research has typically been supported, in some way,  through public funding;</li>

    <li>that legislation and policy that impacts on society is often based on research findings.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/nz-university-system" target="_blank">Universities New Zealand</a> break down the income to universities as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">"The New Zealand universities receive approximately 40% of their annual income from government grants - $1.3 billion of the combined total income of $3.1 billion recorded in 2010.  The remaining income is split evenly between student fees and other sources – principally research contracts and trading income.”</p>

<p>Student fees are significantly facilitated through the student loans system and research contracts are often derived from public funds; public assistance, then, in some form, is inherent in most university research. Do members of the public have a right to access these research results? Do they have a right to freely access these results? Where research is used to inform government policy then there is a straightforward case that those who will be affected by new laws should have easy access to the underlying evidence.</p>
<p>Funding agencies around the world are increasingly recognising that they should aim for the widest distribution of the articles describing research they have funded (or rather, that taxpayers have funded). This position has been <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/RCUK%20_Policy_on_Access_to_Research_Outputs.pdf" target="_blank">summarised recently by Research Councils UK</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“As major bodies charged with investing public money in research, the Research Councils take responsibility in making the outputs from this research publicly available – not just to other researchers, but also to potential users in business, charitable and public sectors, and to the general public.”</p>

<p>Statements such as these represent  a shift in attitudes toward scholarly communication. The evolution of academic publishing allowed researchers to direct their major outputs to journals that were largely unknown and mostly inaccessible to the general public. Communication of research results to wider society, or outreach, has been regarded as an extra and distinct activity that not all academics engaged in. In addition, the value system within academia has focussed on publishing in these (to many, obscure) journals.</p>
<p>[quote style="boxed" float="right"]The stereotypical ivory tower characterisation of academics has been largely consistent with their publishing practices[/quote]</p>
<p>All these behaviours have reinforced a separation between university research and society; the stereotypical ivory tower characterisation of academics has been largely consistent with their publishing practices. Although these articles can be accessed via public libraries they require extra effort on the part of information searchers. The reality of our connected society is that information access is often practically a matter of whether a document is instantly available on the internet.</p>
<p>A counter-argument that questions the value of public open access to university research is whether the general public can usefully engage with primary research documents. Although there are clearly examples where this is true the growing education levels of society in general suggest the force of this argument will fade over time. From the perspective of an individual university then one segment of society who would clearly be able to benefit from access are their own alumni. The value of public access to research across society as a whole is shown in the variety of scenarios gathered at <a href="http://whoneedsaccess.org/">whoneedsaccess.org</a></p>
<p>In conclusion, it is unreasonable for universities to claim to act as a critic and conscience of society when the results of those explorations are largely placed behind financial and logistical barriers. Whilst there are a variety of ways for academics to engage with society, the single simplest approach is to allow society to easily access their work.</p>

<p>I think I met Penny Carnaby, then National Librarian, back in 2010.</p>
<p>She did not have to convince me about the value of Open Access. What I did learn from her was that Open Access had implications that went beyond the value of sharing scientific findings as broadly as possible. Science after all is a human activity, and as such, part of our cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Until then I thought of research publications as being about sharing results – or rather making them publicly known. There is value in that, and the more broadly access to those findings is given, and the more flexible the licenses for reuse that are attached to them, the better. Open Access under open licenses allows that. But when challenged with the idea of the cultural heritage of science I started thinking about what science is – and about how there is much more to science than just that published article.</p>
<p>Research articles constitute a narrative that is built around the gathered data. The structure of that story is partly defined by the data, the models prescribed by scholarly publishers, and to some extent, the audience - primarily other researchers. This narrative, however, does not necessarily reflect the <em>process</em> of science –a process that produced the data in the first place.</p>
<p><a title="pottery by gnackgnackgnack, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnackgnackgnack/4367460746/"><img src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4065/4367460746_81ec439c78.jpg" alt="pottery" width="325" height="216"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gnackgnackgnack/4367460746/">Pottery</a> by gnackgnackgnack, via Flickr.

<p>A lot of what happens in science that ultimately leads to the “paper” takes the form of conversations around small tables, reading and reflections on the bus, or seemingly random thoughts on a sleepless night. We struggle with things we don’t understand. We seek advice from our colleagues or information in the published literature. We talk a lot – at lab meetings, conferences, holding a pipette over the bench, or while trying to figure out what that strange structure under the microscope is. That is the science happening. The article is what happens after all of that is done and dusted, and rarely, if ever, does it share what got us to that point.</p>
<p>There is no room in the scholarly article to capture that process. Yet, I’d like to argue, understanding this process is crucial for understanding science. The paper helps us get the knowledge. But the science lives in that messy and wonderful process. You can’t become a scientist by reading journal articles – you learn to be a scientist by <em>being </em>a scientist and participating in that array of human activities that form part of the cultural experience of science.</p>
<p>I am grateful to Penny for making me look at science as a human activity – not unlike writing a book, moulding a pot out of clay, or painting a landscape. And like these other activities, preserving the end product is easier than capturing the process. But unlike these other creators, we scientists are in the unique position of not directly profiting from the sales of our creative output. As Peter Suber eloquently puts it:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“It’s enough to know that their employers pay them salaries, freeing them to give away their work, that they write for impact rather than money, and that they score career points when they make the kind of impact they hoped to make.”[1]</p>

<p>There is nothing in today’s technology that prevents us from freely sharing our findings. So why not start sharing more openly and broadly both the process and the final manuscripts? Why not make sure those articles can be preserved, used, re-used, mixed and mashed by institutions and individuals?</p>
<p>I say it is time to say goodbye to ‘publish or perish’ and time to say hello to ‘share or perish’.</p>

<h5>Cameron Neylon</h5>
<p>[This post was originally published on Cameron Neylon's blog, <a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-challenge-for-scholarly-societies/" target="_blank">Science in the Open</a>, under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication</a>.]</p>
<p>With major governments signalling a shift to Open Access it seems like a good time to be asking which organisations in the scholarly communications space will survive the transition. It is likely that the major current publishers will survive, although relative market share and focus is likely to change. But the biggest challenges are faced by small to medium scholarly societies that depend on journal income for their current viability. What changes are necessary for them to navigate this transition and can they survive?</p>
<p>The fate of scholarly societies is one of the most contentious and even emotional in the open access landscape. Many researchers have strong emotional ties to their disciplinary societies and these societies often play a crucial role in supporting meetings, providing travel stipends to young researchers, awarding prizes, and representing the community. At the same time they face a peculiar bind. The money that supports these efforts often comes from journal subscriptions. Researchers are very attached to the benefits but seem disinclined to countenance membership fees that would support them. This problem is seen across many parts of the research enterprise – where researchers, or at least their institutions, are paying for services through subscriptions but unwilling to pay for them directly.</p>
<p>[quote style="boxed" float="right"]The fate of scholarly societies is one of the most contentious and even emotional in the open access landscape[/quote]</p>
<p>What options do societies have? Those with a large publication program could do worse in the short term than look very closely at the <a href="http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2012/gold-for-gold-rsc-open-access.asp">announcement</a> from the UK <a title="Royal Society of Chemistry" href="http://www.rsc.org/" target="_blank">Royal Society of Chemistry</a> in July 2012. The RSC is offering an institutional mechanism whereby those institutions that have a particular level of subscription will receive an equivalent amount of publication services, set at the price of £1600 per paper. This is very clever for the RSC: it allows it to help institutions prepare effectively for changes in UK policy, it costs them nothing, and lets them experiment with a route to transition to full open access at relatively low risk. Because the contribution of UK institutions with this particular subscription plan is relatively small it is unlikely to reduce subscriptions significantly in the short term, but if and when it does it positions the RSC to offer package deals on publication services with very similar terms. Tactically by moving early it also allows the RSC to hold a higher price point than later movers will – and will help to increase its market share in the UK over that of the ACS.</p>
<p>Another route is for societies to explore the “indy band model”. Similar to bands that are trying to break through by giving away their recorded material but charging for live gigs, societies could focus on raising money through meetings rather than publications. Some societies already do this – having historically focussed on running large scale international or national meetings. The “in person” experience is something that cannot yet be done cheaply over the internet and “must attend” meetings offer significant income and sponsorship opportunities. There are challenges to be navigated here – ensuring commercial contributions don’t damage the brand or reduce the quality of meetings being a big one – but expect conference fees to rise as subscription incomes drop. Societies that currently run lavish meetings off the back of journal income will face a particular struggle over the next two to five years.</p>
<p>But even meetings are unlikely to offer a long term solution. It’s some way off yet but rising costs of travel and increasing quality of videoconferencing will start to eat into this market as well. If all the big speakers are dialling it in, is it still worth attending the meeting? So what are the real value offerings that societies can provide? What are the things that are unique to that community collection of expertise that no-one else can provide?</p>
<p>Peer review (pre-, post-, or peri-publication) is one of them. Publication services are not. Publication, in the narrow sense of “making public”, will be commoditised, if it hasn’t already. With new players like <a href="http://peerj.com/">PeerJ</a> and <a href="http://f1000research.com/">F1000 Research</a> alongside the now fairly familiar landscape of the wide-ranging <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PBinfield/ssp-presentation4">megajournal</a> the space for publication services to make fat profits is narrowing rapidly. This will, sooner or later, be a low margin business with a range of options to choose from when someone, whether a society or a single researcher, is looking for a platform to publish their work. While the rest of us may argue whether this will happen next year or in a decade, for societies it is the long term that matters, and in the long term commoditisation will happen.</p>
<p>The unique offering that a society brings is the <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/the-economics-of-scientific-collaboration/">aggregation and organisation of expert attention</a>. In a given space a scholarly society has a unique capacity to coordinate and organise assessment by domain experts. I can certainly imagine a society offering peer review as a core member service, independent of whether the thing being reviewed is already “published”. This might be a particular case where there are real benefits to operating a small scale – both because of the peer pressure for each member of the community to pull their weight and because the scale of the community lends itself to being understood and managed as a small set of partly connected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">small world networks</a>. The question is really whether the sums add up. Will members pay $100 or $500 per year for peer review services? Would that provide enough income? What about younger members without grants? And perhaps crucially, how cheap would a separated publication platform have to be to make the sums look good?</p>
<p>Societies are all about community. Arguably most completely missed the boat on the potential of the social web when they could have built community hubs of real value – and those that didn’t miss it entirely largely created badly built and ill thought through community forums well after the first flush of failed generic “Facebook for Science” clones had faded. But another chance is coming. As the ratchet moves on funder and government open access policies, society journals stuck in a subscription model will become increasingly unattractive options for publication. The slow rate of progress and disciplinary differences will allow some to hold on past the point of no return and these societies will wither and die. Some societies will investigate transitional pricing models. I commend the example of the RSC to small societies as something to look at closely. Some may choose to move to publishing collections in larger journals where they retain editorial control. My bet is that those that survive will be the ones that find a way to make the combined expertise of the community pay – and I think the place to look for that will be those societies that find ways to decouple the value they offer through peer review from the costs of publication services.</p>
