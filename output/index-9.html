<h5>David Nichols</h5>
<p>Universities have long been accused of operating in an ivory tower, separate from the rest of society. One area where this characterisation is fairly accurate is in the accessibility of university research works. The current system of scholarly communication places most articles from most authors behind a ‘paywall’ at a publisher’s website. How well does this arrangement support the role of universities in society?</p>
<p>A common description of the role of a university is that it should act as a critic and conscience of society. In New Zealand, this role is explicitly laid out in legislation, in <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM183668.htm" target="_blank">Section 162 (4) (a) (v) of the Education Act 1989</a> (l).</p>
<p>Jones, Galvin and Woodhouse (2000) addressed this role and commented:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“Research and publication go hand in hand, so much so that both are crucially dependent upon the existence of academic freedom. Put another way, academic freedom to conduct research but not publish the results of that research is a sham.”</p>

<p>They did not address where the research is published or how easy it might be for members of society to access research findings. Although there are no calculations of exactly where New Zealand research is published, it is likely that most research authored by researchers at New Zealand universities is behind publishers’ paywalls.</p>
<p>Two of the main arguments for allowing society at large access to the results of university research are:</p>
<ul>
<li>that research has typically been supported, in some way,  through public funding;</li>

    <li>that legislation and policy that impacts on society is often based on research findings.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/nz-university-system" target="_blank">Universities New Zealand</a> break down the income to universities as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The New Zealand universities receive approximately 40% of their annual income from government grants - $1.3 billion of the combined total income of $3.1 billion recorded in 2010.  The remaining income is split evenly between student fees and other sources – principally research contracts and trading income.”</p>

<p>Student fees are significantly facilitated through the student loans system and research contracts are often derived from public funds; public assistance, then, in some form, is inherent in most university research. Do members of the public have a right to access these research results? Do they have a right to freely access these results? Where research is used to inform government policy then there is a straightforward case that those who will be affected by new laws should have easy access to the underlying evidence.</p>
<p>Funding agencies around the world are increasingly recognising that they should aim for the widest distribution of the articles describing research they have funded (or rather, that taxpayers have funded). This position has been <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/RCUK%20_Policy_on_Access_to_Research_Outputs.pdf" target="_blank">summarised recently by Research Councils UK</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“As major bodies charged with investing public money in research, the Research Councils take responsibility in making the outputs from this research publicly available – not just to other researchers, but also to potential users in business, charitable and public sectors, and to the general public.”</p>

<p>Statements such as these represent  a shift in attitudes toward scholarly communication. The evolution of academic publishing allowed researchers to direct their major outputs to journals that were largely unknown and mostly inaccessible to the general public. Communication of research results to wider society, or outreach, has been regarded as an extra and distinct activity that not all academics engaged in. In addition, the value system within academia has focussed on publishing in these (to many, obscure) journals.</p>
<p>All these behaviours have reinforced a separation between university research and society; the stereotypical ivory tower characterisation of academics has been largely consistent with their publishing practices. Although these articles can be accessed via public libraries they require extra effort on the part of information searchers. The reality of our connected society is that information access is often practically a matter of whether a document is instantly available on the internet.</p>
<p>A counter-argument that questions the value of public open access to university research is whether the general public can usefully engage with primary research documents. Although there are clearly examples where this is true the growing education levels of society in general suggest the force of this argument will fade over time. From the perspective of an individual university then one segment of society who would clearly be able to benefit from access are their own alumni. The value of public access to research across society as a whole is shown in the variety of scenarios gathered at <a href="http://whoneedsaccess.org/">whoneedsaccess.org</a></p>
<p>In conclusion, it is unreasonable for universities to claim to act as a critic and conscience of society when the results of those explorations are largely placed behind financial and logistical barriers. Whilst there are a variety of ways for academics to engage with society, the single simplest approach is to allow society to easily access their work.</p>

<h5>By Dr Siouxsie Wiles</h5>
<p>A few days ago I was asked what my role is in science. It’s a question I’ve been asking myself a lot lately*. So, who am I and what is my role? I am a publicly funded <a href="http://www.fmhs.auckland.ac.nz/sms/staffct/staff_details.aspx?staffID=7377696C333834">scientist</a> with a passion for nasty microbes and things that glow in the dark. I am also a <a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/infectious-thoughts/">blogger</a> and <a href="http://thecusp.org.nz/">podcaster</a> and have struck up a relationship with a <a href="http://lukeharrisgraphics.com/">great team of graphic artists</a> to make a series of <a href="http://youtu.be/UUUytRoI-5g">short YouTube animations</a> about glowing creatures and science. Until recently I would have said my role in science was to do research, but with a side-line in communicating science in an effort to generate public interest and excitement.</p>
<p>The fact that communication is seen almost as an optional extra in a career in science is quite astonishing, I think. Why else in this digital age of multidisciplinary science would we write papers incomprehensible to almost all but those scientists in our own narrow field? Why else would we publish in journals only accessible to those institutions with budgets big enough to afford the subscription charges? In case you were thinking that it is only small, non-research or polytechnic institutions that are affected by this, last year for example, the University of California (UC) <a href="//libraries.ucsd.edu/collections/Nature_Faculty_Letter-June_2010.pdf)" target="_blank">threatened to cancel their subscription</a> to all <a href="http://www.nature.com/" target="_blank">Nature Publishing Group</a> (NPG) journals after NPG wanted to increase the price of UC’s licence by 400%. This is also a problem in New Zealand universities.  Both as a scientist and a blogger, I’ve often wanted to read a paper that wasn’t available through my institutional subscription. With time at a premium, I find that I don’t bother going through the hoops of trying to get hold of the paper by other means. Are my peers doing the same with my papers? If they are, presumably, this will affect how widely my research is cited.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I started my <a href="http://siouxsiewiles.blogspot.co.nz/" target="_blank">own research group</a> a few years ago, and had to take responsibility for deciding which journal to submit papers to, that I realised just how ridiculous the traditional model of science publishing is. In essence the tax payer funds my research, pays for me to publish it (in the form of colour page charges as a lot of my data is presented using colour figures) and then every institution, be it university or Crown Research Institute, in New Zealand has to pay subscription charges so that other scientists here can read what I’ve discovered. This strikes me as a terrible waste of resources – resources which could be used to fund more research, rather than provide obscene profits for giant publishing houses. This is why I support the Open Access model offered by the likes of the <a href="http://www.plos.org/" target="_blank">Public Library of Science (PLOS)</a> and <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/" target="_blank">BioMed Central (BMC)</a>. These platforms charge a fee to publish but then the material is freely available to all under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</a> where the authors retain copyright for their article.</p>
<p>But the Open Access ‘movement’ has the potential to do more than just improve my citations and allow more money to be spent on doing science. Opening up the fruits of scientific research to anyone with access to the internet changes everything.  It gives people access to the science they fund. The importance of this was brought home to me recently when I attended a talk by University of Otago archaeologist, <a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/anthropology/arch/people/walter.html" target="_blank">Prof. Richard Walter</a>. Prof. Walter was discussing the dubious evidence for alternative theories of how humans came to colonise New Zealand. What frustrated him most, he said, was the ease with which such ‘evidence’ perpetuated on the internet, while the real science behind New Zealand’s colonisation is only available in scientific journals behind a pay wall. The same can be said for alternative views on the safety of vaccination and other health issues.</p>
<p>But herein lies the challenge. For Open Access to really be useful for the public at large, we scientists need to change the way we write about our work. At the very least, every paper published under an Open Access banner should have a summary of the main findings that can be understood by a general audience. Even better would be for whole articles to be written in this way, so that scientists from diverse fields can read each other’s work without needing Wikipedia and a dictionary.</p>
<p>So how do I see my role in science now? Well, the doing science bit hasn’t changed. But I now see that a desire to get the public excited about science isn’t enough. I live in a country bucking international trends with increasing rates of infectious diseases (1**), where sexually transmitted diseases are a growing cause of infertility, and where misinformation on vaccination and health endanger lives. Science can empower people to make informed choices that shape their future for the better. This is the message I want to communicate and why I believe unrestricted access to the science we fund is in everyone’s best interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Partly as a result of numerous chats with the wonderful Jacquie Bay, director of the <a href="http://www.lenscience.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/" target="_blank">Liggins Education Network for Science</a> at the University of Auckland, a fantastic initiative that promotes connections between schools and scientists. Partly because I was lucky enough to attend the late Sir Paul Callaghan’s <a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/events/2012-transit-of-venus-forum-lifting-our-horizon/" target="_blank">Transit of Venus Forum</a> in Gisborne earlier this year.</li>

<p><strong>The OER university: Kiwi ingenuity leads a low cost, low risk but high impact solution for open education futures worldwide</strong></p>
<p>The OER university (OERu) will provide free learning opportunities for all students worldwide using courses based solely on open educational resources (OER) and open access (OA) materials with pathways for learners to earn credible degrees. The OER Foundation, headquarted in New Zealand, is leading an international innovation partnership of accredited universities, polytechnics and community colleges committed to providing more affordable education for learners currently excluded from the formal higher education sector.</p>
<p dir="LTR"><strong>Open Educational Resources</strong> (OER) are materials used to support education that may be freely accessed, reused, modified and shared by anyone (<a title="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2011/07/open-educational-resources-definition.htmlOpen" href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2011/07/open-educational-resources-definition.htmlOpen" rel="nofollow">Downes 2011</a>). <strong>Creative Commons</strong> licenses are enabling an international network of accredited universities and polytechnics to widen access to more affordable degrees. The <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/FAQs" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/FAQs" rel="nofollow">OER Tertiary Education Network</a>, the driving force behind the <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" rel="nofollow">OER university</a> (OERu) collaboration have adopted the <a title="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition" href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition" rel="nofollow">Free Cultural Works approved licenses</a> (<a title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" rel="nofollow">CC BY</a> and <a title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/" rel="nofollow">CC BY-SA</a>) as the default for OERu courses.</p>

<p dir="LTR">With OER, the marginal cost of replicating digital learning materials is near zero and sharing development costs improves cost efficiencies. Consequently, an international <strong>network</strong> of <strong>accredited institutions</strong> would be able to leverage <strong>significant savings</strong> in the cost and time required for the assembly and maintenance of OER courses combined with significant efficiency gains when <strong>operating at scale. </strong>Moreover<strong>, </strong>OER provides a viable solution for education institutions to respond to their educational mission of social inclusion.</p>

<p>The scale is guaranteed because of the unsatisfied global demand for higher education. Researchers at UNESCO and the Commonwealth of Learning conservatively predict that over the next fifteen years, the post-secondary education system will need to provide for an additional 100 million places. The conventional model of higher education provision is simply not able to respond to this level of demand for education.</p>
<p>The confluence of these economic and digital technology enablers provide fertile ground for designing a <strong>sustainable open education ecosystem</strong> whereby institutions can provide free access to learning opportunities. Building on Professor Emeritus Jim Taylor's 2007 ideas to <a title="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/e-jist/docs/vol10_no1/papers/full_papers/taylorj.htm" href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/e-jist/docs/vol10_no1/papers/full_papers/taylorj.htm" rel="nofollow">provide assessment on demand</a>, the OERu concept was conceived.</p>
<p>Individuals are free to learn from digital materials hosted on the open web. The problem is that learners who access digital OERs on the web and acquire knowledge and skills either formally or informally, alone or in groups, cannot readily have their learning assessed and subsequently receive appropriate academic recognition for their efforts.</p>
<p>OERu learners will gain <strong>free access to high quality courses</strong> that are designed for independent-study using <strong>OER</strong>. OERu learners will receive student support through a global network of volunteers and peer support using social software technologies. Students can be <strong>assessed for a fee</strong> by participating institutions and earn a <strong>credible credential. </strong>Using OERit is possible to build a parallel learning universe to provide more affordable education for learners currently excluded from the formal education sector.</p>
<p>With a healthy dose of our Kiwi “can do” attitude which favours pragmatism above pretence, in November 2011, the OER Foundation convened an open meeting of <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" rel="nofollow">founding anchor partners</a> to plan the practical implementation of the OERu. With funding support from UNESCO, this <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" rel="nofollow">landmark meeting </a>was streamed live on the Internet modelling open participation and collaboration on a global scale. Five tertiary education institutions in New Zealand have embraced their responsibility to ensure more sustainable education futures, by joining the OERu network as <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_Founding_OERTen_anchor_partner_statements" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_Founding_OERTen_anchor_partner_statements" rel="nofollow">founding anchor partners</a>. Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, NorthTec the Open Polytechnic, Otago Polytechnic and the University of Canterbury are the New Zealand institutions who are leading open education futures in New Zealand. The <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" rel="nofollow">OERu</a> network, now numbering 20 contributing institutions will be able to accredit OER learning on five continents mapped to the credentialing frameworks of 20 different countries.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The vision of the OERu collaboration has now turned into reality with the <a title="http://wikieducator.org/Australia's_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" rel="nofollow">recent </a><a title="http://wikieducator.org/Australia's_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> of the the launch of the first OERu course,  <a title="http://wikieducator.org/AST1000" href="http://wikieducator.org/AST1000" rel="nofollow">Regional Relations in Asia and the Pacific</a> (AST1000) developed by the University of Southern Queensland. Professor Jan Thomas, Vice Chancellor and President of the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) <a title="http://wikieducator.org/Australia's_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" rel="nofollow">noted that</a>: “USQ is proud to give students worldwide, the ability to access university level courses and where <strong>cost has been removed as a barrier to learning</strong>”.</p>

<p>University leaders and administrators are concerned with how to ensure sustainability of OER initiatives on campus. Indeed, if OER projects are managed as an add-on to existing operations, the sources of funding to sustain OER projects can be a challenge. However, the strategic solution is to embed OER development as an integral component of business as usual.</p>
<p>From an investment-decision perspective, participation in the OERu <strong>does not require new money</strong>, but rather a reallocation of existing staff time to releasing selected development outputs under open content licenses for the OERu network as part of mainstream operations. The OERu model anticipates that no more than 1% of existing budget time would be required for release under open content licenses. The institutional costs of assessment and credentialisation services are recouped on a <strong>cost-recovery basis</strong> from student fees and/or other sources.</p>
<p>Consider for example that the average tuition fees for a 4-year bachelor degree at a public university in the United States is US$26,312, excluding accommodation and textbook costs. At Otago Polytechnic, the full tuition cost of a 4-year degree equivalent is approximately US$19,452. The summative assessment and credentialing services for the first OERu prototype course would equate to a 4-year bachelor degree costing US$6,759. As the OERu network grows and begins to leverage economies of scale, it is feasible that further cost reductions can be implemented.</p>
<p>The OERu network has succeeded in shifting the strategic focus of open education from how to achieve sustainable OER projects to how institutions will remain sustainable without the mainstream adoption of OER.</p>
<p>The OERu model is inspired by the concept of “<em>smart philanthropy</em>”. While the OERu is primarily designed to widen access to learning in higher education through the social inclusion and community service agenda, our approach encourages member institutions to reintegrate the lessons learned into mainstream operations. Tacit knowledge and capability gained through the OERu's open design and development model can be reinvested back into the core business operations to improve effectiveness of the higher education sector and generate new business opportunities now possible with the OERu model.

<p>3.5 inch floppy.  That’s the medium I stored my thesis on when I finally completed it in 1996.  I don’t have any of these disks left – or a machine that will read them for that matter – so the only copies I have of my thesis are the physical ones I got back with examiners’ scribbles on and one of the three hard copies I had to get bound.  Another of these will be sitting in the library here at the University of Otago on the reference shelves behind the front desks, unless it’s been moved into the archives for the benefit of posterity.</p>
<p>At the time it didn’t even occur to me that I could publish it in any other way that would allow anyone outside of Otago to find it, let alone read it.  After all these were the days of dial up, where high-tech web sites like the Yahoo! home page were made up of a series of text links.</p>
<p><img id="internal-source-marker_0.9908701623638819" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3ieuuAwPooQseuAkO5NjmZ6A8XqrQ1ivUKXWe7a4WwyAeO-95FWCexX62UMbsm5QoIV8-_lNkA1iKUfIjaW7KpGM__5VJV6WeN54aYGIJlxY5GyMDxk" alt="" width="287" height="290"> Source: Wayback Machine, yahoo.com, 23 December 1996</p>
<p>I make these nostalgic meanderings to demonstrate how far we’ve come in such a short time.  Probably the first time it occurred to me that my magnum opus could be made available to all and sundry was when I discovered (by accident, when googling myself one day) that <a href="http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=YXCVMgAACAAJ&amp;dq=satire+and+dickens+richard+white&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-LsHkBtNBf&amp;sig=c1JbmmLFytBRDd1g59tlYpLqx9k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PV1-UMX2CYLPrQf8joHIBg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ">Google Books had indexed it</a>.  Now, of course, students and staff can publish in their library’s institutional repositories, each with its own catchy title (ours being – excuse the bias – one of the better acronyms out there: the <a href="http://otago.ourarchive.ac.nz/">Otago University Research Archive</a> or OUR Archive).  And these repositories are assuming increasing importance as the academic community discusses how open access publishing might work.  Anyone reading my ramblings here is likely to be familiar with the UK’s <a href="https://webmail.staff.otago.ac.nz/owa/redir.aspx?C=3oPMcSj4xEunMFQs8BokU2EhWGvNf88IWW2l1JymctLqFTVl2elS_B13mSqq0ZF83od__n1Jd30.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.researchinfonet.org%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f06%2fFinch-Group-report-executive-summary-FINAL-VERSION.pdf">Finch report</a> and subsequent declarations from UK and European research Councils that publicly-funded research will  soon be required to be published in some open form.  Australia’s two major funding agencies, the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) have made similar noises, with the latter careful to include the ‘Green,’ self-archiving model made possible by institutional repositories as one of the possible models.  (Librarians inform me, by the way, that Australia’s institutional repository infrastructure is built on the same technology New Zealand’s).</p>
<p>Internationally things are happening at a lightening pace (for academia anyway).  To me one of the most interesting recent initiatives has been the <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/media/HowOpenIsIt.shtml">Open Access Spectrum discussion paper</a> released by PLOS, SPARC and OASPA.  The general tenet of the document was to move the conversation from “is it open access” to “how open is it?”</p>
<p>We wait to see what the NZ government or our major funding agencies say.  The NZ Government has made its own <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/declaration-open-and-transparent-government">Declaration on Open &amp; Transparent Government</a> and developed the Creative Commons-powered <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/nzgoal/read-nzgoal">Open Access &amp; Licensing Framework</a> as a guide to open access and licensing for state sector agencies to realise the potential benefits of widening access to the “vast quantities” of information and data they hold.  Interestingly, the Framework specifically excluded tertiary education institutions from its remit (see section 7(c)), presumably largely because it is far more difficult to say who actually owns the intellectual property in this sector.  But as yet there is no sign of a mandate that publicly-funded research must be made publicly available, though commentators suggest <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/openotago/2012/07/27/scientists-say-open-access-research-inevitable-in-nz-from-radio-nz/">this is inevitable</a>.</p>
<p>So, in the context of all these developments, where are we at really in the NZ tertiary sector?  If this is inevitable, how ready are we for this fundamental shift in mindset?  Let me add some local colour by providing my own perceptions in my role as Copyright Officer at the University of Otago.</p>
<p>Since all of these developments are underpinned by Creative Commons licensing, I think it’s worth asking what does the average academic know about CC?  Well, in 2012 the University had to undertake a survey of certain types of copyright material, which I was in charge of, so I took this opportunity to ask this very question.  In a section of the survey that asked about their practices in relation to copyright, I asked staff to rate from 1 to 5 how true a number of statements were for them, 1 being not true at all and 5 being completely true.  Based on over 800 responses, this was the result for my question about CC:</p>

<p>Almost half of our teaching staff rated their knowledge of Creative Commons at the lowest level on the scale.  When I broke this down according to the seniority of the staff (imagining that an elbow-patch-cardiganed professor would know a lot less than an iPad-Tweeting teaching fellow), the proportions hardly altered.  But I shouldn’t have been surprised.  This result reflects the inquiries I deal with on a day-to-day basis.  I am often the first person to tell many about this thing called CC; with others it’s something they’ve seen or heard of but are not really sure what it is all about.</p>
<p>Then what about our own institutional repository?  With help from our Digital Services Co-ordinator (and fellow CC advocate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Initiatives_lib">Allison Brown</a>, we’ve tracked repository deposits over the last 12 months to see what sort of access rights people are assigning to their work.  On average each month more than 50% of our staff and students making deposits are choosing ‘open access’ (which in this context means anyone can access it online but that it may still be all rights reserved).  The remainder chose ‘abstract only’ or ‘abstract only / inter-library loan.’    There are hints that the percentage of those choosing open access is increasing.</p>
<p>My experience is that there is still little understanding of the distinction between open <em>access</em> and <em>open</em> access.  And, yes, I did mean to write it that way to illustrate the point that the term means different things to different people. It’s the same with the MOOCs that are taking the higher education learning world by storm, where the courses are open for anyone to <em>access </em>but the resources themselves are not <em>open</em> access that I could re-use if I wanted to.</p>
<p>The very helpful <a href="http://nzresearch.org.nz/advanced_searches/new?locale=en">advanced search</a> on <a href="http://nzresearch.org.nz/">nzresearch.org.nz</a>, which indexes repositories across 10 NZ institutions, allows you to check which of these are recorded as having a licence that allows sharing, modification and commercial use.  Filtering by the University of Otago brings up 2,168 works in total: 2,146 of these are recorded as all rights reserved.  In other words, though all of these are open in terms of access, they are not in terms of re-use.  Do the advanced search for yourself, select the organisation of your choice, and you’ll find that you do not fare any better.  Of the over 30,000 works indexed only about 250 are recorded as having one of the more permissive licences.  And if you thought that choosing, say, only 2012 works would work out better, think again: that gives you 30 out of 1298.</p>
<p>These figures demonstrate the point that open access champions make about fostering a knowledge eco-system that enables re-use and re-imagining of knowledge, especially where its original purpose was to further human understanding.  As someone who people often come to when the time comes to deposit their thesis or research in OUR Archive, I can tell you that on a practical level all rights reserved copyright acts as a very real impediment to people choosing more open licences or even to allowing any sort of access to their work at all.  Often they need to remove parts that they have not been able to secure permission for and thereby reduce the effectiveness of their work.  I spoke to a PhD candidate just yesterday who had sought permission, heard nothing, and elected to remove graphs from his work for the OUR Archive version rather than keep trying.  This is particularly true of student researchers who lack the professional confidence of academic staff.  And if they do receive a response, a charge of $100 is enough to convince most students that they don’t really need to include that image in the on-line version.  Many times they could argue that their use was covered by fair dealing but even staff are very wary of the uncertainties of taking this approach.</p>
<p>Copyright fear – the vague but strong sense that I could be prosecuted for my use of someone else’s material: “I am just a lone researcher up against an organisation with (surely?) an army of legal advisors; there’s no-one here I can ask who will give me a straight answer (probably because they don’t really understand all the complexities themselves); and they are likely to be as afraid of giving me bad advice as I am of ‘risking it.’  Better to just play safe and forget about it.”  There are very few librarians or copyright officers who are legally qualified and it is therefore common for both these advisors and academic staff to err on the side of caution.  But I note here that I have only dealt with one formal complaint of copyright infringement in five years in this role.</p>
<p>Things are changing, though.  You can look at the question I asked our teaching staff about Creative Commons, turn the stats around, and say that over half do know something about it.  And there are a number of comments in the survey that indicate changes in practice, about staff becoming more aware of rights management in the light of technological changes in recent years.  There is even the odd evangelical comment bemoaning the barriers to advancing research and scholarship formed by subscription paywalls.  And we have a core collective of staff who are trying to spread the word, loosely organised around <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/openotago/">a blog</a> and a copyright community of practice.  But as the statistics I’ve provided suggest these are still to some extent lonely voices among the crowd.  To me this says that we –  in NZ at least – have some way to go before we can really say that the conversation has moved from ‘is it open access’ to ‘how open is it.’</p>
<p>And, turning my mind back to my own situation just 16 years ago, I wish someone had said to me at the outset of my research that I should be thinking about making my work available to the widest possible audience to read and re-use.  While theses have traditionally been regarded as unpublished works, I think we now do our research students a disservice if we breed this attitude into them.  This simply perpetuates the frustrations they suffer in trying to use material themselves.  As academics-in-training, we need to train them to think the way academics should – it’s just that we might need to convince more to think this way first.  Only then will the knowledge eco-system flourish and we can begin to shift the accent from open <em>access</em> to <em>open</em> access.</p>

<h5>By Penny Carnaby</h5>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>What's happening in scholarly publishing?</em></p>

<p>There has been considerable discussion of scholarly publishing in the media recently.</p>
<p>In the United States, the Research Works Act and the Federal Research Public Access Act cthat generated a storm of protest across the world, including a boycott of Elsevier journals. This debate was significant in succeeding to get the issues about Open Access Publishing debated on the international stage.</p>
<p>In Great Britain, the <a href="http://www.researchinfonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Finch-Group-report-FINAL-VERSION.pdf">Finch Report</a> expanded and deepened the debate on Open Access Publishing significantly. The report met with mixed reviews from Open Access proponents and the publishing industry. The greatest benefit of the report is that it brought the debate about ‘Green’ and ‘Gold’ Open Access to a much broader international audience. The likely funding and policy implications for research agencies was laid out clearly in this report but is, at this stage, unresolved.</p>
<p>In Australia, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has changed its policy position requiring NHMRC supported research to be deposited in <a href="http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/media/notices/2012/revised-policy-dissemination-research-findings">Open Access Research Repositories</a>. This initiative has prompted widespread discussion about Open Access Publishing in the Australian context.</p>
<p>There are many more examples: International events have brought the issues of Open Access Publishing into the spotlight and it is highly likely that the momentum towards Open Access Publishing will increase. There are clear signals of significant shifts in scholarly publishing conventions in New Zealand in the future.</p>
<p><em>What problems are we trying to address?</em></p>
<p>In essence, the conversation about scholarly publishing is trying to address several issues including:</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>better, faster, more affordable access to publicly funded research publications for everyone</li>

    <li>greater public access to research funded by the public purse</li>

    <li>the increasing disquiet that the process of scholarly communication has not really yet leveraged the potential, reach and scale of the internet</li>

    <li>the unacceptable and unaffordable escalating cost of research publishing and scholarly output, particularly relating to the larger science based aggregates and publishers</li>

    <li>understanding how we assess research impact, peer review processes and the integrity of the research process in an Open Access environment.</li>

</ol>
<p><em>What is open access?</em></p>
<p>While journals are now online, they are only available to people who pay a subscription or who are members of an institution who pays a subscription. Put simply open access uses digital technology to make research findings widely available. Researchers can make their work open access by one of two ways.</p>
<p>Publishing in an open access journal such as <em>PLoS One</em> is referred to as ‘gold’ open access. This may incur an article processing fee. While a few universities in Australia provide funds for open access publishing, the majority do not. Researchers may wish to consider including these fees in any grant proposals. Note that the 2012 ARC Discovery Grant funding rules allow 2% of the grant to be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Alternatively researchers can deposit a version of their work into a subject based repository such as arXiv.org, SSRN or RePEc, or an institutional repository. Every university in Australia and New Zealand has a repository for this purpose.</p>
<p><em>Doesn’t open access contravene copyright?</em></p>
<p>Generally the copyright of a paper is held by the author or the author’s institution prior to publication. The publisher’s agreement the author signs at the time of publication usually transfers the copyright of the work to the publisher. This then restricts use of the published work.</p>
<p>While putting the published version of a work into a repository (or onto Mendeley or Academia.edu) will contravene most publishers’ agreements, the majority of publishers allow an earlier version of a paper to be deposited into a repository.</p>
<p>The version most researchers make available is the accepted version – the final peer reviewed and corrected paper. This is sometimes called a post print. The Sherpa/RoMEO website (<a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/</a>) lists the policies for most publishers.</p>
<p lang="en-NZ"><em>What are the alternatives to copyright?</em></p>

<p>The Creative Commons (<a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/">http://creativecommons.org.au/</a>) is a set of internationally accepted licences which helps an organisation, author (or content) to share their work and indicate how they wish their work to be used. In New Zealand the government has adopted Creative Commons (see NZGOAL <a href="http://nzgoal.info/">http://nzgoal.info/</a>).</p>
<p>Alternatively there is an option for authors to amend their publisher’s agreement with an author addenda. There are online tools to generate these automatically (<a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/addendum.shtml">http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/addendum.shtml</a>)</p>
<p><em>What are the benefits of OA?</em></p>
<p>The pursuit of research is to increase global knowledge. Disseminating work through open access channels means that researchers in less resourced institutions, practitioners in the field and the general public can share findings. The taxpayer supports the research, the writing up of results, and the peer review and editing process. Open access allows these taxpayers to see these findings without having to pay to view.</p>
<p><em>What are some of the concerns with OA?</em></p>
<p>Some researchers express concern about plagiarism, particularly in terms of making theses available. However, while plagiarism occurs all the time, making work available in a repository clearly identifies the author as the owner of the work.</p>
<p>Publishers clearly have concerns that making work open access could affect subscriptions to their journals and threaten their viability. However, to date there is scant evidence that this will happen. The physics community has been making their work available through arXiv.org for over 20 years and this has not caused physics journals to fold.</p>
<p><em>How can universities support open access?</em></p>
<p>Universities can support the sharing of their researchers by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring the university has a robust open access policy</li>

    <li>Considering an open access mandate</li>

    <li>Educating researchers on the benefits of open access</li>

    <li>Raising awareness of scholarly communication issues amongst the academic and library staff</li>

    <li>Encouraging authors to use Creative Commons licenses or author addenda</li>

</ul>
<p><em>What does this mean in the New Zealand context?</em></p>
<p>At this stage in New Zealand we are not seeing the magnitude of change that is being observed in Europe, USA and Australia. Having said this, there are strong Central Government signals about Open Access in relation to government data and information that may well transfer to research funding generally before long.</p>

<p>With Open Access Week (October 22-28) around the corner, there's plenty of events taking place across the country. With moves towards open access to scholarly publishing taking place in the UK, the EU, USA and Australia, it seems like a good time to start thinking about what open access will look like closer to home.</p>
<p>To this end, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is hosting a series of posts on the theme of Open Access. Featuring contributions from academics, publishers and librarians, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/open_access_2012/">Open Access in Aotearoa</a> will discuss the future of free and open access to New Zealand’s publicly funded scholarly research.</p>
<p>Several New Zealand universities are also hosting their own Open Access activities.</p>

<h5>By Sigi Jöttkandt</h5>
<p>Happy open access week, everyone, and thanks, Matt, for the invitation to blog.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, Aidan Byrne, the Chief Executive of the <a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/default.htm">Australian Research Council</a> expressed strong support for open access in an <a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-australian-research-councils-new-leader-opens-up/40276">interview in </a><a href="https://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-australian-research-councils-new-leader-opens-up/40276"><em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em></a>. He said he intends to include the provision for open access in all future ARC-funded grant programmes, which will support and complement the existing open access mandate of Australia's <a href="http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/">National Heath and Medical Research Council</a>. This is very good news.</p>
<p>It also highlights the growing need for viable open access dissemination options, particularly in Humanities disciplines which are heavily reliant on the book form. Over the last couple of years, we've seen a lot of discussion about open access book publishing. Books are generally considered more challenging to make open access because of the high costs associated with their production, and few publishers seem willing to let authors self-archive whole books in institutional repositories. This is especially true if sales may still be forthcoming thanks to the longer shelf life of humanities scholarship.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions though. A new initiative, the <a href="http://www.doabooks.org/doab?func=about&amp;uiLanguage=en">Directory of Open Access Books</a> was launched this year (modeled along the lines of the existing <a href="http://www.doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>) to collate the metadata and to link to the full text of books published by open access publishers. Some of these publications are by established presses such as Palgrave Macmillan, the University of Amsterdam Press, the University of Michigan Press and others that are exploring open access with several of their book series (here's a link to the full list of <a href="http://www.doabooks.org/doab?func=publisher&amp;uiLanguage=en">participating publishers</a>). We've also seen the encouraging growth of new scholar-led open access presses that are using print on demand to overcome the steep start-up costs and hurdles associated with traditional printing. The Melbourne small press, <a href="http://re-press.org/">re.press</a>, is an example of an independent open access publisher in philosophy and literature that has found a way to combine rigorous peer review with open access and well-designed print versions. <a href="http://punctumbooks.com/category/titles/">Punctum Books</a>, based in New York, is a similar scholar-run model, as is <a href="http://www.openbookpublishers.com/">Open Book Publishers</a>, based in Cambridge, UK.</p>
<p>I predict we will see more of these kinds of scholar-led, independent niche presses servicing the specific needs of their disciplines emerging in tandem with the growing array of new technologies that make it easier for non-professionals to participate in publishing. The Canadian group, <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/">The Public Knowledge Project</a>, is launching a new open source book publishing platform, <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/omp">Open Monograph Press</a>, which is designed to lower the barrier to entry by managing and largely automating the workflow processes – much in the way their successful Open Journal Systems software did for journal publishing.</p>
<p><a href="http://openhumanitiespress.org/">Open Humanities Press</a> (OHP) is one of the “Early Adopters” trialling this new book publishing system. From the beginning of this year, OHP has begun publishing books, adopting the same model of a distributed network of international scholar editors and library partners that we use for our <a href="http://openhumanitiespress.org/cosmos-and-history.html">journals</a>. OHP currently has 5 <a href="http://openhumanitiespress.org/critical-climate-change.html">book series</a>, each edited and managed by members of OHP's editorial board. The production of the OA books is done by our library publishing partner, <a href="http://www.lib.umich.edu/mpublishing">Mpublishing</a>, at The University of Michigan Library, which also hosts, catalogs, archives and makes the print books available for sale through online distributors. By means of this partnership, we've published six born-digital open access books in philosophy and critical theory, and have just launched two more in celebration of Open Access Week: a collection of essays titled <a href="http://openhumanitiespress.org/terror-theory-and-the-humanities.html">Terror, Theory and the Humanitie</a>s, ed. Jeffrey R. DeLio and Uppinder Mehan, and <a href="http://openhumanitiespress.org/new-materialism.html">New Materialism</a> by Rick Dolphjin and Iris van der Tuin, with interviews by contemporary philosophers, Rosi Braidotti, Manuel DeLanda, Karen Barad, and Quentin Meillassoux.</p>
<p>Inquiries about OHP are welcome. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:info@openhumanitiespress.org">info@openhumanitiespress.org</a></p>
<p>Sigi Jöttkandt is a co-founder of <a href="http://openhumanitiespress.org/" target="_blank">Open Humanities Press</a>. She is author of several books on literature and philosophy, and teaches English at the University of New South Wales.</p>

<a href="posts/2012/10/11/ccanz-is-looking-for-interns.html" class="u-url">CCANZ Is Looking for Interns</a>
             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2012-10-11T12:05:29+13:00">2012-10-11 12:05</time>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p></p>
<h4>Who are you looking for?</h4>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) is looking for two paid interns to help out over the university holidays.</p>
<p>The first intern will be a talented designer or visual artist, keen to produce a range of CCANZ resources, including an A2 poster.</p>
<p>The second intern will be a confident and engaging writer from either law, the humanities or related disciplines, willing to develop a Creative Commons research guide, write blog posts and conduct interviews for a range of Creative Commons case studies.</p>
<p>Both interns will be energetic supporters of open licensing and open culture, capable of working both collaboratively and independently. While all students are encouraged to apply, the successful candidates are likely to be entering their fourth or fifth years of study.</p>
<h4>Where? When? And how much?<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cc.large_.png"><img class="wp-image-2249 alignright" title="cc.large" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cc.large_-300x300.png" alt="" width="160" height="160"></a>
</h4>

<p>Interns will be paid $15 per hour. The amount of paid hours available will depend on the result of our November crowd-funding campaign. Candidates should note that, should the crowd-funding campaign fail, CCANZ will no longer be in a position to offer paid internships. We hope, however, to provide a total of at least 75 hours paid work. Interns will not be expected to work for free, though there may be opportunities to volunteer after the duration of the internship.</p>
<p>Ideally, the successful candidates will work between fifteen and twenty hours per week, between 8.30am and 3pm, at the Thorndon home of the Royal Society of New Zealand. Both interns will work under the direct supervision of the Public Lead for CCANZ. The internship will run from January 10 to February 15 2013, though specific details will not be determined until early December.</p>
<p>The successful candidates will be temporary employees of the Royal Society of New Zealand, which hosts the CCANZ project. Regrettably, CCANZ is unable to provide accommodation in Wellington, and candidates should note that their pay is unlikely to cover living costs in the Wellington area.</p>
<h4>What’s Creative Commons?</h4>

<p>CCANZ is the kaitiaki of the Creative Commons licences in Aotearoa New Zealand. We promote openness across culture, education, science and government. Browse our website for more information about what we do.</p>
<h4>What will I be doing?</h4>

<p>On top of some basic administrative tasks, you’ll be working on a number of exciting Creative Commons projects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>designing an A2 Creative Commons poster;</li>

    <li>recording CCANZ presentations;</li>

    <li>developing a CC research guide, to encourage postgraduate student research;</li>

    <li>producing a bibliography of CC books and articles, to be shared on the Creative Commons wiki;</li>

    <li>writing blog posts on the CCANZ website;</li>

    <li>working with the CCANZ community;</li>

    <li>organising Creative Commons events;</li>

    <li>interviewing and writing case studies; and,</li>

    <li>sending out promotional material for our 2013 Creative Commons showcase for New Zealand school students.</li>

</ul>
<p>You’ll also be involved in discussions with the Public Lead on what Creative Commons might do in the future.</p>
<h4>How do I apply?</h4>

<p>To apply, email Matt McGregor at admin@creativecommons.org.nz</p>
<p>Design or arts applicants should provide a short CV and portfolio.</p>
<p>Law and humanities applicants should provide a short CV and cover letter.</p>
<p>Applications close <del>Friday October 26</del> midnight, Monday October 29.</p>

<p>As ever teacher knows, good teaching requires good teaching resources.  High quality lesson plans, articles, info sheets, activities, videos, posters, stories, games, quizzes and more allow teachers to dedicate their time and creativity to what matters most: their students.</p>
<p>In decades past, teachers would gather resources over the course of their career, often photocopying parts of textbooks and borrowing from more experienced teachers to create an idiosyncratic, hard-won archive of remixed materials. By adapting and remixing these copyright works, teachers could develop resources that suited both their students and their own teaching styles.</p>
<p>Teachers, then, have always shared, remixed and reused their resources. You could go so far as to say that teachers are the original Creative Commoners.</p>
<p>With digital technologies, these practices are becoming easier than ever; and with online repositories like <a href="http://wikieducator.org/New_Zealand" target="_blank">Wikieducator</a>, the potential pool of available resources becomes much, much larger. Instead of adapting materials from the handful of colleagues, teachers could enjoy the collective intelligence of the entire country. Instead of re-inventing lessons plans already created a thousand times over, teachers could adapt and remix their own--producing, in much less time, high quality resources, to be shared, remixed and reused in turn by thousands of other New Zealand educators.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Teachers-Training-College.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2220" title="Teachers Training College" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Teachers-Training-College-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230"></a> "Group Portrait of Teachers Training College," by Herman John Schmidt, 1910. <a href="http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?BU=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aucklandcity.govt.nz%2Fdbtw-wpd%2FHeritageImages%2Findex.htm&amp;AC=QBE_QUERY&amp;TN=heritageimages&amp;QF0=ID&amp;NP=2&amp;MR=5&amp;RF=HIORecordSearch&amp;QI0=%3D%2231-WP695%22">Sir George Grey Special Collections, Auckland Libraries, 31-WP695.</a> No known copyright.</p>
<p>Sounds good, doesn't it? The only problem for New Zealand teachers is<a href="http://www.copyright.org.nz/viewUserCat.php?category=217" target="_blank"> the risk of copyright violation</a>. While swapping photocopies in the staffroom is unlikely to draw the attention of copyright holders, online sharing of teaching resources is much more visible. Copyright violation even extends to those resources that teachers have made for themselves, which are in fact owned by their respective boards of trustees.</p>
<p>Happily, this isn't as dire as it sounds: Some New Zealand schools have chosen to address this issue by implementing<a title="Creative Commons for New Zealand Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/creative-commons-for-new-zealand-schools/" target="_blank"> their own Creative Commons policies</a>, which gives an automatic Creative Commons licence to all of the school's  teaching resources; many other New Zealand schools are taking the issue to their boards of trustees.</p>
<p>This sounds great in theory, but what about some examples of openly licensed educational resources? It's been a busy few months for OER, as schools, universities and governments across the world have started to embracing open licensing. Here are a few highlights:</p>
<p><strong>In California</strong>, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/california-takes-a-big-step-forward-free-digital-open-source-textbooks/263047/" target="_blank">giving students free online access to 50 undergraduate textbooks</a>. By law, these new textbooks much be provided under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p><strong>In Queensland<em>,</em></strong><em> </em>the University of Queensland has decided to follow the example of MIT and <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?article=25297" target="_blank">develop a major online learning environment</a>. Over the next few years, they will roll out Massive Open Onlines Courses (MOOCs) in several disciplines.</p>
<p><strong>In Paris</strong>, over 400 representatives of countries and institutions from around the world <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/events/calendar-of-events/events-websites/World-Open-Educational-Resources-Congress" target="_blank">signed UNESCO's OER declaration</a>, calling on governments to adopt and promote OERs.</p>
<p><strong>In the USA,</strong> <a href="posts/2012/10/10/to%20determine%20how%20open%20educational%20resources%20(OER)%20can%20support%20the%20success%20of%20girls%20and%20women%20in%20science,%20technology,%20engineering%20and%20math%20(STEM)%20in%20support%20of%20the%20Equal%20Futures%20Partnership,%20announced%20on%20September%2024%20by%20U.S.%20Secretary%20of%20State%20Hillary%20Clinton." target="_blank">Creative Commons and the Open Courseware Consortium have launched a task force</a>, to see how OERs "can support the "success of girls and women in science, technology, engineering and math," supporting <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/24/fact-sheet-equal-futures-partnership-expand-women-s-political-and-econom" target="_blank">the WhiteHouse's Equal Futures Partnership</a> with twelve other countries.</p>
<p><strong>Also in the USA</strong>, the Obama administration announced in 2011 <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/26100" target="_blank">a $2 billion fund to create open educational resources</a>--all of which must be licensed Creative Commons Attribution.</p>
<p><strong>Also in Queensland<em>,</em></strong><em> </em>the University of Southern Queensland is rolling out <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" target="_blank">its own Creative Commons licensed wikieducator course--for full academic credit</a>. The course is a prototype for the development of the Open Educational Resources University (OERu).</p>
<p><strong>Closer to home, </strong>Wikieducator is running another <a href="http://http://wikieducator.org/Open_content_licensing_for_educators/Home" target="_blank">Open Content Licensing for Educators Workshop in December 2012</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In Wellington<em>,</em></strong><em> </em>Wikieducator will be running <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Nzopened" target="_blank">a national symposium on open education, scheduled for November 8 2012</a>. The symposium will aim for a "sector-wide response to open education in New Zealand."</p>
