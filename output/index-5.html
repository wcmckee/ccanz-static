<p>"Open content licensing for educators" is a free <strong>online</strong> workshop held from <strong>23rd - 27th January 2012</strong>. It is designed for educators who want to learn more about open education resources, copyright, and creative commons licences.</p>
<p>The course materials were developed as a collaborative project by volunteers from the OER Foundation, WikiEducator, the OpenCourseWare Consortium and Creative Commons with funding support from UNESCO. The course will provide prerequisite knowledge required by educators to legally remix open education materials and help institutions to take informed decisions about open content licences.</p>
<p><a href="http://wikieducator.org/Open_content_licensing_for_educators/About" target="_self">Registration is open</a>.</p>
<p>Participants will need approximately 1 hour for each day of the workshop at a time which suits your own schedule.</p>

<a href="posts/2011/11/08/beethovens-open-repository-of-research.html" class="u-url">Beethoven's Open Repository of Research</a>
             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2011-11-08T08:05:58+13:00">2011-11-08 08:05</time>

<p>According to Beethoven "There should be only one repository of art in the world, to which the artist would donate his works in order to take what he would need". Scientist and open access advocate <a href="https://plus.google.com/114065345396177138533/posts" target="_self">Daniel Mietchen</a> has teamed up with University of Auckland's <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/Kubke" target="_self">Fabiana Kubke</a> to plan for a <a href="http://rockethub.com/projects/3755-beethoven-s-open-repository-of-research" target="_self">living research repository in the spirit of Beethoven's vision</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What if the public scientific record would be updated directly as research proceeds?</strong></p>
<p>This initiative aims to convert existing CC licensed scholarly articles and present them in linked and editable formats. Objects in the repository could be updated and reviewed as new research emerges, and the public version history of the platform stands as a transparent record of changes over time.</p>
<p>Rationale for 'open science' is the rapid and efficient communication of research, which in turn enables more targeted collaboration and a better understanding of where the frontiers of knowledge actually are.</p>
<p>The ability to legally build on existing ideas here is made feasible by the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution licence</a> attached to works, as is the case with most scholarly articles published in Open Access journals. Anyone will be free to adapt the copyright materials in the repository as long as Attribution is given. This goes a step further than many open access projects which simply allow access to research but do not license for reuse.</p>
<p>[vimeo 30046678 w=500 h=393]</p>
<p>"Within the Open Access movement, the focus so far was on getting access to the research literature, with little thought going into potential reuses of OA materials beyond access for reading." says Mietchen. "With this project, we are trying to make it easier to stay on top of the research literature by updating, enriching and expanding published articles that are available under a Creative Commons Attribution Licence."</p>
<p>Beethoven's open repository of research is being <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:OpenScientist/Open_grant_writing/Encyclopaedia_of_original_research" target="_self">transparently developed on Wikiversity</a> and GitHub - both collaboratively editable platforms. The concept is now being put to public review by way of RocketHub - a launchpad space for independent creators to showcase work, crowdsource ideas and garner financial support from interested communities - as part of the <a href="https://scifund.wordpress.com/" target="_self">SciFund Challenge</a> aimed at testing the potential of crowdfunding for research. <a href="http://rockethub.com/projects/3755-beethoven-s-open-repository-of-research" target="_self">Check out the project page</a> where you can contribute suggestions, questions and even monetary support. Or take a look at the <a href="http://www.rockethub.com/projects/scifund" target="_self">48 other projects participating</a> in the challenge, some of which also have open components beyond the public proposal.</p>

<p><em>The 2011 Creative Commons Annual Campaign is officially on. This campaign is important for Creative Commons as a global network (and ultimately for CC in NZ) and we encourage Aotearoa supporters to get involved.</em></p>
<h3>Creative Commons says</h3>

<p>Please <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">join us</a> in powering the future of openness!</p>
<p>This year, we are offering a limited teal edition of the CC “I love to share” t-shirt to everyone who <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">donates</a> $50 or more (until supplies run out). For those who <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">donate</a> $300 or more, in addition to the t-shirt, we are offering beautiful hard copy editions of <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">The Power of Open</a>, stories of creators sharing knowledge, art, and data using Creative Commons.</p>
<p>The world is experiencing an explosion of openness. From artists inviting creative collaboration to governments around the world requiring publicly funded works be available to everyone, the spirit and practice of sharing is gaining momentum and producing results. We <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">post</a> about these results frequently; subscribe to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/newsletter?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">CC newsletter</a> for a distilled monthly rundown.</p>
<p>Creative Commons relies on donations to build and constantly improve the technical and legal tools that enable openness to flourish. The future of openness is bright, but ensuring that future requires urgent and sustained effort. CC is continuing to improve the usefulness of our licenses and helping even more artists, institutions and governments share their works. We are reaching a critical mass and need <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">your support</a> now more than ever.</p>

<p>Open Access - the free, immediate, online access to the results of scholarly research, and the right to use and re-use those results as you need.</p>
<p>Open Access Week is global celebration of Open Access to scholarship and research. Institutions use this week as a designated opportunity to learn about and promote the benefits of Open Access, and help make it the new norm of practice.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons infrastructure underpins many open access initiatives by providing copyright licences which researchers and scholars can use to allow re-use of their work.</p>

<p><strong>Open Access for Climate Scientists 2011</strong></p>
<p>26 October 2011, DTU-Aqua, Copenhagen</p>
<p>Global Climate Change (GCC) research and related disciplines, focused on consequences and mitigation, are targeting humanity's "biggest challenge for the 21st century". The majority of that research is publicly funded, but currently it is not freely accessible to society and relevant stakeholders. Open Access provides the legal framework and e-infrastructures nested within universities to provide 100% free and immediate access to all future GCC-related, peer-reviewed research. The training is designed for all authors of peer-reviewed research, and will demonstrate the available means to achieve 100% open access, while boosting their own impact and citations. Visit <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/events/open-access-for-climate" target="_self">Open Access for Climate Scientists.</a></p>

<p>Some of our CC affiliates in Asia are hosting a poster design competition for the summit, based on the theme, “Powering an Open Future.”</p>
<p>From the website:</p>
<p><em>The Creative Commons Global Summit 2011 provides an opportunity for volunteers, industry leaders and practitioners of the worldwide open content licensing movement to explore and showcase the past, present and future of Creative Commons, copyright and free culture. It will be an event focused on sharing, openness and collaboration, with an eye towards setting the path for the Creative Commons community over its next 10 years.</em></p>
<p>The winning designs (judged by an international panel and by popular vote) will be introduced at the Global Summit with people in attendance from all over the world, featured prominently at the venue and also as part of a CC visual arts exhibit. The designer will receive a gift of the printed poster from a professional publishing company in Warsaw.</p>

<p>The Ministers of Finance and Internal Affairs have released a <a href="http://business.scoop.co.nz/2011/08/15/open-data-will-benefit-public-economy-english/" target="_self">statement</a> today detailing a new Declaration on Open and Transparent Government.</p>
<p><em>“Today the Government is releasing a declaration that clearly sets out our expectation that agencies should release all non-personal and unclassified data with high potential value for re-use,” </em>says Finance Minister Bill English<em>.</em></p>
<p>Included in the full <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/declaration-open-and-transparent-government" target="_self">Declaration on Open and Transparent Government statement</a>, is the notion that "The government holds data on behalf of the New Zealand public. We release it to enable the private and community sectors to use it to grow the economy, strengthen our social and cultural fabric, and sustain our environment. We release it to encourage business and community involvement in government decision-making."</p>
<p>The utility of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences_explained__1" target="_self">New Zealand Creative Commons licences</a> for legally reusable materials is detailed in the <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework (NZGOAL)</a>. The framework acts as guidance for agencies when opening up content and data for reuse. In particular, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_self">Attribution licence</a> is recommended as the default licence when releasing material in this way.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/new-zealand-data-and-information-management-princi" target="_self">New Zealand Data and Information Management Principles</a> have also been approved to ensure high quality management of the information the government holds on the behalf of the public.</p>
<p>One such Principal is that materials should be 'Reusable':</p>
<p><em>Data and information released can be discovered, shared, used and reused over time and through technology change. Copyright works are licensed for reuse and open access to and reuse of non-copyright materials is enabled, in accordance with the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework.</em></p>
<p><em>Data and information are released:</em></p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;</span>at source, with the highest possible level of granularity<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;</span>in re-usable, machine-readable format<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;</span>with appropriate metadata; and<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;</span>in aggregate or modified forms if they cannot be released in their original state.<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
