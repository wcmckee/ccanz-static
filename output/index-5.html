<p>The New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) has launched a competition for Year 9 - 13 secondary students and NZ schools to use creative remix or data mashup as a way to explore the theme of road safety.</p>
<p><a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/competitions/the-nzta-remix-competition-safer-journeys-for-teens" target="_self">The NZTA Remix Competition</a> has two parts. The first is to create an infographic, mashup, creative remix, or a literature remix (based on the works of Shakespeare) using content and data from NZTA websites and publications. The second part is to present or engage with students at your school with the entry you have made, and provide evidence of having undertaken this.</p>
<p>Entries will open on September 1st 2012 and close on October 31st 2012.</p>
<p>It's important to think about copyright when remixing the work of others. Students and teachers need to be sure that a creator is happy for their work to be used, and if so, they need to think about the conditions under which they may be allowed to use it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/competitions/the-nzta-remix-competition-safer-journeys-for-teens" target="_self">terms and conditions</a> of the competition ask you to respect the copyright of others. <em>"All content other than NZTA assets must be produced by the students themselves (by creating original audio, video or images) or by using remixable assets that are, in the public domain, openly licensed or with written permission of the originator."</em></p>
<p>Videos, images and music licensed under Creative Commons (or rather, Creative Commons materials that do not prohibit derivative works) are 'openly licensed' resources and are perfect for remix. The creators have already given permission for their works to be reused, as long as entrants follow the terms of their CC licence.</p>
<p>Schools entering will need to make sure they <strong>attribute</strong>, or give credit, to each work they use in their remix - as required by each of the CC licences. Here are some <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking/Users" target="_self">useful tips</a> for how to attribute well.</p>
<p>See our <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences_explained__1" target="_self">Licences Explained</a> to find out more about the others terms a CC licence might set out for you.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Where to find content?</h4>
<p>The competition's <a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/competitions/the-nzta-remix-competition-safer-journeys-for-teens" target="_self">Remixable Resources</a> page sets out some useful places to find suitable CC licensed materials. Remember that you can also find some great images that are in the public domain (without copyright). Try <a href="http://www.flickr.com/commons/" target="_self">The Commons</a> collection on Flickr for old pictures from around the world. A <a href="http://digitalnz.org/records?i%5Bformat%5D=Images&amp;i%5Brights%5D=Modify&amp;text=car" target="_self">DigitalNZ search</a> will also help you find NZ public domain and CC materials. Need sound effects? Go to <a href="http://www.freesound.org/browse/tags/car/" target="_self">FreeSound</a> for CC licensed tracks like <a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/cognito%20perceptu/sounds/17924/" target="_self">urban traffic noises</a> and <a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/guitarguy1985/sounds/54086/" target="_self">car horns</a>.</p>

<p>Teachers, technologists and institutions around the world are celebrating open educational resources (OERs) for <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_self">Open Education Week</a>.</p>
<p>OERs are learning materials that can be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" target="_self">freely shared and reused by anyone</a>. Creative Commons licences, when applied to teaching materials, help creators release their work for the public to enjoy and benefit from. Those same creators can also pick up someone else's Creative Commons licensed work to make their own outputs richer, more colorful or better informed.</p>
<p>The ability to bring in and and adapt high quality materials for new learning resources is vital in our digital information age. Finding pictures and videos to post on teaching blogs, reproducing chapters and articles, the ability to translate information into any language - each of these freedoms people want to enjoy legally are enabled by the OER movement.</p>
<p><strong>Open Access Week runs from March 5th - 10th</strong> and is designed to inform people about OERs and promote their value to a global learning environment. There will be webinars open to participation from anyone, virtual tours, pre-recorded presentations, documents and discussion opportunities.</p>
<p>Keep an eye of the <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_self">Open Education Week website</a> for information about upcoming events.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cckorea.org/xe/?mid=english" target="_self">Creative Commons Korea</a> project has released an attractive new content search tool - making it easy to source Creative Commons licensed materials.</p>
<p>The "<a href="http://eng.letscc.net/" target="_self">Let's CC</a>" website brings you relevant results from pools such as Flickr, Foopedia, Clipart, Freesound, Slideshare and more. Simply type in a search term and filter for how many freedoms the copyright owner has granted you with their Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>"Let's CC" was originally created for a Korean audience, so we're thrilled that Kiwi's can enjoy it in its English language version. Other CC content searches can be made through global CC's own <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_self">search interface</a> and through <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_self">DigitalNZ</a> for New Zealand results.</p>

<p>According to Beethoven "There should be only one repository of art in the world, to which the artist would donate his works in order to take what he would need". Scientist and open access advocate <a href="https://plus.google.com/114065345396177138533/posts" target="_self">Daniel Mietchen</a> has teamed up with University of Auckland's <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/Kubke" target="_self">Fabiana Kubke</a> to plan for a <a href="http://rockethub.com/projects/3755-beethoven-s-open-repository-of-research" target="_self">living research repository in the spirit of Beethoven's vision</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What if the public scientific record would be updated directly as research proceeds?</strong></p>
<p>This initiative aims to convert existing CC licensed scholarly articles and present them in linked and editable formats. Objects in the repository could be updated and reviewed as new research emerges, and the public version history of the platform stands as a transparent record of changes over time.</p>
<p>Rationale for 'open science' is the rapid and efficient communication of research, which in turn enables more targeted collaboration and a better understanding of where the frontiers of knowledge actually are.</p>
<p>The ability to legally build on existing ideas here is made feasible by the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution licence</a> attached to works, as is the case with most scholarly articles published in Open Access journals. Anyone will be free to adapt the copyright materials in the repository as long as Attribution is given. This goes a step further than many open access projects which simply allow access to research but do not license for reuse.</p>
<p>[vimeo 30046678 w=500 h=393]</p>
<p>"Within the Open Access movement, the focus so far was on getting access to the research literature, with little thought going into potential reuses of OA materials beyond access for reading." says Mietchen. "With this project, we are trying to make it easier to stay on top of the research literature by updating, enriching and expanding published articles that are available under a Creative Commons Attribution Licence."</p>
<p>Beethoven's open repository of research is being <a href="http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:OpenScientist/Open_grant_writing/Encyclopaedia_of_original_research" target="_self">transparently developed on Wikiversity</a> and GitHub - both collaboratively editable platforms. The concept is now being put to public review by way of RocketHub - a launchpad space for independent creators to showcase work, crowdsource ideas and garner financial support from interested communities - as part of the <a href="https://scifund.wordpress.com/" target="_self">SciFund Challenge</a> aimed at testing the potential of crowdfunding for research. <a href="http://rockethub.com/projects/3755-beethoven-s-open-repository-of-research" target="_self">Check out the project page</a> where you can contribute suggestions, questions and even monetary support. Or take a look at the <a href="http://www.rockethub.com/projects/scifund" target="_self">48 other projects participating</a> in the challenge, some of which also have open components beyond the public proposal.</p>

<p><em>The 2011 Creative Commons Annual Campaign is officially on. This campaign is important for Creative Commons as a global network (and ultimately for CC in NZ) and we encourage Aotearoa supporters to get involved.</em></p>
<h3>Creative Commons says</h3>

<p>Please <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">join us</a> in powering the future of openness!</p>
<p>This year, we are offering a limited teal edition of the CC “I love to share” t-shirt to everyone who <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">donates</a> $50 or more (until supplies run out). For those who <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">donate</a> $300 or more, in addition to the t-shirt, we are offering beautiful hard copy editions of <a href="http://thepowerofopen.org/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">The Power of Open</a>, stories of creators sharing knowledge, art, and data using Creative Commons.</p>
<p>The world is experiencing an explosion of openness. From artists inviting creative collaboration to governments around the world requiring publicly funded works be available to everyone, the spirit and practice of sharing is gaining momentum and producing results. We <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">post</a> about these results frequently; subscribe to the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/newsletter?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">CC newsletter</a> for a distilled monthly rundown.</p>
<p>Creative Commons relies on donations to build and constantly improve the technical and legal tools that enable openness to flourish. The future of openness is bright, but ensuring that future requires urgent and sustained effort. CC is continuing to improve the usefulness of our licenses and helping even more artists, institutions and governments share their works. We are reaching a critical mass and need <a href="https://creativecommons.net/donate/?utm_campaign=fall2011&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=launchannouncement" target="_self">your support</a> now more than ever.</p>

<p><strong>Open Access for Climate Scientists 2011</strong></p>
<p>26 October 2011, DTU-Aqua, Copenhagen</p>
<p>Global Climate Change (GCC) research and related disciplines, focused on consequences and mitigation, are targeting humanity's "biggest challenge for the 21st century". The majority of that research is publicly funded, but currently it is not freely accessible to society and relevant stakeholders. Open Access provides the legal framework and e-infrastructures nested within universities to provide 100% free and immediate access to all future GCC-related, peer-reviewed research. The training is designed for all authors of peer-reviewed research, and will demonstrate the available means to achieve 100% open access, while boosting their own impact and citations. Visit <a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/events/open-access-for-climate" target="_self">Open Access for Climate Scientists.</a></p>
<p><strong>Noon Hour Webcasts at Athabasca University </strong></p>

<p>Registration is now open for the 2011 Creative Commons Global Summit in Warsaw, Poland, 16-18 September.</p>
<h3>The Conference</h3>

<p><em>From <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011" target="_self">Creative Commons ...</a></em></p>
<p>For three days in September 2011, the Creative Commons Global Summit will bring together the CC community in Warsaw, Poland, to engage strategically on the future of our shared commons, to renew and further build CC’s vital community, to collaborate on mutual projects and initiatives, and to celebrate our successes as we head towards the end of our first decade together.</p>
<p>CC HQ and meeting host, CC Poland, are still working on preparing the final agenda for the meeting, but a <a title="Summit 2011 overview" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Summit_2011_overview" target="_self">preliminary program</a> is now available.</p>
<p>The Global Summit will bring together members of CC's <a title="CC Affiliate Network" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network" target="_self">Affiliate Network</a> worldwide, CC board and staff, key stakeholders and many others interested in the present and future of the commons. It will include regional meetings, plenary sessions, legal-focused sessions, community-focused sessions, workshops, regional planning sessions and special discussion sessions on key issues such as key adoption areas, data, public domain and the new version 4.0 licenses. The meeting will also include a "public day", featuring sessions of most interest to members of the public, including case study showcases, sessions on CC use in areas such as education, government and science, and a CC Salon featuring local and international CC creations.</p>
<p>In addition, CC’s <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/board" target="_self">Board of Directors</a> will have a board meeting in Warsaw and will be available to meet with Affiliates.</p>

<h3>The Poster Competition</h3>

<p><em>From </em><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28608" target="_self"><em>Creative Commons ...</em></a></p>
<p>Some of our CC affiliates in Asia are hosting a poster design competition for the summit, based on the theme, “Powering an Open Future.”</p>
<p>From the website:</p>
<p><em>The Creative Commons Global Summit 2011 provides an opportunity for volunteers, industry leaders and practitioners of the worldwide open content licensing movement to explore and showcase the past, present and future of Creative Commons, copyright and free culture. It will be an event focused on sharing, openness and collaboration, with an eye towards setting the path for the Creative Commons community over its next 10 years.</em></p>
<p>The winning designs (judged by an international panel and by popular vote) will be introduced at the Global Summit with people in attendance from all over the world, featured prominently at the venue and also as part of a CC visual arts exhibit. The designer will receive a gift of the printed poster from a professional publishing company in Warsaw.</p>
<p>All submissions must be licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY</a> license and incorporate the CC Global Summit logo (see above for what that looks like). For the complete submission rules and to enter, visit the <a href="http://www.loftwork.com/blog/pickup/ccsummit2011-poster/?lang=en_US" target="_self">competition site</a>. (In the case you are not fluent in Japanese, you can change the language to English in the upper right hand corner.)</p>
<p>The deadline is August 22, so we look forward to seeing your creativity in action!</p>
