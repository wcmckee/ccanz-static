<p>On Friday 15 May, Matt is heading south to Invercargill. Thanks to SLANZA, we've managed to organise four back-to-back workshops on the day, which will all take place in the Invercargill Public Library Meeting Room.</p>
<p>If you're keen to attend any or all of these free workshops, please email Kirsty: kadam@jameshargest.school.nz</p>
<p></p>
<h4>9.30-10.30am: Creative Commons for the GLAM sector</h4>
<p>In 2014, both the National Library of New Zealand and Te Papa made significant commitments to release digitised collection items for reuse, under either a Creative Commons licence or a clear ‘no known rights’ statement. In this session, we’ll discuss the ins and outs of open access and open licensing for publicly-housed heritage collections, and talk about practical steps local institutions can take to make their collections more open.</p>
<h4>11-12pm: Creative Commons for research and tertiary education</h4>

<p>Around the world, tertiary education institutions are facing a crisis of affordability. On the one hand, the subscription costs for serials rose 402% between 1986 and 2011, a trend which led Harvard University to declare such increases “fiscally unsustainable.” On the other hand, the costs of student textbooks rose 812% from 1978-2012, increases which have had detrimental effects on both student debt and educational outcomes.</p>
<p>In this session, we’ll discuss how many institutions and funders are adopting policies on open access to research and open educational resources, to ensure that all publicly funded research outputs and educational resources are freely available to access and reuse.</p>
<h4>12.30-1.30pm: Creative Commons for schools</h4>

<p>Ever wondered how to share, adapt and reuse free and open educational resources online, without asking permission or breaking the law? Matt from Creative Commons will show you how.</p>
<p>After giving a quick introduction to copyright, Matt will discuss ins and outs of the free Creative Commons licences, and point to the adoption of a Creative Commons policy by over one hundred New Zealand schools. These policies make it legal for teachers to share resources owned by the Board of Trustees under a Creative Commons licence, so that they can be adapted and reused by others. Matt will also demonstrate how to search for more than 880 million works already available for free under a Creative Commons licence, including research, data, music, images and film.</p>
<h4>2-3pm: Creative Commons for Boards and School Leaders</h4>

<p>With the rise of new sharing portals, such as the Network for Learning’s Pond, more New Zealand teachers are going to be sharing teaching resources online. This is a great development. However, as teachers share more openly, schools will need to take greater care regarding their copyright policies, to ensure that teachers know exactly what they can and cannot do with works created during the course of their employment.</p>
<p>In this session, Matt from Creative Commons will provide an overview to copyright in schools, and show how over one hundred schools have used free Creative Commons licensing policies to provide greater certainty to teachers, school leaders and Boards of Trustees on the use and reuse of copyright works. Matt will also provide and walk through a template Creative Commons copyright policy, and discuss how a CC policy might be implemented with teaching staff.</p>

<b><h5>By Matt McGregor</h5></b>
<p>Last week, we went on the road with Billy Meinke, now with the University of Hawaii and formerly of Creative Commons International. Billy was in the country for the Open Source // Open Society conference (which you can read more about <a title="Education: a commons-based future" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/education-a-commons-based-future/">here</a>). We used Billy's arrival as an excuse to organise events promoting open textbooks in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, beginning in Auckland on 13 April.</p>
<p>Each event took a similar structure. First, Fabiana Kubke or I introduced Creative Commons, and outlined what Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand wanted to see in the sector. Next, Billy talked about some of the open education projects he's been involved in, including the $2billion TAACCCT project to develop open workplace training resources. Finally, Erika Pearson, Simon Hart and Richard White from the University of Otago talked about the Media Text Hack, a successful project to develop an open educational resource -- in a weekend.</p>

<p>Erika, Richard and Simon didn't use slides, <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/texthack/hackpack" target="_blank">but have handily put together the Hack Pack</a>, a one-stop shop for all things Media Text Hack related, including a ‘how to’ guide, discussions and reflections, and sample plans/documents for running your own open textbook hack.</p>

<b><h5>By Billy Meinke</h5></b>
<p><em>The following is an edited excerpt of a transcript from the talk Billy Meinke gave at the Open Source Open Society conference in Wellington in April 2015. Meinke is an educational technologist with College of Education at the University of Hawaii, and was formerly on the education team at Creative Commons international HQ.</em></p>
<p>Digital content is non-rivalrous, meaning that I can take something I have and give it to you, without losing anything myself. You see it all over the place on the internet, memes being shared and remixed and shared again. It’s collective creativity on a massive scale, but the law hasn’t adapted to suit the affordances of the digital world.</p>
<p>Ever-increasingly restrictive copyright laws have been introduced over the last few decades, extending the default length of time it takes for works to enter the public domain automatically. When you create a work in the United States, we’ll be waiting 70 years or more after your death until we can freely reuse your work. [50 years in NZ.] Does that sound reasonable in a digital age? In an age where the marginal cost of copying and transmitting digital artifacts is mere fractions of a penny? I think not.</p>
<p>Copyright (and patents) were originally designed to last a period of time long enough to incentivise the creation of new works. But several times during the 20th century, the default copyright term was exended after big media firms won cases to further lock away the likes of Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and the Happy Birthday song.</p>
<p>You made it; now you should be able to exploit it. What if we wanted to share it out? What if we wanted to build things with people who have shared interests, but live across the globe? What if we wanted to set our works free, or contribute to something larger than ourselves? Open licenses for content and code are at the ready and have allowed us to put our collective creativity into the commons how and when we wish to. The Creative Commons, the GNU Public Licence, and others have been critical in allowing this to happen.</p>
<p>The good news is, we are making headway together.</p>
<p>While there are real threats to this (such as the Trans Pacific Partnership), we’re actually sitting on the most robust commons we’ve ever had. Countless free and open-source software projects provides technical infrastructure that we rely on every day. Content and code and data are being put into the commons at a rate that should make every single one of us smile.</p>
<p><strong>In a commons-based future, educational opportunity is ubiquitous.</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who wants to learn can learn. The only barrier to education is the willingness to try. And when you try, you have a pool of shared knowledge at your fingertips that we could have only dreamt of in the past. You don’t think in terms of a textbook, because the web is your learning platform, and <em>you</em> own your educational future. And when you want to know more, you’re connected to other citizens who share your thirst for knowledge. You begin to string together digital artifacts along your journey, and you can see how others navigated the seas of open educational resources before you. You create your own pathways that others can follow after you move on. You participate in the commons.</p>
<p><strong>Arts and culture.</strong> You have the world’s cultural heritage available to you. You search the archives of thousands of museums in hundreds of countries, and help curate collections of millions of images and sounds and videos that tell the story of <em>our</em> world before now. You can see streams of artifacts flowing into the commons as new discoveries are unearthed. You can walk the halls of the Louvre or the Smithsonian or any number of places anywhere on earth that you’ve always wished to see. When you find something truly compelling, you take a 3D scan of it and print it at the local library. You place your hands on history, work with it, play with it, understand it. You make new things from the things of ages past. You breathe life into history. You participate in the commons.</p>
<p><strong>Research and science.</strong> You stand on the shoulders of giants and tap into a distributed body of research that spans all domains of science. You have access to the latest studies and reports, and to the underlying data and code that produced them. You can ask questions of the data that no one thought to do, or was able to before it was free. You make visualisations from it that help others find meaning in it. You thumb through sciencific studies being done all over the world in real-time. You can be a part of a community of enthusiasts who push the limits of what it means to be a citizen scientist. Science, for you, is a living breathing thing, and you’re participating in the commons.</p>
<p><strong>Government</strong> operates openly, bringing a heightened level of transparency and efficiency. Civic data is a few keystrokes away, and the government invites you to make the data more useful and consumable. Legislation is codified and publicly versioned, and you’re notified when a change is proposed or made to the laws you care the most about. Citizens are more informed and involved in the ways their tax dollars are spent, and they support government leaders who work to ensure this transparency continues in perpetuity. You have knowledge about your community and your world in the palm of your hand. You’re participating in the commons.</p>
<p>This commons-based future isn’t a fantasy, as you may have begun to think. Every one of the advantages and capabilities and freedoms I have mentioned are based on technology we have today. And each of them is happening somewhere in the world, but none of them are happening everywhere in the world. By participating in the commons, we can work towards a future where more people have a life that involves the commons. The commons can grow.</p>

<h5><strong>BY MATT MCGREGOR</strong></h5>
<p>Wayne Mackintosh is the Director of the <a title="OERF" href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resource Foundation</a> (OERF), an international non-profit organisation based in Dunedin. The OERF aims to promote the development and use of Open Educational Resources (OER) as a sustainable and renewable resource. Wayne also holds the UNESCO/COL/ICDE Chair in OER based at Otago Polytechnic and the Foundation.</p>
<p>I caught up with Wayne and began by asking about how he entered the world of Open Educational Resources.</p>
<p>“I spent the majority of my academic career working in open distance learning, including the University of South Africa, the biggest provider of distance learning in Africa. In 2002, I moved to New Zealand to help set up a distance and flexible learning centre at the University of Auckland. The idea behind the centre was to promote collaboration in elearning.”</p>
<p><b>What was the state of open education in 2001?</b></p>
<p>“It’s important to point out that ‘open education’ is an umbrella term. When we talk about open education, we’re talking about not only open educational resources, but also open source software, open governance, open policy.</p>
<p>“But in 2001, open education was virtually unheard of, and there was very little happening in terms of OER development. The concept itself wasn’t coined until a conference hosted by UNESCO in 2002. This is ironic, of course, as teaching is all about sharing knowledge freely -- it’s fundamental to what teachers do.</p>
<p>“In those days, we focused on the development and adoption of open source software, as this was considered the best way to introduce the concept of open education to the tertiary sector in New Zealand. Thanks to significant investment in that area from the government of the day, we were able to assist with the development of the open source learning management system Moodle.</p>
<p>“Partly as a result of that work, New Zealand has the highest rates of adoption of Moodle in the world.”</p>
<p><b>How did OER develop over the decade?</b></p>
<p>“For the first decade, the focus of the movement  was on advocacy -- just getting the message out and educating folks about open education. As the advocacy efforts developed, the donor community began to fund OER development. The William and Flora Hewitt Foundation in particular has funded a number of the OER projects, including projects like the open courseware initiative from MIT.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing the fruits of some of that early development now, with the adoption of open policy for major projects like the $2billion TAACCCT fund for educational resources for community colleges.”</p>
<p><b>What happened after leaving the University of Auckland? How did you get from there to the OERF?</b></p>
<p>“After the University of Auckland, I moved to represent New Zealand at the <a title="Commonwealth of Learning" href="http://www.col.org/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Commonwealth of Learning</a>, based in Vancouver, where my work focused on the adoption of open educational practices and open source software in education.</p>
<p>“After leaving the COL, I moved to set up the Open Education Resource Foundation. After looking around the world, I saw that the only higher education institution with an open policy for educational resources was <a title="Otago Polytech IP policy" href="http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic:_An_IP_policy_for_the_times" target="_blank">Otago Polytechnic</a> -- which is how the OERF came to be based in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“Happily, the Council of Otago Polytechnic were brave and forward-thinking enough to take us on.”</p>
<p><b>What does the OERF do?</b></p>
<p>"The OERF has two flagship initiatives. The first is <a title="Wikieducator" href="http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikieducator</a>, which is a platform for the global education community to share and edit educational resources with 58,000 registered account holders.</p>
<p>"The second is the OERu, which is a consortium of higher education institutions committed to providing truly free and open education, including open courses using only open educational resources.</p>
<p>"The mission of the OERu is to develop a sustainable ecosystem of open educational resources. All partner institutions commit to produce two free courses based entirely on OER, providing free access to all learners. Assessment services are then provided on a cost-recovery model. This model enables us to reduce the costs of tuition to the learner to as little as 20% of current costs."</p>
<p><b>What’s next? What does the future of OER look like?</b></p>
<p>"There’s still a long way to go. From my perspective, OER is inevitable -- no model of knowledge production can match the efficiency of OER. The real challenge, though, is how long it takes for institutions to develop a culture of sharing. Working for cultural change within traditional and conservative institutions -- as higher education institutions tend to be -- takes time.</p>
<p>"It’s important that we keep working to develop skills within the tertiary sector. This is still relatively little knowledge or expertise in OER, and this will need to change in order to make OER development and use mainstream.</p>
<p>"From a policy level, we need a stronger commitment from central government and tertiary education institutions to ensure that all educational resources produced by publicly funded institutions are made openly available. People often ask about the ‘sustainability’ of OER. It’s not rocket science: we already fund the production of open educational resources. We just need to make sure the resources that are already produced within universities are made available as OER using Creative Commons licences."</p>
<p><b>What should New Zealand tertiary education institutions do?</b></p>
<p>"It’s essential that institutions pass policies to support the development and use of OER. This is going to take some time. One of the difficulties in working the tertiary sector is that institutions are competitive with each other. We say that if institutions are worried about competition, they should join the OERu. As I said earlier, our open model enables us to reduce the costs of tuition to the learner to 20% of costs at existing mainstream institutions. The OERu is the new competition."</p>

<h5><strong>BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE</strong></h5>
<p>April is Open Education month here at NZCommons. Over at the Open Education Working Group, they have been putting together <a title="Open Education around the world" href="http://education.okfn.org/world/" target="_blank">a series of blog posts</a> about OER around the world. Here are a few snippets that caught our eye.</p>
<h3>India</h3>

<p>Subhajit Ganguly is an Ambassador for <a title="Open Knowledge Foundation India" href="http://in.okfn.org/" target="_blank">Open Knowledge Foundation India</a>, a group of professors, scientists, researchers, hackers, programmers, government and civil society representatives. He says: “Improving education in India is one of our priority areas and we are exploring open education approaches. We have to work as much as we can in ensuring at least basic education for those children who are not likely to see the light of education due to various reasons. This is a monumental task, taking into account the gigantic size of the population of India. However, every little helps. … We aim to arrange for vocational, profession-based education for the adult population. This way, we can work towards uplifting the economy from the grassroots.” <a title="Blog post on Open Education in India" href="http://education.okfn.org/open-education-india/" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.</p>

<h3>Rwanda</h3>

<p><a title="Bernard Nkuyubwatsi" href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/education/postgraduate-study/research-degrees/phd-research/phd/bernard-nkuyubwatsi" target="_blank">Bernard Nkuyubwatsi</a>, formerly of the Rwandan Ministry of Education, says: “The Open Learning Exchange Rwanda has been making educational resources more accessible and One Laptop per Child has distributed more than 100,000 laptops and aims to hit 500,000 computers distributed in primary schools.  … The most compelling accomplishment in opening up education in Rwanda is probably a high primary school enrolment, which was 98.7 percent in 2010. However, the road is still steep for secondary education (35.8 percent) and more importantly, higher education (5.5 percent).” <a title="Open Education in Rwanda" href="http://education.okfn.org/open-education-rwanda/" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.</p>
<h3>South Africa</h3>

<p>Dr Anna Wertlen is founder and chairperson of the Village Scribe Association for the advancement of innovative ICTs in development. She says: “The Village Scribe Association (VSA) is a small NGO in the poorest province of South Africa, the Eastern Cape. The Trust partners with a small IT company called eKhaya ICT, and together they have developed an online learning network that is suitable for school computer labs with no or low-quality internet access. Awarenet is a P2P social network, which combines the functions of well known social networks such as facebook, YouTube, Flickr and Wikipedia additionally to personal messages, blogs, chat rooms and creative spaces such as a scribble tool.” <a title="Blog post on Open Education in SA" href="http://education.okfn.org/open-education-south-africa/" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.</p>

<h3>South Korea</h3>

<p>Stella HaYoung Shin is a Ph.D candidate of Educational Policy and Administration at Sookmyung Women’s University in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, South Korea. She says:</p>
<p>"Much of my work at Sookmyung Women’s University (SMWU) has been devoted to developing OER surroundings in South Korea through launching and running SNOW (Sookmyung Network for Open World) during 2009--2010. SNOW has launched a vision of an ‘OER missionary’ to Korean users under the motif to provide valuable global OER to Korean users and accessible guidelines to make use of them. Comparing other OER interfaces and service providing organizations and web-sites, SNOW can be one of the most ‘kind’ and ‘open’ OERs allowing users find localised OER easily.</p>
<p>“SNOW developed an interactive OER localising platform for not only students of SMWU but also general users seeking ‘kind, local’ OERs. The most remarkable achievements of SNOW are the user-based content uploading-sharing-review system, SNOW Wiki system, as cooperative translation and interactive revision system and SNOW Eco-system as unique credit-saving system for donation system. SNOW can be a frontier model to envision the way to distribute OER efficiently, legally based on Creative Commons licences, and suggests a mutual vitalisation of Asian universities’ OER projects.” <a title="Blog post on Open Education in South Korea" href="http://education.okfn.org/open-education-south-korea/" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.</p>
