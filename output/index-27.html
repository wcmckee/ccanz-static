<h5><strong>BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE</strong></h5>
<p>The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa has now made nearly forty thousand images freely downloadable from its <a title="Collections Online Te Papa" href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Collections Online</a> digital database, giving the public access to the highest-resolution images it can and opening the way for creative reuse.</p>
<p>Around twenty thousand of these images are ‘No Known Copyright’ but upwards of seventeen thousand have been licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) <a title="Licences explained" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank">licence</a>. “This is just the start”, says Rights Advisor Victoria Leachman. “We’re constantly improving our database, constantly collecting, constantly digitising. At launch we released thirty thousand and we aim to make another fifteen thousand images available for download by the end of this financial year.” Releasing images of the collection for download is now a core part of the workflow of copyright assessment for Victoria. “It’s no longer a one-off project. It’s now a business-as-usual activity and providing the highest-resolution image file we can means much wider scope for potential reuse.”</p>
<p>Te Papa’s engagement with issues of copyright, licensing and openness <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/" target="_blank">has been a long process</a> and will continue to evolve. “We need to keep finding a balance between making images freely available and reuseable to benefit the public good and ensuring cost recovery so we astutely manage our taxpayer funding to help keep the museum going,” says Victoria. “We will continue to respond as Creative Commons grows as a movement within New Zealand.”</p>
<p>Victoria’s philosophy throughout has been one of incremental change: “let’s iterate!” She says “GLAM professionals tend to be completists, even perfectionists, and this isn’t a project you’re ever going to be able to ‘finish’. One of the big messages I’m always trying to get across is to start with what you can do now, at the foot of the mountain. Don’t worry about what’s at the top. It might get solved as you go and, if it doesn’t, you can better concentrate on solving it when you get there.”</p>
<p>The project’s launch in June 2014 generated a lot of positive feedback for Te Papa, both nationally and internationally. There was a significant visitation spike to the Collections Online site. Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage <a title="Press release" href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/AboutUs/Media/Pages/FreeAccessto30000HighResolutionImagesfromTePapasdigitalcollections.aspx" target="_blank">Chris Finlayson has recognised</a> Te Papa’s efforts and said: “These images from the national collection are a fantastic resource for New Zealanders. The Government’s <a title="NZGOAL" href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/" target="_blank">Open Access Licensing Framework</a> cuts red tape, allowing the public to share and enjoy these thousands of images freely, as well as making them more readily available for use by professionals in the education, historical, cultural, and creative sectors.”</p>
<p>“Another benefit of this work is the internal efficiency savings.” Victoria noted that Collections Online is used heavily by Te Papa’s own staff, and the new, clearer copyright and open licensing statements mean less confusion, less worry about inadvertently doing something illegal, and significantly less time taken up processing rights requests and queries. “Staff can cut straight through the necessary copyright bureaucracy and just do it themselves, if they need an image for a sign, say, or an e-newsletter.”</p>
<p>But of course the main benefit is the creative and collaborative potential that freely available public domain or out-of-copyright and CC-licensed works bestow. One example close to home is the creation of a new artwork for the <i>Ngā Toi Arts Te Papa</i> exhibition: <a title="Arts Te Papa" href="http://arts.tepapa.govt.nz/on-the-wall/knowledge-on-a-beam-of-starlight-panel-1/8015" target="_blank">“Knowledge on a beam of starlight”</a>, a vinyl work by Kerry Ann Lee using found images. With Te Papa’s permission Lee used images downloaded from Collections Online in her artwork.</p>
<p>So what’s next for Creative Commons at Te Papa? “Now we need to analyse the results so far, so that we can keep improving.” Victoria wants to learn how people are using the images, and what effect the freely downloadable content is having on Te Papa’s image licensing business. She is also very focussed on spreading the word, and making sure that Kiwis know that their cultural treasures are emerging into the free digital domain. “Creative Commons is still really early days in New Zealand. We want people to know what’s available and how they can use these incredible treasures.”</p>

<h5>BY NATHAN PARKER</h5>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SummitLogo1.png"><img class="wp-image-402" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SummitLogo1-1024x328.png" alt="SummitLogo1" width="605" height="194"></a> Image by Open Government Partnership. CC-BY.</p>
<p>As a teacher interested in open education I became quietly optimistic over<a href="posts/%20%20http://www.ssc.govt.nz/open-government-partnership" target="_blank"> the New Zealand government's acceptance</a> of an invitation to join the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/" target="_blank">Open Government Partnership</a>. The OGP is a forum of countries working to ensure that member governments are more open, accountable and responsive to its citizens. As part of their membership, the government is required to demonstrate how it will implement transparency, accountability, technology and innovation and civil society participation in government. They are also required to prepare an Action Plan of commitments aimed at working towards these OGP objectives.</p>
<p>As part of the OGP <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/united-kingdom/commitment/social-investment" target="_blank">the UK Prime Minister David Cameron promoted open government</a>, pledging to make the UK government the most open and transparent in the world and describing open data as the new raw material of the 21st century, holding governments to account, driving choice and improving public services. He also said it inspires innovation and enterprise that spurs social and economic growth. The UK government even committed that by 2015, it will be the most transparent social investment market in the Open Government Partnership and in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/207772/Open_Data_Charter.pdf" target="_blank">Open Data Charter</a> principles.</p>
<p>The Open Data Charter (ODC) recognizes the central role open data can play in improving government and governance and in stimulating growth through innovation in data-driven products and services. Open data is freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. ODC states that data should be Open by Default. The UK government's response has seen it planning to move <a href="posts/%20http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/29/uk-government-plans-switch-to-open-source-from-microsoft-office-suite" target="_blank">to using open source software and to standardise on open formats</a>. The policy would break the oligopoly of software suppliers and save the UK ongoing software licences.</p>
<p>As part of the OGP it is a requirement for governments to engage in open consultation with stakeholders, seeking input on mandated standards for software interoperability, data and document formats. Standards also for creating, viewing, sharing and using documents and that all government departments must comply with.</p>
<p>The OGP forum would allow the New Zealand government a legitimate reason to break away from its present procurement practices that have led to proprietary lock-in, limited interoperability, and excessive costs. This has the potential to make government ICT more open, cheaper and better connected and would have avoided the Novopay débâcle.</p>
<p>It would require government documentation and resources be in file formats and licensing that makes them accessible to all, shareable and reusable. Policies would still recognise national and international legislation pertaining to intellectual property, personally-identifiable and sensitive information. Everything else would be open.</p>
<p>The New Zealand government's own ICT strategy action plan has similar guiding principles of sharing by default, openness and transparency.</p>
<p>My optimism increased to enthusiasm when I thought the New Zealand government might follow a model similar to the UK. It has the potential for saving the government millions of dollars every year but more importantly - access to data, as images, publications and research (our nation's data heritage opened!).</p>
<p>I envisaged the Ministry of Education mandated by government policy, transitioning from closed proprietary software to open source software equivalents that could be improved and adapted for NZ. Learning institutions and students accessing the same software, regardless of family income or willingness to become pirates! All student work would be stored in formats that they owned rather than that of a software provider - digital portfolios managed to allow student content to be accessible into the future and without having to buy software to read it.</p>
<p>There is such huge potential with opened data, but I really got excited at an idea to use the dust gathering 1980's BSM programme (Bloody Silly Maths). This stunning Kiwiana and Pacifica influenced resource could be remixed under creative commons licenses - Kiwi ingenuity unleashed and backed by independent research fully funded by the MOE (presently a user-pays system for government research information). We could have a future proofed, digitally dusted programme of BSM (Bloody Sonic Maths).</p>
<p>I then began to dream of other iconic resources being opened up; students and teachers allowed to legally re-use images of Dame Whina on her 1975 land march hikoi or school journal articles on Sir Edmund, driving a Hamilton jet boat up the Ganges - all available for remixing for a modern audience.</p>
<p>In my excitement about New Zealand joining the OGP, I made an OIA request for a copy of the government's OGP draft action plan. I also asked for a list of submitters and stakeholders to the plan and the selection criteria for these stakeholders</p>
<p>The reply was a refusal from a closed government who used their right to withhold information!</p>
<p>So as an open educator, dropped is my dream of accountability and openness, gone is choice and improvements in public services; and as for inspiring innovation and enterprise that spurs social and economic growth – I would suggest moving to Waitati!</p>

<h5><strong>BY MATT MCREGOR</strong></h5>
<p>In June of this year, Wellington’s <em>Dominion Post</em> newspaper <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/10200454/Germs-study-points-finger-at-women" target="_blank">featured a curious story </a><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/10200454/Germs-study-points-finger-at-women" target="_blank">on its front page</a>: the prevalence of germs on cellphones.</p>
<p>The story was based on <a href="posts/%20https://peerj.com/articles/447" target="_blank">a small study</a> conducted by a group of scientists at the University of Oregon. This study was also covered by <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=11281833" target="_blank">The New Zealand Herald</a>.</p>
<p>According to Peter Griffin, Manager of the <a href="http://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Science Media Centre</a>, this unexpectedly broad coverage is partly explained by its publication in <a href="https://peerj.com/" target="_blank">PeerJ</a>, an online, open access scientific publisher.</p>
<p>As Peter points out, it is unlikely that the story would have featured on the front page without the newspaper’s journalists having free and open access to the original article.</p>
<p>“In order for journalists to effectively do their job, it’s essential that they have access to the information they need.”</p>
<p>“In a high speed news environment, research needs to be made available with no barriers to access to have the best chance of getting coverage. Open access research definitely has an advantage.”</p>
<p>Peter points out that most journalists don’t have immediate access to published research.</p>
<p>“Newsrooms today don’t have resources to subscribe to academic databases that would be useful in the process of generating news content. For journalists, this can be extremely frustrating.”</p>
<p>Peter points out that some academic publishers do offer free access to journalists, though only science journalists generally go through the process of getting approval. Most journalists are not signed up to publisher access schemes, which means they can face at least a twenty four hour delay in getting access from the researcher or publisher.</p>
<p>With open access publications like PeerJ, journalists can have immediate access, without barriers or delays.</p>
<p>Open access publication also allows newspapers to provide readers with links to the full-text article. As Peter points out, most journalists are going to want to give the public as much information as possible. Even if the journalist can find a way around publisher paywalls, the same will not be true of the general public.</p>
<p>Peter notes that, without access, journalists will be forced to rely on press releases -- if they cover research at all -- which is likely to mean that some context and complexity will be missed.</p>
<p>“If you want research to be covered well,” Peter says, "make it available in a timely fashion, in a format that can be used -- and shared with readers.”</p>
<p>Peter also points out the importance of scientists writing for a general audience -- and sharing those works under a Creative Commons licence. Peter notes the success of <em><a href="http://theconversation.com/au" target="_blank">The Conversation</a></em>, an Australian online publication that publishes hundreds of opinion pieces by Australian academics.</p>
<p>Pieces published on <em>The Conversation</em> are made available under a Creative Commons Attribution No Derivatives licence, which means that commercial publications can reprint articles for free, as long as they provide attribution and ask permission before making any changes.</p>
<p>As a result, New Zealand newspapers have reprinted dozens of articles by Australasian academics on a range of science subjects -- subjects that are otherwise unlikely to have received coverage.</p>
<p>If New Zealand researchers want broader coverage, they need to publish in open access venues. As Peter concludes, “Open access to New Zealand scientific publications is needed for broader mass media coverage. It should be available quickly, in an accessible form.</p>
<p>“A lot of great research by New Zealand scientists is never seeing the light of day, because it’s not accessible.”</p>

<h5><strong>BY VICTORIA REA</strong></h5>
<p>While there has been no New Zealand court decision regarding the use or validity of Creative Commons Licenses, there have been decisions we can turn to in comparable overseas jurisdictions. This will give us some foundation for deciding how the New Zealand courts might treat a case involving CC. Since Creative Commons licensing is relatively new, there are only a few cases that illustrate how the courts might treat CC licensing.</p>
<p><strong><em>Curry v Audax</em></strong></p>
<p>One notable case comes from the Netherlands: <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Curry_v._Audax" target="_blank">Curry v Audax</a>. In this case, a former MTV star took a case against a Dutch gossip magazine. Adam Curry, former MTV star sued “Weekend” for a copyright infringement after the magazine published photos of his daughter without his permission. The photos had been posted on the Flickr photo-sharing site covered by a creative Commons – Attribution – Non Commercial Share Alike licence. In this case, it was held that the terms of the Creative Commons licence were binding.</p>
<p>An important issue that came up concerned the due diligence that the company should have performed to find the type of license that had been placed on the photos. The defendant magazine claimed that the photos had been publicly shared; there was, therefore, no need to seek authority to publish. However, the courts held that the company did in fact have to ask for authority to publish, noting that it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that they are meeting the requirements of the CC license.</p>
<p><strong><em>GateHouse Media, Inc. v. That’s Great News</em>.</strong></p>
<p>A second case is from the Northern District of Illinois in the United States: GateHouse Media, Inc. v. That’s Great News. This case includes a claim that the defendant violated the terms of a Creative Commons licence covering the plaintiffs copyrighted works. Gate House Media publish a number of local newspapers for the region. The Register Start, a local newspaper, provides its content online to subscribers under a Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Non Derivative License. The defendant party used this information for the creation of plaques for people mentioned in the news.</p>
<p>This case was settled on August 17, 2010. The settlement was not made public,  which is unfortunate, as there are are several interesting aspects to this case. The first is the use of Creative Commons licenses for the purpose of blocking content for the commercial use and whether placing these kinds of strict licenses is actually in the interest of commercial competition. The second is the extent to which the No Derivatives licence applies and whether in this instance the defendant will have been said to alter the work.</p>
<p><em><strong>Deutschlandradio v Photographer</strong></em></p>
<p>The third case to look at is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140326/11405526695/german-court-says-creative-commons-non-commercial-licenses-must-be-purely-personal-use.shtml" target="_blank">a case from Germany</a> that recently discussed the use of the Non Commercial Creative Commons licence and how far it extended in use. The case revolved around a photo from Flickr released on a Non Commercial license, which was used by Deutschlandradio -- a public broadcaster and non commercial organisation. The website also included the name of the artist, licence and link to its terms. Despite this, the artist sued. The public broadcaster pointed out there was no charge for their website, no advertising, no sponsorship.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the judge treated the use by  Deutschlandradio as commercial. In doing so, the judge relied on German Common law which defines non commercial as purely for personal use. This case reveals how different common law positions from different jurisdictions may effect how Creative Commons licenses are treated in different countries.</p>
<p><em><strong>Chang v Virgin Mobile</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the closest jurisdictional cases is from Australia: <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Chang_v._Virgin_Mobile" target="_blank">Chang v Virgin Mobile</a>. This case involves a Creative Commons licensed image in Flickr being used in an Australian phone advertisement. Chang brought a suit against Virgin under a number of causes of action including invasion of privacy, copyright infringement and breach of contract. The takeaway from the case was that Creative Commons licenses only address the creator’s copyright. The licenses do not affirmatively affect publicity or privacy rights.</p>
<p><em><strong>SGAE v Fernandez</strong></em></p>
<p>The Spanish case <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/SGAE_v._Fernandez" target="_blank">SGAE v Fernandez</a> looks at a Creative Commons licensing issue for music at a bar. SGAE, a collecting society, sued a disco bar owner alleging that he had failed to pay SGAE the license fee required for public performances of music. The Court rejected the claims because the bar owner successfully showed that the music playing in his bar was not managed by the collecting society but rather was licensed under a Creative Commons license.</p>
<p>The important thing to take away from this case though is that in nearly all previous cases the Spanish courts had ruled in favour of SGAE, under the assumption that the collecting society managed most of the music. This case set a new precedent in Spain and showed that courts recognise different kinds of licensing for music.</p>
<p><em><strong>Gerlach v DVU</strong></em></p>
<p>The final case is from Berlin: <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Gerlach_vs._DVU" target="_blank">Gerlach v DVU</a>. In this case, the validity of the Creative Commons license was upheld. The facts are quite straightforward: A woman called Nina Gerlach took a photograph of German Politician Thilo Sarrazin and uploaded it to Wikipedia under a Creative Commons licence. The defendant, a German Political party website, posted the picture without attribution or a link to the original as specified in the terms of the licence. Gerlach sued for breach of licence. The judge considered that the defendant was in breach of the licence and therefore breaching copyright. The judge issued an injunction, ordering the website to remove the picture. This is the best case law example to date showing how Creative Commons Licenses are being upheld in jurisdictions, as it shows judges willing to step in where there has been an obvious breach of the license.</p>
<p><em><strong>Conclusions</strong></em></p>
<p>Looking at why there haven’t been many cases involving Creative Commons licenses there are two main reasons that stand out:</p>

<li>the licences are new, which  means that there is always going to be a time-lapse before problems actually arise that are serious enough to be resolved in court; and,</li>

    <li>Creative Commons licenses are simple to understand, which may mean that there has actually been very few major breaches, which may in turn lead to very few cases being brought that are relevant to Creative Commons.</li>

</ol>
<p>While favourable court cases help to promote CC adoption by commercial enterprises and the public sector,  it is important to remind everyone that there is no reason to doubt their validity in the first place. Nevertheless, as these examples show, it is likely that if a case were to arise in New Zealand that the court would uphold the licenses.</p>

<h5><strong>BY MATT MCGREGOR</strong></h5>
<p>This year, the theme for <a title="OA Week in NZ" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/10/oaweek2014/" target="_blank">Open Access Week</a> internationally is Generation Open. At Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ, we’re celebrating that by taking a look at why Kiwi students need <a title="OA Research" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/research/" target="_blank">Open Access to research</a>.</p>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8hxKH3-42U0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>At its heart, the argument for free student access to published scholarly research is this: students need access to the best and most up-to-date knowledge in order to learn, and get the best possible return on their investment in their own higher education. Producing highly educated, well-informed citizens is in everyone’s best interests and has huge knock-on benefits, from increased innovation in business to better public policy.</p>
<p>Currently, though, there are significant financial and technical barriers to the Open Access goal of all scholarly information being freely and immediately available online. Higher education institutions (HEIs) -- even the rich ones -- often can’t afford the wide range of journal subscriptions required by students, and this problem gets worse for smaller HEIs with smaller budgets.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a problem for students doing their own research, it’s also a problem for their teachers. If lecturers and professors can’t access the latest information and ideas, they can’t teach them to their students. It’s also a problem after graduation. Suddenly, the limited access to research students did have through whatever their HEIs could afford is withdrawn. This severely compromises the contribution graduates are able to make in their chosen fields.</p>
<p>The original aim of scholarly publishing is to spread knowledge. Closer to home, the goals of the NZ Education Act are to maintain, advance, and assist in the application of knowledge, to develop intellectual independence, and to promote community learning. At Creative Commons Aotearoa, we believe that an essential step in achieving those goals is Open Access to research. Open Access ensures students’ learning isn’t artificially limited by the subscriptions their HEIs happen to be able to afford, and it means that wealth and geography are no longer barriers to the knowledge and learning from which the whole of NZ society benefits.</p>
<p>For Open Access Week 2014, we celebrate the development of the <a title="OA Button" href="https://www.openaccessbutton.org/" target="_blank">Open Access Button</a>, an online tool developed by students for students that helps overcome some of the technological barriers to research by helping locate free copies of scholarly research online.</p>
<p>Here in Aotearoa, we celebrate the three Kiwi Universities that are actively working towards enabling free student access to knowledge: <a title="OA at Waikato Uni" href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/open-access/" target="_blank">Waikato</a>, <a title="OA at Lincoln Uni" href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/open-access/" target="_blank">Lincoln</a> and <a title="OA at Canterbury Uni" href="http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/blogs/counterculture.php?itemid=18365" target="_blank">Canterbury</a>. Read more about their journeys <a title="Open Access at the University of Waikato" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/open-access-university-waikato/" target="_blank">here</a> (Waikato), <a title="Lincoln University’s Open Access Policy" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/lincoln-universitys-open-access-policy/" target="_blank">here</a> (Lincoln) and <a title="Canterbury’s mandatory research deposit" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/mandatory-research-deposit-university-canterbury/" target="_blank">here</a> (Canterbury). Now we call for all Kiwi HEIs -- universities, colleges, polytechnics -- to follow suit.</p>

<h5>BY ANTON ANGELO</h5>
<p>From little things, big things grow: a personal reflection on <a title="Mandatory research deposit policy announcement" href="http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/blogs/counterculture.php?itemid=18365" target="_blank">mandatory deposit of research</a> at the University of Canterbury, by <a title="Anton Angelo" href="http://mojo.org/portfolio/" target="_blank">Anton Angelo</a>, Repository Manager at the University of Canterbury Library.</p>
<p>Last week I had an email discussion with the developer for our university research information system. My request is to make a file upload field required rather than optional. It, in the scheme of things, is a tiny change -- a couple of lines of code in an application that is going to be used by a few hundred people at a medium scale university.</p>
<p>In this case though, the change that this represents is huge. It is the bleeding edge of a change in the way that we understand intellectual property, and realigns the academy with its original intention of being a <strong><em>univers</em></strong>ity.</p>
<p>Canterbury, like <a title="IRs around the world" href="http://roarmap.eprints.org/" target="_blank">well over 200 other universities</a> is adopting an ‘institutional mandate’ for depositing research into its Institutional Repository (IR; see <a title="Institutional Repositories 101" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/institutional-repositories-101/" target="_blank">Amanda Curnow’s clear description</a> of what an IR is). We have purposefully kept the word ‘mandate’, as the implication of imposing something on scholars provoked the discussion we wanted -- positive engagement with what we were proposing. In reality the policy suggests that, in the absence of a good reason, every time a scholar publishes something it should be made freely available, and we provide a mechanism to do that with our IR. If a scholar wishes to opt out, they should feel free, but we’re curious to know why.</p>
<p>The small technical change we are making is that we’re requiring a copy of a research output submitted for the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) process to be made available and openly accessible for the entire world, by uploading it to our IR. Currently, University of Canterbury scholars can volunteer to upload articles, and about 8% of our research output is put on the web and openly accessible. By making the file upload field required, we hope to see a tenfold increase in deposits.</p>
<p>As usual, there are historical precedents. The library of Alexandria had a mandate to take all the books arriving in the port, copy them, keep the originals, and return the copies. This way -- along with an excellent and aggressive collections budget -- the biggest library in the world was created.</p>
<p>Reaction to the suggestion of the policy in the community was interesting. The vast majority of faculty research committee meetings and private conversations ended with, “why are we not doing this already?”. It underscored the importance most researchers seem to place on having the widest possible audience for their work. There were exceptions to that, usually based on the culture of a particular academic discipline. For example: high-energy physicists (and others) already use a repository, <a title="Arxiv" href="http://arxiv.org/" target="_blank">ArXive</a>. Why should they bother with another one?</p>
<p>I admit that uploading things to the IR is a faff for a lot of reasons. For example, because of the copyright most publishers take when they agree to print an article, scholars have to upload a version that is not the final published one. Academics are not great administrators, and can lose their manuscripts. As well as that it is an extra button to push, a file to hunt down on their hard drive, and then finally, troubling thoughts of “am I <em>allowed </em>to do this?” can overwhelm all but the most robustly legally minded. That last one -- what are you allowed to do with your own work? -- is a doozy. A scholar in the humanities admitted to me that on being offered the loan of a book his first thought was, “is he allowed to loan me that”? So entrenched are our anxieties on copyright that even the thing that lets libraries exist can be questioned by people who should know much, much better.</p>
<p>I make no apologies for the faff, for it is not faff of our making. We pay researchers to do research, and their research needs to be available for that most old-fashioned of reasons: the common good. You can quantify the good all you like in terms of innovation and product development and state corporate bottom line maximisation, but for me the qualitative argument comes first, and looms largest. It’s the right thing to do. So why is it hard? Wherefore the faff? Traditional academic publishers are on a bit of a losing wicket on this one. Made gigantic on the economic imperatives of globalisation and the efficiencies of the library ‘big deal’, they now have profits they are legally bound to protect for their shareholders. Faff is their stock-in-trade as a way of slowing down the opposition -- the IR.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways academic publishers try to slow down deposit into IRs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most standard publisher-author agreements allow only an obscure version of the work to be added to the IR.</li>

    <li>They confuse the Open Access (OA) landscape by offering their own version of openly accessible articles, and play divide and conquer with their customers by making the academic pay a charge (often in the thousands of dollars) to publish under an open licence.

<ul>
<li>Additionally, sometimes they offer their own ‘open’ licences, resulting in even greater uncertainty.</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>They employ third parties to scour IRs to find material that could be non-compliant, and send threatening letters. Libraries, being excellent corporate citizens, respond to these by removing material.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Knowing that old data is less sexy data, they require embargoes on the release of IR versions of articles, knowing that makes the IRs less useful.
</pre>


<ul>
<li>As well as this, at least one publisher requires embargoes on IR content <em>only if the institution requires its scholars to submit their research outputs to its IR</em>, an open recognition that IRs threaten publishers’ business model.</li>

</ul>
<p>It may seem with all those tactics that there is a great conflict going on, but there really isn’t. It is not a war. The arbitrary exclusions and hoops above are the artefacts of a rapidly changing (and potentially failing) business model. New publishers, like PeerJ, Hindawi, and PLoS among many, many others, are simply starting with the assumption that the material will be OA, and they are a low or non-profit business, and can undercut the old guard entirely.</p>
<p>At Canterbury, we have made a tiny technical change. Instead of asking scholars to volunteer their work to be made openly accessible, we ask why they would not. That little thing signals a mighty change for the availability of new knowledge to the world.</p>

<h5><strong>BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE</strong></h5>
<p>The basic principle driving Open Access is that NZ taxpayer-funded research outputs -- including journal articles, conference proceedings and research data -- should be made openly available to Kiwi taxpayers, including businesses.</p>
<p>To celebrate <a title="OA Week NZ 2014" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/10/oaweek2014/" target="_blank">Open Access Week 2014</a>, we thought we’d share some thoughts on this topic from businesses and NGOs around Aotearoa.</p>
<p>Lillian Grace, CEO of <a title="Wiki NZ" href="http://wikinewzealand.org/" target="_blank">Wiki New Zealand</a>, says: “The value realised from publicly funded research will be hugely increased by making it open for others throughout our country to learn and apply findings to business, social, economic and environmental endeavours."</p>
<p>Oliver Hartwich, Executive Director of the <a title="NZ Initiative" href="http://nzinitiative.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZ Initiative</a>, says: "Taxpayers should have access to the results of research they are funding. This is why I support Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ in their campaign for Open Access publishing."</p>
<p>Ed Corkery, CEO of <a title="Koordinates" href="https://koordinates.com/" target="_blank">Koordinates</a>, says: “We believe open access to research data is central to a brighter future for NZ. Academic research has the potential to influence society in so many more ways if it were easier to access. When academia, governments and private companies work together to unlock data, we all benefit from a healthier environment, stronger economy and deeper understanding of the world we live in.”</p>
<p>Andrew Preston, Co-Founder of <a title="Publons" href="https://publons.com/" target="_blank">Publons</a> says: "Access to scientific knowledge is essential for future research and development. This includes not just the article itself but the important context and knowledge that surrounds it, including peer review. Our business is built on the idea of encouraging open discussion and review and many others will be too."</p>
<p>Dave Lane, of <a title="Catalyst IT" href="http://www.catalyst.net.nz/" target="_blank">Catalyst IT</a> and president of the <a title="NZ Open Source Society" href="http://nzoss.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZ Open Source Society</a>, says: ""The unquestionable success of the Internet is a testament to the value of sharing freely in the software world. Open Access to government-funded research is simply good sense and good business. Adopting a policy of sharing allows those of us in NZ with great ideas, skills and energy to add value to information and knowledge created for the greater good. I have no doubt that many positive and disruptive developments will result, and I can't wait to see them along with the rest of the world."</p>
<p>Gareth Morgan, CEO of the <a title="Morgan Foundation" href="http://morganfoundation.org.nz/" target="_blank">Morgan Foundation</a>, says: “The Morgan Foundation is dedicated to getting Kiwis talking about important issues. Yet to have an informed debate we need to have an informed public. Too often the person on the street doesn’t have all the facts in order to make up their mind, or the information is provided in a way that people can’t understand. That is why we support Open Access policies - so Kiwis have the information they need to make the big calls.”</p>
<p>Patrick Fitzgerald, MD of <a title="Squiz" href="http://www.squiz.net/nz" target="_blank">Squiz</a>, says: "Anything that makes it easier for New Zealand's businesses, institutions, students, innovators and entrepreneurs to get the best information and solve problems quicker sounds like a win. Opening access to publicly funded research would be a good step in that direction."</p>
<p>Mike Riversdale, ‘<a title="Miramar Mike" href="http://work.miramarmike.co.nz/" target="_blank">Miramar Mike</a>’ tech consultant, says: “Payment for services rendered should always be at a level that recognises the true value of the output. This is why I am happy (nay insistent) that some of my tax dollars be spent on research as we look to create sustainable methods of ensuring value flows into New Zealand. Part of that value lies in ensuring that all New Zealanders can build upon the research. Seeing as my taxes have already covered the costs, businesses should be able to profit from the research. I therefore wholeheartedly support the call that all NZ publicly funded research institutions and research funders that they adopt Open Access policies.”</p>
<p>As Alfred Spector wrote on the <a title="Google Research blog" href="http://research.google.com/pubs/AlfredSpector.html" target="_blank">Google Research</a> blog, "Google has always believed that by improving access to the world’s knowledge, we can help improve everyone’s lives. When it comes to scientific research, we have consistently said that open access to publications speeds up research, accelerates innovation, and helps grow the global economy."</p>
<p>This year, we are celebrating Open Access Week 20-26 October <a title="OA Week NZ 2014" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/10/oaweek2014/" target="_blank">throughout the country</a>. If you have any events of your own to add, please <a title="Contact CCANZ" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/contact/" target="_blank">let us know</a>. <a title="OA Week" href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/" target="_blank">Open Access Week</a> is a global event, now in its seventh year, that promotes Open Access as the new norm in scholarship and publishing.</p>

<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ is calling for all New Zealanders to have <a title="Open Access to Research" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/research/">Open Access to publicly funded research</a>.</p>
<p>Matt McGregor of Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ says: “From the point of view of the general public, the current system of scholarly publishing is broken. Taxpayers can end up paying for published research three times over: funding the research; employing the researcher; and buying access for a limited number of students and researchers to read the final publication. The public, despite this investment, generally receives no access whatsoever.”</p>
<p>This means that the social, cultural and economic benefits of taxpayer-funded research -- including new research, innovative products, better public policy and a well-informed citizenry -- are not fully realised.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of universities and research funders around the world have adopted Open Access policies. It’s great to see universities like Lincoln, Canterbury and Waikato leading the way in New Zealand on this front,” says McGregor.</p>
<p>“It would be of enormous benefit to New Zealand for the rest of the research sector to follow in their footsteps, and adopt Open Access mandates. This will enable everyone -- including teachers, students, journalists and businesses -- to have access to the research that we all pay for.”</p>
<p>Fabiana Kubke, neuroscientist, Senior Lecturer at the University of Auckland and Chair of the Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ Advisory Panel, says:</p>
<p>"We put a man on the moon about half a century ago yet we still haven’t solved the problem of access to research. The more broadly we disseminate our findings, the more likely we are to achieve the goals set out by the NZ Education Act: to maintain, advance, and assist in the application of knowledge, to develop intellectual independence, and to promote community learning.</p>
<p>“These goals can be best met by making the research outputs available under Open Access and, equally importantly, allowing re-use. <a title="Licences" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences-2/">Creative Commons licences</a> enable this to happen."</p>
<p>Kiwi academics are starting to embrace the possibilities inherent in Open Access, but their efforts will need to be supported by mandates from research organisations and funding bodies. Chris Whelan, Executive Director of <a href="http://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/">Universities NZ</a>, says:</p>
<p>“We support Open Access policies across the tertiary sector. At present, published research is hugely expensive for public universities to access, and is largely inaccessible to the wider public. These costs have risen enormously over the last two decades, and we have not seen a reciprocal increase in benefits to either the university sector or the public.</p>
<p>“The existing paywalls to scholarship slow down the pace of discovery and prevent the benefits of university scholarship from being fully realised. Given the substantial public investment in research, Open Access policies should be adopted across the research sector, to ensure that New Zealanders have access to the research they fund.</p>
<p>“This will put New Zealand in line with universities and research funders overseas, and enable universities to more effectively share the fruits of their research.”</p>
<p>For <a title="Open Access Week 2014" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/10/oaweek2014/">Open Access Week 2014</a> (20-26 October), we celebrate the three NZ universities -- Lincoln, Canterbury and Waikato -- that have Open Access policies. Aotearoa also has a world-leading Open Access and licensing mandate for public sector data and information, dubbed <a title="Open Government" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/government/">NZGOAL</a>, which was approved by Cabinet in 2010.</p>
<p>Now, Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ is calling for all publicly funded research in New Zealand to be Open Access.</p>
