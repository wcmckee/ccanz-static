<p></p>
<p>Earlier this year, Upper Hutt City Library launched <a href="http://uhcl.recollect.co.nz/" target="_blank">RECOLLECT</a>, an online repository of materials from its community archive. The announcement made<a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/upper-hutt-leader/7825164/Upper-Hutt-heritage-database-makes-history" target="_blank"> the front page of the Upper Hutt Leader</a>, where it was celebrated as “a New Zealand first.”</p>
<p>The RECOLLECT platform allows users to browse and discuss archival materials. At present, the site has over 15, 000 photos and hundreds of other items freely available to access and download.</p>
<p>What was not mentioned in the Leader story, however, was perhaps Recollect’s most remarkable feature: nearly all its heritage items—old and new—are made available under a Creative Commons Attribution or Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial licence.</p>
<p>The Upper Hutt Community Archive was created in 1996, to host heritage materials from the local community. Fourteen year on, the Archive has grown into a rich resource for local residents, and includes thousands of photos, newspapers, oral histories and maps.</p>
<p>Until recently, most of these archival items were largely unknown. Members of the public would have to request copies of heritage materials, and would be charged an administrative fee by the UHCL. As UHCL Archivist Reid Perkins points out, this took up valuable staff time and tended to “put people off using the images.”</p>
<p>RECOLLECT allows user to download images from UHCL’s rich archive of local heritage items. As Reid points out, “this has been a popular feature. People like the fact that they have easy access to these images, which of course if we were using a traditional All Rights Reserved copyright model we wouldn’t be able to do.”</p>
<p>Reid came to the RECOLLECT project in May 2012, and says he was “very impressed” with the library’s attitude towards sharing and reuse. “A lot of institutions are quite risk averse. I was very pleased to come here and see that they didn’t seem to have that attitude.”</p>
<p>In partnership with <a href="http://www.micrographics.co.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Micrographic Services Ltd</a>., library staff agreed that the Creative Commons licences fit with the general ethos of the archive. Their remarkable range of openly licensed resources includes collections of The Upper Hutt Leader itself.</p>
<p>Reid admits that the question of rights has given him some nervous nights, but that most people seem to be willing to allow the public to access and share their local heritage. “There does seem to be a good, positive attitude here.”</p>
<p>The main feeling seems to be that people are proud of their local history and want it better known. They want people to access their images.”</p>
<p>Reid points to the collection of photos by <a href="http://www.upperhuttcity.com/page/1079/JacksonWilfredRevelle.boss" target="_blank">Revelle Jackson, a prominent Hutt Valley photographer</a>. Jackson was the official photographer for local events—including A&amp;P shows, birthday parties and weddings—for several decades, and his collection of over 8000 photos is now available for download for distribution and reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial licence.</p>
<p>When asked about other libraries following in the footsteps of UHCL, Reid points out that most libraries and archives are caught between two basic mandates: to protect the collections and to provide access. While Reid understands the dilemmas many librarians and archivists face, he says he’s “pleased to be working in a place where it does seem to lean the other way, towards openness.”</p>
<p>Reid says that he would “definitely encourage other institutions to go down this route.”</p>
<p>For smaller, regional organisations, open access and open licensing are a good way to encourage the local community to share and reuse heritage materials. “Our issue is getting people to use the stuff. Our issue is access, getting people using our collections. As soon as we are fairly sure that there aren’t any copyright claims, we want to put the work in circulation.”</p>
<p>As local groups continue to donate materials to the archive, Reid looks forward to growing Recollect. “A lot of material is coming in digital form only. We often digitise the material, and let the donors keep the original. We’re building up a lot of material like that.”</p>
<p>As the collections grow, so does the range of materials available for sharing and creative reuse. “I’ve been getting donors’ permission to use their material digitally, and this includes Creative Commons licensing. I make a point of telling people, because they might be worried or misunderstand, but no one seems that concerned. They want their images to be out there and available.”</p>
<p>“I’ve always made an effort to explain the licences to donors, and no one’s been bothered so far, to be honest. So far, everyone’s agreed.”</p>

<p></p>
<p>On November 23 and 24, InternetNZ is holding its first regional NetHui in Dunedin, <a href="http://2012-south.nethui.org.nz/" target="_blank">Nethui South</a>. As usual, <a href="http://2012-south.nethui.org.nz/programme" target="_blank">the programme</a> runs the gamut of Internet issues, including policy, governance, law, copyright, education, society, culture, business and innovation</p>
<p>For those used to specialist conferences--boasting text heavy powerpoints, unfamiliar jargon and long-winded presentations--NetHui comes as a welcome relief. Aside from the keynote addresses, NetHui is a remarkably participatory conference. In an education session at July's Auckland NetHui, I heard from teachers, government officials, private sector workers, parents, concerned citizens, librarians, and even a high school student volunteering at the event. Where else does this happen? I can think of no other event with nearly this level of popular participation. While 'unconferences' have become increasingly popular, <a href="http://2012-south.nethui.org.nz/registration" target="_blank">Nethui remains, at $40, by far the cheapest</a>, and is far more likely to include those that would be otherwise priced out of attendance.</p>
<p>So, we like Nethui. Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been proud to feature in the last two events. In the 2011 conference, Creative Commons co-founder Lawrence Lessig turned up, and we launched our popular 'CC Kiwi' video. In July 2012, we had a great discussion about the future of open access and open licensing in New Zealand's universities with academics from New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>For NetHui South, we're continuing our support. We're a community sponsor of the conference and, as usual, we're hosting <a href="http://2012-south.nethui.org.nz/programme" target="_blank">a free Creative Commons meeting<del> after</del> BEFORE the official events</a>, at 11am at the Kakapo Room of the Museum. Whether you are a teacher, student, researcher, creator, innovator or are simply curious about open culture, feel free to come along.</p>
<p>At this free meetup, you'll:</p>
<p>• Learn about ‘The New Storytelling,’ a Creative Commons Mix &amp; Mash style showcase for New Zealand students;</p>
<p>• Hear from local teachers, academics and students about the use of open licensing in education and research;</p>
<p>• Discuss the use of Creative Commons licences in culture and the arts; and</p>
<p>• Help shape the next phase of the Creative Commons project in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>In typical NetHui fashion, the meet-up will be open and participatory. Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is keen to hear about your CC experiences, answer your CC questions and learn more about your use of CC licences.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in coming along, please email <a title="Email CC" href="mailto:admin@creativecommons.org.nz">admin@creativecommons.org.nz</a></p>
<p>When: 6.30pm, Friday 23 November</p>
<p>Where: Museum</p>

<p></p>
<p>In the<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/culturegabfest/2012/10/pitch_perfect_seth_macfarlane_and_higher_education_online_slate_s_culture.html" target="_blank"> October 10 edition of Slate Magazine's Culture podcast</a>, the hosts interviewed Al Filreis, an English professor from the University of Pennsylvania, about his class in modern and contemporary poetry. At first glance, this seems like an unusually parochial choice: however much we might want to hear Filreis' expert riff on Allan Ginsberg or Lyn Hejinian, most of us antipodeans are unlikely fly 20 hours for the privilege, let alone pay <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/about/faq.php" target="_blank">US$40, 000+ in tuition fees</a>. In fact, most of us are unlikely to even get in to this Ivy League school--ranked in 2011 as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania#Admissions_selectivity" target="_blank">sixth most selective University in the United States</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, even for a regional American podcast, this parochialism is a stretch. In reality, Filreis was interviewed because he'd recently started<a href="https://www.coursera.org/courses" target="_blank"> to teach his poetry course for free</a>, on the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera </a>platform, as a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). As one of the first humanities courses on Coursera, Filreis was, as he put it, "the doggy in the window for the humanities." Eventually, over 30, 000 students worldwide registered for his course (incidentally, this is equivalent to the 31, 000 students who apply to attend UPenn each year).</p>
<p>[quote float="right"]MOOCs have quickly spread to cover nearly all subject areas in higher education[/quote]</p>
<p>Founded by Stanford University computer scientists, Coursera is one of several prominent MOOC platforms and consortia--including <a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a>, <a href="http://ocwconsortium.org/" target="_blank">OpenCourseWare</a> and <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" target="_blank">OERu</a>--to provide university-level courses to millions of students across the world, for free. Initially used to disseminate highly technical courses in engineering and computer science, MOOCs have quickly spread to cover nearly all subject areas in higher education. While OpenCourseWare has existed since 2002, recent media coverage, including the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/education/consortium-of-colleges-takes-online-education-to-new-level.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/higher-education-network-blog/2012/sep/13/mooc-buzzword-meaning-higher-education" target="_blank">Guardian</a> and <a href="http://www.listener.co.nz/commentary/the-internaut/online-learning-the-future-of-education/" target="_blank">a cover story in The Listener</a>, suggests that MOOCs have finally gone mainstream.</p>
<p>Far from being a paean to the benevolence of MOOCs, however, the Slate conversation with Filreis quickly turned to criticisms of the Coursera model. Coursera, like Udacity but unlike many other MOOC platforms, is backed by venture capitalists, and run as a for-profit company. As most MOOCs are based in prominent  US institutions, platforms like Coursera can also be seen as an expansion of the US dominance of global higher education.</p>
<p>Richard White, answering a question about MOOCs <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/open-access-a-challenge-2/" target="_blank">in the comments thread here last week</a>, nicely summed up the debate. MOOCs, he wrote, are: "Either the most fundamental transformation of tertiary learning ever or the next form of US cultural colonisation as companies and Ivy league Universities fight to be the Facebook of higher education – depending on who you listen to!"</p>
<p>Anticipating these kinds of questions, Filreis framed part of his defence of the Coursera model in terms of ownership:  [quote]"Now, they could be corrupted and taken over by venture capitalists later, but I'll be out by then. The moment we start charging a cent for tuition, I'm gone. But I have a contract that allows me to take my materials, and build another platform, or mothball it, or deliver it for free on the Net."[/quote]</p>
<p>Put this way, All Rights Reserved copyright appears to be a necessary line of defence against the potential appropriations of venture capital. While Filreis didn't mention copyright, the underlying logic was that by maintaining All Rights Reserved copyright for his teaching materials, Filreis could prevent a for-profit company like Coursera from misusing--in this case, monetising--his work. By claiming that All Rights Reserved copyright can prevent misuse, Filreis repeated an argument which has become quite familiar in the world of open licensing, usually derived from a fear of commercial appropriation or unwanted remix works.</p>
<p>While I understand Filreis' argument, if we approach the issue from a different angle, the question of copyright begins to look a little more complex. By moving away from potential misuse, we could instead ask: what are the consequences of limiting reuse and adaptation? By preventing perceived misuse, what potential uses--and what learning--might All Rights Reserved copyright prevent?</p>
<p>On this question, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/about/terms" target="_blank">Coursera's terms of use are clear</a>: "You may download material from the Sites only for your own personal, non-commercial use. You may not otherwise copy, reproduce, retransmit, distribute, publish, commercially exploit or otherwise transfer any material, nor may you modify or create derivatives works of the material."</p>
<p>[quote float="left"]By preventing perceived misuse, what potential uses--and what learning--might All Rights Reserved copyright prevent?[/quote]</p>
<p>The problem with this, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/opencontent/why-oer" target="_blank">as David Wiley puts it</a>, is that "Successful educators share most completely with the most students." By using ARR in education, learning becomes a highly structured and centralised experience; some potentially important activities for non-American learners, like remixing and sharing course materials, become illegal.</p>
<p>It is also likely that, without the ability to adapt and redistribute course materials, MOOCs will remain, to their detriment, culturally specific; this means that the accusation of 'cultural imperialism' becomes that much more likely to stick.</p>
<p>This issue becomes more stark when we consider that, according to <a href="http://www.col.org/resources/speeches/2011presentation/Pages/2011-05-16.aspx" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://www.col.org/resources/speeches/2011presentation/Pages/2011-05-16.aspx" target="_blank">reports</a> from UNESCO, we will need between 100 and 150 million extra places to meet demand from qualified students who cannot afford to access existing institutions. According to <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ED/pdf/RANKINGS/Stamenka-JohnDaniel.pdf" target="_blank">Stamenka Uvalić-Trumbić of UNESCO</a>, "Accommodating the additional 98 million students would require more than four major universities (30,000 students) to open every week for the next fifteen years</p>
<p>For this reason, the OER university (OERu), a consortium of higher education institutions including the University of Canterbury, Otago Polytechnic and NMIT, has decided to only use teaching materials licensed under Creative Commons. Its pilot course, <a href="http://wikieducator.org/AST1000" target="_blank">Regional Relations in Asia and the Pacific</a>, run out of the University of Southern Queensland, begins on November 23.</p>
<p>Unlike most other MOOCs, which usually offer no more than a certificate of completion, this course will be run for academic credit. As Wayne Mackintosh wrote during <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/the-oer-university/" target="_blank">our OA Week coverage</a>, "using OER<strong> </strong>it is possible to build a parallel learning universe to provide more affordable education for learners currently excluded from the formal education sector."</p>

<p>I think I met Penny Carnaby, then National Librarian, back in 2010.</p>
<p>She did not have to convince me about the value of Open Access. What I did learn from her was that Open Access had implications that went beyond the value of sharing scientific findings as broadly as possible. Science after all is a human activity, and as such, part of our cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Until then I thought of research publications as being about sharing results – or rather making them publicly known. There is value in that, and the more broadly access to those findings is given, and the more flexible the licenses for reuse that are attached to them, the better. Open Access under open licenses allows that. But when challenged with the idea of the cultural heritage of science I started thinking about what science is – and about how there is much more to science than just that published article.</p>
<p>Research articles constitute a narrative that is built around the gathered data. The structure of that story is partly defined by the data, the models prescribed by scholarly publishers, and to some extent, the audience - primarily other researchers. This narrative, however, does not necessarily reflect the <em>process</em> of science –a process that produced the data in the first place.</p>

<p>A lot of what happens in science that ultimately leads to the “paper” takes the form of conversations around small tables, reading and reflections on the bus, or seemingly random thoughts on a sleepless night. We struggle with things we don’t understand. We seek advice from our colleagues or information in the published literature. We talk a lot – at lab meetings, conferences, holding a pipette over the bench, or while trying to figure out what that strange structure under the microscope is. That is the science happening. The article is what happens after all of that is done and dusted, and rarely, if ever, does it share what got us to that point.</p>
<p>There is no room in the scholarly article to capture that process. Yet, I’d like to argue, understanding this process is crucial for understanding science. The paper helps us get the knowledge. But the science lives in that messy and wonderful process. You can’t become a scientist by reading journal articles – you learn to be a scientist by <em>being </em>a scientist and participating in that array of human activities that form part of the cultural experience of science.</p>
<p>I am grateful to Penny for making me look at science as a human activity – not unlike writing a book, moulding a pot out of clay, or painting a landscape. And like these other activities, preserving the end product is easier than capturing the process. But unlike these other creators, we scientists are in the unique position of not directly profiting from the sales of our creative output. As Peter Suber eloquently puts it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“It’s enough to know that their employers pay them salaries, freeing them to give away their work, that they write for impact rather than money, and that they score career points when they make the kind of impact they hoped to make.”[1]</p>

<p>There is nothing in today’s technology that prevents us from freely sharing our findings. So why not start sharing more openly and broadly both the process and the final manuscripts? Why not make sure those articles can be preserved, used, re-used, mixed and mashed by institutions and individuals?</p>
<p>I say it is time to say goodbye to ‘publish or perish’ and time to say hello to ‘share or perish’.</p>

<h5>By Cameron Neylon</h5>
<p>[This post was originally published on Cameron Neylon's blog, <a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-challenge-for-scholarly-societies/" target="_blank">Science in the Open</a>, under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication</a>.]</p>
<p>With major governments signalling a shift to Open Access it seems like a good time to be asking which organisations in the scholarly communications space will survive the transition. It is likely that the major current publishers will survive, although relative market share and focus is likely to change. But the biggest challenges are faced by small to medium scholarly societies that depend on journal income for their current viability. What changes are necessary for them to navigate this transition and can they survive?</p>
<p>The fate of scholarly societies is one of the most contentious and even emotional in the open access landscape. Many researchers have strong emotional ties to their disciplinary societies and these societies often play a crucial role in supporting meetings, providing travel stipends to young researchers, awarding prizes, and representing the community. At the same time they face a peculiar bind. The money that supports these efforts often comes from journal subscriptions. Researchers are very attached to the benefits but seem disinclined to countenance membership fees that would support them. This problem is seen across many parts of the research enterprise – where researchers, or at least their institutions, are paying for services through subscriptions but unwilling to pay for them directly.</p>
<p>What options do societies have? Those with a large publication program could do worse in the short term than look very closely at the <a href="http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/News/PressReleases/2012/gold-for-gold-rsc-open-access.asp">announcement</a> from the UK <a title="Royal Society of Chemistry" href="http://www.rsc.org/" target="_blank">Royal Society of Chemistry</a> in July 2012. The RSC is offering an institutional mechanism whereby those institutions that have a particular level of subscription will receive an equivalent amount of publication services, set at the price of £1600 per paper. This is very clever for the RSC: it allows it to help institutions prepare effectively for changes in UK policy, it costs them nothing, and lets them experiment with a route to transition to full open access at relatively low risk. Because the contribution of UK institutions with this particular subscription plan is relatively small it is unlikely to reduce subscriptions significantly in the short term, but if and when it does it positions the RSC to offer package deals on publication services with very similar terms. Tactically by moving early it also allows the RSC to hold a higher price point than later movers will – and will help to increase its market share in the UK over that of the ACS.</p>
<p>Another route is for societies to explore the “indy band model”. Similar to bands that are trying to break through by giving away their recorded material but charging for live gigs, societies could focus on raising money through meetings rather than publications. Some societies already do this – having historically focussed on running large scale international or national meetings. The “in person” experience is something that cannot yet be done cheaply over the internet and “must attend” meetings offer significant income and sponsorship opportunities. There are challenges to be navigated here – ensuring commercial contributions don’t damage the brand or reduce the quality of meetings being a big one – but expect conference fees to rise as subscription incomes drop. Societies that currently run lavish meetings off the back of journal income will face a particular struggle over the next two to five years.</p>
<p>But even meetings are unlikely to offer a long term solution. It’s some way off yet but rising costs of travel and increasing quality of videoconferencing will start to eat into this market as well. If all the big speakers are dialling it in, is it still worth attending the meeting? So what are the real value offerings that societies can provide? What are the things that are unique to that community collection of expertise that no-one else can provide?</p>
<p>Peer review (pre-, post-, or peri-publication) is one of them. Publication services are not. Publication, in the narrow sense of “making public”, will be commoditised, if it hasn’t already. With new players like <a href="http://peerj.com/">PeerJ</a> and <a href="http://f1000research.com/">F1000 Research</a> alongside the now fairly familiar landscape of the wide-ranging <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PBinfield/ssp-presentation4">megajournal</a> the space for publication services to make fat profits is narrowing rapidly. This will, sooner or later, be a low margin business with a range of options to choose from when someone, whether a society or a single researcher, is looking for a platform to publish their work. While the rest of us may argue whether this will happen next year or in a decade, for societies it is the long term that matters, and in the long term commoditisation will happen.</p>
<p>The unique offering that a society brings is the <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/the-economics-of-scientific-collaboration/">aggregation and organisation of expert attention</a>. In a given space a scholarly society has a unique capacity to coordinate and organise assessment by domain experts. I can certainly imagine a society offering peer review as a core member service, independent of whether the thing being reviewed is already “published”. This might be a particular case where there are real benefits to operating a small scale – both because of the peer pressure for each member of the community to pull their weight and because the scale of the community lends itself to being understood and managed as a small set of partly connected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network">small world networks</a>. The question is really whether the sums add up. Will members pay $100 or $500 per year for peer review services? Would that provide enough income? What about younger members without grants? And perhaps crucially, how cheap would a separated publication platform have to be to make the sums look good?</p>
<p>Societies are all about community. Arguably most completely missed the boat on the potential of the social web when they could have built community hubs of real value – and those that didn’t miss it entirely largely created badly built and ill thought through community forums well after the first flush of failed generic “Facebook for Science” clones had faded. But another chance is coming. As the ratchet moves on funder and government open access policies, society journals stuck in a subscription model will become increasingly unattractive options for publication. The slow rate of progress and disciplinary differences will allow some to hold on past the point of no return and these societies will wither and die. Some societies will investigate transitional pricing models. I commend the example of the RSC to small societies as something to look at closely. Some may choose to move to publishing collections in larger journals where they retain editorial control. My bet is that those that survive will be the ones that find a way to make the combined expertise of the community pay – and I think the place to look for that will be those societies that find ways to decouple the value they offer through peer review from the costs of publication services.</p>

<h5>By Kathleen Fitzpatrick</h5>
<p>[This is an edited version of Kathleen's keynote address to the Modern Language Association conference in 2012. You can find the full speech at her website, <a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/giving-it-away/" target="_blank">Planned Obsolescence</a>.]</p>
<p>As you might guess from my title, this presentation focuses in large part on questions of open access as they might affect our thinking about the future of scholarly communication. “Open access,” I’m sure I don’t need to tell you, is a fraught concept among both scholars and publishers, one beset by a lot of misunderstandings, both intentional and unintentional.</p>
<p>Arguments circulate out there saying, for instance, that open access will open the floodgates to a lot of bad scholarship, when in fact open access publishing is perfectly compatible with peer review, and there are many OA journals that are more selective than their closed-access counterparts. There are folks who argue that open access is financially unsustainable, or even, as has been suggested by the recent proposal of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Works_Act">Research Works Act</a> in Congress, an unreasonable infringement on publisher income, when in fact a range of new models for open access publishing are coming into being, and several of the major commercial journal publishers have recently announced new OA ventures, which they of course would never do if they hadn’t found a business model in it somewhere. On the other hand, there are equally misguided convictions out there that open access publishing is free; clearly that’s not so. What I am hoping to do in this talk, however, is to shift our thinking about open access, for the moment, from a focus on <em>costs</em> to a focus on <em>values</em>, though without entirely leaving behind the overwhelming and at times quite grim economic realities by which we’re surrounded.</p>
<p>To begin, a bit of background: discussions of the possibilities for new open publishing models began online in the early 1990s, as a number of scientists and librarians recognized that the growth of the Internet made possible the free and open reproduction of scholarly literature. Stevan Harnad pushed these discussions into the open by submitting what he called a “subversive proposal” to an email list in June 1994, <a href="http://www.arl.org/sc/subversive/introduction-2.shtml" target="_blank">which was later described as pointing out</a> that “the scientific journal and the scholarly monograph are threatened by rising costs, rising output, and constrained academic budgets. The most painful paradox is that in the interests of science, the law of the market cannot be allowed to function. An item with a very small market may yet be the indispensable link in a chain of research that leads to a result of high social value.” One means of escaping this paradox, Harnad suggested, was the creation of globally accessible electronic self-deposit archives of scholarly articles – the foundation of today’s institutional and disciplinary repositories.</p>
<p>Over the years that followed Harnad’s provocation, the guiding principles of the open access movement began to be articulated, leading to the <a href="http://www.soros.org/openaccess">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a> published in 2002, which gave the movement its name. Following behind the Budapest initiative were the June 2003 <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/%7Epeters/fos/bethesda.htm">Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing</a> and the October 2003 <a href="http://oa.mpg.de/berlin-prozess/berliner-erklarung/">Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Scientific Knowledge</a>. Together, Budapest-Bethesda-Berlin defined the agenda for open access scholarly publishing.</p>
<p>The tenth anniversary of the Budapest Open Access Initiative is rapidly approaching; in the intervening decade, the open access movement spread through a dramatic increase in the number of OA journals (the “gold” model of open access), including the very public mass resignations of a number of editorial boards of closed-access journals, who then joined together to start new publications online. Additionally, the open access movement over the last decade was profoundly expanded through a growing number of institutional and disciplinary repositories (the “green” model of open access), as well as an increasing number of institution- and funder-based mandates requiring the deposit of the products of research done under their auspices. (It is of course those mandates that the Research Works Act seeks to attack.) By this past November, at Berlin 9, the ninth annual conference associated with the Berlin Declaration and the first to be held in the U.S., 34 North American signatories had endorsed the declaration and agreed to uphold its principles, including more than 20 colleges and universities. These signatories collectively produce a powerful demonstration of the expansion of U.S. commitment to facilitating open access, a commitment that can be seen at the national level in the recent White House Request for Information on Public Access to Digital Data and Scientific Publications.</p>
<p>Though these conversations, like the White House RFI, have to this point been overwhelmingly dominated by the sciences, the Berlin 9 conference took on as part of its focus this year the impact of open access on the humanities. While our fields bear certain interests in common with the sciences, there are a few important differences as well. The most obvious of these is a radical difference in funding systems and levels. Scientific research is all but impossible to conduct without large-scale grant funding, and scientists have long been able to write publishing costs into their grants. As a result, the business model for open access scientific publishing was relatively clear: shift from a reader-pays to an author-pays model. Easy-peasy. In the humanities, however, not only is the available funding generally too low to accommodate significant publishing charges to authors, but the vast majority of research is either supported by the scholar’s institution or is self-funded.</p>
<p>It’s for that reason that I’m not standing here suggesting that a large-scale transition of humanities publishing to an open access model would be easy; it wouldn’t. Humanities publishing faces a set of financial constraints that are daunting at the best of times, and crushing in times of economic retraction. As I argue in <em>Planned Obsolescence</em>, it is of course perfectly well possible to make scholarly publishing profitable; the Wileys and the Elseviers have certainly managed it, but they’ve done so at the direct expense of our universities. For not-for-profit scholarly publishers to follow the commercial publishers’ lead would for a range of reasons I explore in the book be a disaster. Those presses can’t be beaten at their own game, as the large conglomerates that operate them will always be able to conduct business more efficiently, and more ruthlessly, than the university should want to do. But nor can we simply hand over the business of scholarly publishing to them to operate; as John Thompson noted in <em>Books in the Digital Age</em>, in times of economic slowdown “commercial logic would tend to override any obligation [such companies] might feel to the scholarly community” (98), leaving nothing to stop them from eliminating academic publishing entirely, if it ceases to pay.</p>
<p>So we can’t beat them, and we can’t join them; what we can do is change the game entirely. And it’s for this reason that I want to argue that, despite the serious difficulties involved, a transition to open access publishing might be desirable – desirable enough that rather than ending our conversations with the seeming insurmountableness of the financial obstacles, we should instead start figuring out what it will to take to get around them.</p>
<p>One thing that makes open access publishing so desirable for the future of scholarly communication is the increased impact that openly distributed scholarship is able to have, and study after study shows that open-access literature – whether that published in “gold” OA journals or that deposited in “green” OA archives – is more cited than is work published in traditional closed venues. In addition to facilitating traditional researcher access, however, openly published work can also reach a much broader range of readers – students and instructors at undergraduate teaching institutions and at secondary schools, for instance, as well as folks who work outside academia entirely. Open-access scholarship has the potential to reach a broad spectrum of potentially interested publics.</p>
<p>We in the humanities often resist opening our work to these publics, fearing the consequences of such openness – and not without reason. The world at times fails to understand what we do, and, because our subject matter seems as though it ought to be comprehensible (you’re just writing about books, or movies, or art, after all!), isn’t inclined to wrestle with the difficulties that our work presents; their dismissive responses give us the clear sense that the public doesn’t take our work as seriously as, say, papers in high-energy physics, which few lay readers would assume their ability to comprehend without some background or training. As a result of these doubled misunderstandings, we close our work off from the public, arguing that we’re only writing for a small group of specialists anyhow. In which case, why would open access matter?</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that the more we close our work away from the public, and the more we refuse to engage in dialogue across the boundaries of the academy, the more we undermine that public’s willingness to fund our research and our institutions. As Kathy Woodward put it so brilliantly on Friday, the major crisis facing the funding of higher education is an increasingly widespread conviction that education is a private responsibility rather than a public good; we wind up strengthening that conviction when we treat our work as private, by keeping it to ourselves. Closing our work away from non-scholarly readers, and keeping our conversations private, might protect us from public criticism, but it can’t protect us from public apathy, a condition that is, in the current economy, far more dangerous. This is not to say that such openness doesn’t bear risks, particularly for scholars working in controversial areas of research, but it is to say that only through open dialogue across the walls of the ivory tower will we have any chance of convincing the broader public, including our governmental funding bodies, of the importance of our work. And let me say this clearly:  increasing the discoverability of scholarly work on the web, making it available to a broader readership, is a Good Thing, not just for the individual scholar but for the field in which she works.  The more that well-researched, thoughtful scholarship on contemporary cultural issues is available to, for instance, journalists covering those issues for popular venues, the richer the discourse in those publications will become – increasing, not incidentally, the visibility of institutions of higher education, and their importance to the culture at large.</p>
<p>Publishing is never free, of course; it either costs us in dollars or in labor (and often both), and sustainability in scholarly publishing has often been equated with the need to produce revenue based on the sale of publishing’s products. As I’ve argued at length, however, the current system of scholarly publishing is already not sustainable for most not-for-profit organizations, and some of the ostensible solutions – such as handing journals over to the commercial publishers who seem to have found a viable profit model – are only making things worse. One might see here the cautionary tale of a fellow humanities scholarly organization that, facing a budgetary crisis, contracted with a commercial publisher to distribute its journals. That organization received a nice bit of income in the short term – but the commercial publisher involved immediately more than doubled the institutional subscription fees for the journals involved, ensuring that more libraries would be forced not to carry those journals, and thus reducing the potential impact of the work published in them. And needless to say, however much the organization involved earned in this exchange, the corporate publisher earned more.</p>
<p>So rather than giving our work away to corporate entities that will profit at our expense, might we instead find a way to make a virtue of our market failures? What if we understood sustainability not as the ability to produce revenue, but the ability to keep the engine of generosity running? What if we were to allow the engine of generosity on which so much of the enterprise runs to affect the final point of distribution, if we were to embrace the gift economy of scholarly communication and make a gift of our work to others? What might happen if outreach, generosity, giving it away were our primary values?</p>
<p>Donald Hall has argued that the future viability of higher education requires that we collectively reclaim the intellectual growth fostered in the academy as a public good rather than a private responsibility. If we ask this of our institutions, and our funders, we must also ask it of ourselves.</p>
<p>There are financial realities that must be acknowledged in all of this, and I don’t want to minimize the difficulties of grappling with them. But in all such discussion about such financial realities, I cannot help but remember something Michael Jensen of the National Academies Press once told me. The NAP makes all of its publications freely and openly available on the web, producing revenue by selling print versions of that content. Admittedly, NAP has probably lost revenue that it could have obtained if it had refrained from giving the work it publishes away online – but it has gained significantly in visibility, in discoverability, and in goodwill. As Jensen said, when I asked him about this model, the press’s mandate is to make as much of its work available as freely and openly as it can while still breaking even. And this is the ethos that I would love to see become the guiding principle for scholarly communication more generally.</p>
<p>How much can we make freely and openly available in this fashion? How might we reimagine the production of revenue in scholarly communication from a basis in the sale of content to a basis in the provision of services? How can we work together to reorient our perspective from <em>costs</em> to <em>values</em>? How might openness allow us to better engage not just with one another but with the world around us, treating that world not just as an object laid open to our masterful scrutiny, but instead as a complex conglomeration of agents both able and entitled to enter into conversation with us? What if we were to recognize that the only way to hold onto the knowledge we have – and to help higher education and the communities within which we work to thrive – is to give it away?</p>

<p dir="LTR">With OER, the marginal cost of replicating digital learning materials is near zero and sharing development costs improves cost efficiencies. Consequently, an international <strong>network</strong> of <strong>accredited institutions</strong> would be able to leverage <strong>significant savings</strong> in the cost and time required for the assembly and maintenance of OER courses combined with significant efficiency gains when <strong>operating at scale. </strong>Moreover<strong>, </strong>OER provides a viable solution for education institutions to respond to their educational mission of social inclusion.</p>

<p>The scale is guaranteed because of the unsatisfied global demand for higher education. Researchers at UNESCO and the Commonwealth of Learning conservatively predict that over the next fifteen years, the post-secondary education system will need to provide for an additional 100 million places. The conventional model of higher education provision is simply not able to respond to this level of demand for education.</p>
<p>The confluence of these economic and digital technology enablers provide fertile ground for designing a <strong>sustainable open education ecosystem</strong> whereby institutions can provide free access to learning opportunities. Building on Professor Emeritus Jim Taylor's 2007 ideas to <a title="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/e-jist/docs/vol10_no1/papers/full_papers/taylorj.htm" href="http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/e-jist/docs/vol10_no1/papers/full_papers/taylorj.htm" rel="nofollow">provide assessment on demand</a>, the OERu concept was conceived.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/OER-University-concept.png"><img class="aligncenter" title="OER-University-concept" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/OER-University-concept.png" alt="" width="463" height="348"></a></p>
<p>Individuals are free to learn from digital materials hosted on the open web. The problem is that learners who access digital OERs on the web and acquire knowledge and skills either formally or informally, alone or in groups, cannot readily have their learning assessed and subsequently receive appropriate academic recognition for their efforts.</p>
<p>OERu learners will gain <strong>free access to high quality courses</strong> that are designed for independent-study using <strong>OER</strong>. OERu learners will receive student support through a global network of volunteers and peer support using social software technologies. Students can be <strong>assessed for a fee</strong> by participating institutions and earn a <strong>credible credential. </strong>Using OER<strong> </strong>it is possible to build a parallel learning universe to provide more affordable education for learners currently excluded from the formal education sector.</p>

<p>With a healthy dose of our Kiwi “can do” attitude which favours pragmatism above pretence, in November 2011, the OER Foundation convened an open meeting of <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" rel="nofollow">founding anchor partners</a> to plan the practical implementation of the OERu. With funding support from UNESCO, this <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_OERu_Meeting_summary" rel="nofollow">landmark meeting </a>was streamed live on the Internet modelling open participation and collaboration on a global scale. Five tertiary education institutions in New Zealand have embraced their responsibility to ensure more sustainable education futures, by joining the OERu network as <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_Founding_OERTen_anchor_partner_statements" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/2011.11_Founding_OERTen_anchor_partner_statements" rel="nofollow">founding anchor partners</a>. Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology, NorthTec the Open Polytechnic, Otago Polytechnic and the University of Canterbury are the New Zealand institutions who are leading open education futures in New Zealand. The <a title="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" rel="nofollow">OERu</a> network, now numbering 20 contributing institutions will be able to accredit OER learning on five continents mapped to the credentialing frameworks of 20 different countries.</p>
<p dir="LTR">The vision of the OERu collaboration has now turned into reality with the <a title="http://wikieducator.org/Australia's_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" rel="nofollow">recent </a><a title="http://wikieducator.org/Australia's_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> of the the launch of the first OERu course,  <a title="http://wikieducator.org/AST1000" href="http://wikieducator.org/AST1000" rel="nofollow">Regional Relations in Asia and the Pacific</a> (AST1000) developed by the University of Southern Queensland.

<p>University leaders and administrators are concerned with how to ensure sustainability of OER initiatives on campus. Indeed, if OER projects are managed as an add-on to existing operations, the sources of funding to sustain OER projects can be a challenge. However, the strategic solution is to embed OER development as an integral component of business as usual.</p>
<p>From an investment-decision perspective, participation in the OERu <strong>does not require new money</strong>, but rather a reallocation of existing staff time to releasing selected development outputs under open content licenses for the OERu network as part of mainstream operations. The OERu model anticipates that no more than 1% of existing budget time would be required for release under open content licenses. The institutional costs of assessment and credentialisation services are recouped on a <strong>cost-recovery basis</strong> from student fees and/or other sources.</p>
<p>Consider for example that the average tuition fees for a 4-year bachelor degree at a public university in the United States is US$26,312, excluding accommodation and textbook costs. At Otago Polytechnic, the full tuition cost of a 4-year degree equivalent is approximately US$19,452. The summative assessment and credentialing services for the first OERu prototype course would equate to a 4-year bachelor degree costing US$6,759. As the OERu network grows and begins to leverage economies of scale, it is feasible that further cost reductions can be implemented.</p>
<p>The OERu network has succeeded in shifting the strategic focus of open education from how to achieve sustainable OER projects to how institutions will remain sustainable without the mainstream adoption of OER.</p>
<p>The OERu model is inspired by the concept of “<em>smart philanthropy</em>”. While the OERu is primarily designed to widen access to learning in higher education through the social inclusion and community service agenda, our approach encourages member institutions to reintegrate the lessons learned into mainstream operations. Tacit knowledge and capability gained through the OERu's open design and development model can be reinvested back into the core business operations to improve effectiveness of the higher education sector and generate new business opportunities now possible with the OERu model. The OERu network is an exemplar for low cost, low risk, but high impact innovation.</p>

<p>Partnering with the Royal Society of New Zealand in the publication of the Society’s eight journals, Taylor &amp; Francis’ goal is to maximize access to and discoverability of the quality research published within the journals. We have a dedicated publishing office in Melbourne, supporting our ANZ-based editors, society officers, libraries and authors on local time.</p>
<p>One of the most important elements of Taylor &amp; Francis’ objectives as a major international publisher is to work towards the goal of broad-based access to content, through our program of the sustainable publication of Open Access (OA) journals, hybrid titles and subscription-based journals.</p>
<p>In the Open Access arena our goal is one of providing the highest levels of service, quality publication and maximum flexibility, enabling OA publication through development of a range of publishing and access models and through the provision of a range of licensing options to our author communities.</p>
<p>We support authors in fulfilling funder requirements, such as the US National Institutions of Health (NIH) mandate, through content feeds of author ‘second-stage manuscripts’ (post-peer review) for them to load into their repositories, such as PubMedCentral. These feeds are also designed to help authors as we are able to undertake the mandated online posting on their behalf. We have recently reached agreement with The World Bank for deposit of their author manuscripts into their open repository, in the fields of economics and finance.</p>
<p>[quote style="boxed" float="right"]Taylor &amp; Francis now publish 17 pure OA journals.[/quote]</p>
<p>Authors across all our journals globally have the right to post their manuscripts in Open repositories, after the respective embargo period has passed (12 months for Science &amp; Technology, and 18 months for Social Sciences, Arts &amp; Humanities titles). We are experimenting in the field of Library and Information Science with a ‘zero embargo’ pilot policy whereby authors have the right to post immediately on publication in an Open repository.</p>
<p>We are working hard to engage with funders to ensure that we as Publisher, our publishing partners and our journal authors are fully compliant with mandates. At the same time our objective is to make the publishing process as problem-free as possible for our authors, editors and learned societies/journal proprietors, by offering support and guidance at all stages of the publishing process, and by offering choice to authors with regard to the nature of their publication licensing.</p>
<p>We now publish 17 pure OA journals which are branded as Taylor &amp; Francis Open and are based on the “gold” OA (or ‘author pays’) Article Publishing Charge (APC) model. We feel strongly that authors should not be prevented from publishing in these journals should they not have the means available to cover the APC, hence fee waivers are available to authors from developing countries. For our T&amp;F-owned proprietary Open titles, and titles where our society partners adopt this policy, we will be asking authors to sign the Creative Commons Attribution license (known as CC-BY), which allows for unlimited reuse, adaptation, translation, and so on of article content, provided that the work is attributed by any subsequent user. This license complies with the Research Councils UK (RCUK) and Wellcome Trust mandates, as authors in receipt of a grant from the Trust, RCUK, or one of RCUK’s constituents, must publish under this license. More information can be found on <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">the Creative Commons website</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2006 we have also provided the option on subscription-based journals for authors to make their article fully open access on publication upon payment of an APC fee. We support the recent <a href="http://www.stm-assoc.org/publishers-support-sustainable-open-access/" target="_blank">STM statement on Open Access</a>, which states that: “We believe that authors should be able to publish in the journal of their choice, where publication will have the greatest potential to advance their field”. In order to facilitate this choice, from 2013, we plan to implement the T&amp;F Open Select (“Gold OA”) facility across the majority of our journals.</p>
<p>In the OA arena, and particularly when it comes to APC models, we are keenly aware of our need to provide the best levels of service and care for our author communities. We continue to work on enhancing processes, systems and turnaround times for authors, providing a state-of –the-art online platform to maximize discoverability, supplying article metrics to offer maximum transparency, as well as undertaking extensive marketing campaigns for driving usage and impact. This is in conjunction with the development of our author services more widely, as detailed on <a href="http://journalauthors.tandf.co.uk/" target="_blank">our Author Services website</a>.</p>
