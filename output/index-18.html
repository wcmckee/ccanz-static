<h5>By Dr Danny Kingsley</h5>
<p>This has been a big year for open access around the world, and developments in Australia have moved apace.</p>
<p>Two things happened on the first of January 2013 – the Australian Research Council (ARC) announced their <a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/applicants/open_access.htm" target="_blank">open access policy</a> and the <a href="http://aoasg.org.au" target="_blank">Australian Open Access Support Group</a> (AOASG) began operations (disclaimer – I work as the Executive Officer for the AOASG).</p>
<h5>Funding policies</h5>

<p>The ARC policy is very similar to the <a href="http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/grants/policy/dissemination-research-findings" target="_blank">policy</a> introduced on 1 July 2012 by the Australia’s other government funding body – the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/resources/comparison-of-arc-nhmrc-policies/" target="_blank">Both policies require</a> that the Chief Investigators for funded projects should add metadata about their publications to their institutional repositories at the time of acceptance. There should be a link to the open access version within 12 months of publication. Neither policy advocates a particular method of achieving open access, and both policies specifically do not require payment for open access. However both organisations allow use of grant funding to pay for publication.</p>
<p>These policies stand out because they specifically look to use the established infrastructure in Australia. All Australian universities, (and many other institutions) have <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/open-access-repositories-at-australian-institutions/." target="_blank">established an institutional repository</a>  Generally to date Australia has enjoyed strong <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/2013/03/19/centrally-supported-open-access-initiatives-in-australia/" target="_blank">commitment and support from the government</a> to develop infrastructure for open access.</p>
<p>At an Open Access Week event organised by the AOASG, the CEOs of both the ARC and the NHMRC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kcj8j3LyBQ" target="_blank">spoke about these policies.</a> They noted that given the speed of change in scholarly communication it is almost impossible to know what the open access agenda will look like in five years time. For this reason neither the NHMRC nor the ARC wish to be prescriptive about how to implement their policies. They did note that while there are no current plans to withhold future grants from researchers that do not comply with the policies, this could become the case into the future.</p>
<h5>Events and activities</h5>

<p>That was one of many <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/oawk-events-2013/" target="_blank">OAWk events</a> being held in Australia in 2013, which has shaped up to be the largest yet. Every state and territory is hosting events with more than half the country’s universities participating.</p>
<p>The week following OAWk will see a large open access-themed conference – the <a href="http://www.oar2013.qut.edu.au" target="_blank">Open Access and Research Conference</a> held at QUT from 30 October to 1 November. This event will feature many high-profile international speakers.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2013 the <a href="http://www.humanities.org.au/About/AlliedOrganisations/NationalScholarlyCommunicationsForum.aspx" target="_blank">National Scholarly Communication Forum</a> was held, addressing the topic “Open Access Research Issues in the Humanities and Social Sciences”. A full run down of the presentations, themes and readings is <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/2013/05/16/notes-from-the-national-scholarly-communication-forum-may-3-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Informing the discussion</h5>

<p>Throughout the year the AOASG has worked towards its goal of informing and encouraging the discussion around open access. The primary output of the group has been the development of the AOASG webpage. This consists of a combination of information about open access specific to Australia, links to useful resources, and discussion points about events in the open access space both in Australia and overseas.</p>
<p>The site has had over 26,000 visitors since going live in February. An analysis of page statistics indicates a strong interest in practitioner issues. The most popular blog has been “<a href="http://aoasg.org.au/2013/04/10/so-you-want-people-to-read-your-thesis/" target="_blank">So you want people to read your thesis?</a>”, followed by “<a href="http://aoasg.org.au/2013/03/25/journal-editors-take-note-you-have-the-power/" target="_blank">Journal editors take note – you have the power</a>". The most popular webpage (apart from the homepage) is the <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/open-access-in-action/australian-oa-journals/" target="_blank">list of Australian OA journals</a>. The website also contains several graphics including <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/how-to-make-research-oa/" target="_blank">posters</a> and <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/resources/policy-compliance-decision-tree/" target="_blank">flowcharts</a> that are available for download under CC-BY license.</p>
<p>The Australian and New Zealand repository community has been fortunate to have a strong community of practice which developed over several years through discussion lists and community days organised through the CAUL Australasian Institutional Repository Support Service (CAIRSS). While CAIRSS no longer exists, the Council of Australian University Librarians (<a href="http://www.caul.edu.au" target="_blank">CAUL</a>) has continued to support these important services.</p>
<p>To complement this community, AOASG started the <a href="http://mailman.anu.edu.au/mailman/listinfo/australian_oa_community" target="_blank">Australian Open Access Community Discussion List</a> which pleasingly has had a strong uptake. Over 200 people have joined the list, representing a wide range of backgrounds. While 72% of the members are library-associated, a significant number of these are from research institutions outside the university sector. We have a positive interest from researchers, with many joining the list. There has also been some international interest – with members from India, Japan and Singapore plus several from New Zealand.</p>
<p>Twitter has been a very useful way to share the vast amount of developments, publications, policies and resources that are part of the open access area. The Twitter feed @openaccess_oz has sent over 1,200 notifications during the year. Followers come from all over the world.</p>
<p>Possibly the most positive sign for open access in Australia is the increasing number of policies in institutions. The AOASG began with representatives from six universities with open access policies. During the year more have been announced and it is anticipated that others are intending to during or around OAWk. There is a full list of Australian OA policies <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/resources/" target="_blank">here</a>. The AOASG is looking to expand its membership for 2014, which is shaping to be an even bigger year for open access in Australia.</p>

<a href="posts/2013/10/16/review-of-the-performance-based-research-fund.html" class="u-url">Review of the Performance-Based Research Fund</a>
             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2013-10-16T10:16:08+13:00">2013-10-16 10:16</time>
</h1>
        <div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Following the 2012 round of the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF), the Ministry of Education, alongside the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Tertiary Education Commission, decided to review the PBRF, to see whether the fund is achieving its aims.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of this review was a process of public consultation, including a general call for feedback, which closed on 4 October. As part of our work supporting open access and open licensing for scholarly research, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand decided to submit.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The submission below is based on a series of questions posed by the review panel, in relation to a consultation document, which you can read at the <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/NZEducation/EducationPolicies/TertiaryEducation/PolicyAndStrategy/PBRFReview.aspx" target="_blank">PBRF Review page</a>. Some of the questions are rather specific, so if you're only interested in CCANZ's general position, focus on the first and last question.</p>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-0474893a-bdd4-9b88-1809-04d3465ce95a" style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1. Do the proposed objectives provide a clear statement of the Government’s expectations for the PBRF? What are the key advantages or disadvantages of the proposed objectives?</strong></span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand welcomes the Government’s recognition of the wider public benefits of excellence in research, including “provid[ing] economic, social, cultural, and environmental benefits to New Zealand” and “support[ing] commercialisation of research and technology transfer to New Zealand businesses and organisations.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">On their own, however, these objectives do not specifically incentivise the free transfer of knowledge from the research sector to other individuals and organisations — whether across or beyond the research sector itself.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The need for such incentives is clear. At present, most publicly funded research is not freely available for reuse by the organisations and individuals that need it. In fact, most publicly funded research — including journal articles and research data — is made available under prohibitively expensive pay-walls; even if organisations pay to access the research, it is usually restricted by all rights reserved copyright, which means that it cannot be freely reused.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The net result of the closure of academic research outputs is that the potential benefits cited above, which constitute the underlying purpose of public investment in funding research, will not be realised, regardless of whether the quality of New Zealand research outputs continues to increase.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The closure of academic research produces inefficiencies across the economy, as research is either unnecessarily duplicated or its social and economic potential is not fully realised. The inaccessibility of New Zealand research also restricts the reputational benefits of increased citations and visibility to the wider public.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We recommend that the PBRF objectives encourage the broad and free dissemination of openly licensed research to the individuals and organisations that can more effectively exploit its findings.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>5. In your view, would redefining PBRF-eligible External Research Income to include commercialisation income earned from research outputs encourage individual researchers and tertiary education organisations to seek more commercialisation income?</strong></span></p>

<p dir="ltr">We recommend that the Government defines commercialisation in the broadest possible sense. While there has been an international trend towards direct commercialisation by researchers and research institutions — with the attendant commercial income — the potential commercial benefits of New Zealand’s publicly funded research are much broader than commercialisation income on its own would suggest.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If commercialisation is to be recognised in the PBRF, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand recommends that commercialisation that does not provide direct income to the university or researcher be included. As the New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework already recognises, and as the rise of local businesses built on openly licensed government data and information proves, there is enormous potential for individuals and organisations in New Zealand to make efficiencies and innovate on publicly funded copyright material, if that material is made freely accessible.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If the intention of the PBRF is to increase activity across the economy, then we recommend that it incentivise the open dissemination of research, to give all New Zealand individuals and companies the ability to innovate from it.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">6. What are the benefits and risks for tertiary education organisations, teaching and research staff, and research end users of redefining PBRF-eligible External Research Income to include commercialisation income earned from research outputs?</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">There is a risk that, unless the PBRF include a provision incentivising the free dissemination of openly licensed research outputs, the redefinition of eligible research outputs to include commercialisation income — and not commercialisation by New Zealand companies that do not provide a direct payment to the researcher or institution — will have the perverse effect of closing off New Zealand research to the companies that helped to pay for its production. We would also recommend that the PBRF include examples of reuse by non-profit organisations, as the activities of these organisations may also lead to downstream increases in productivity.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">7. In your view, would placing a weighting on External Research Income received from non-government sources encourage researchers and tertiary education organisations to seek out research funding from industry, iwi and other community sources?</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">8. What are the benefits and risks for tertiary education organisations and teaching and research staff of requiring reporting of PBRF-eligible External Research Income by source and placing a weighting on External Research Income received from non-government sources?</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">While it is important that researchers seek external funding, it is essential that research outputs remain accessible to the wider New Zealand public, including commercial organisations that are better suited to benefit from those research outputs. While Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand accepts that some commercial arrangements will require restrictive IP arrangements, we wish to emphasise that public funding remains a core part of most New Zealand research outputs, even when it is partially sourced from elsewhere.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We believe that incentives for open access and open licensing are necessary to ensure that the Government’s current recommendations do not incentivise more restrictions being placed on New Zealand’s publicly funded research, which would in turn only serve to restrict full exploitation of the research outputs in the private sector. This would, as stated above, have the perverse effect of reducing the capacity of New Zealand organisations to realise the economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits of high quality New Zealand research.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">11. In your view, would reducing the number of examples of Peer Esteem and Contribution to the Research Environment significantly reduce the amount of time spent by teaching and research staff and tertiary education organisations preparing Evidence Portfolios, while still providing sufficient information to allow for robust assessment?</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">12. In your view, would the introduction of a single Research Contribution component, together with more explicit guidelines, improve recognition of research contribution outside of academia within the Quality Evaluation?</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">While we accept the need to reduce the burden PBRF places on researchers and institutions, we wish to emphasise the need for the PBRF to prioritise the wider economic, social, cultural and environmental benefits of high quality research. Any proposed changes to the reporting structure should also include incentives for researchers to show the realisation of these wider benefits — including the innovative reuse of research by individuals and organisations outside of the academy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For this reason, we recommend that the PBRF include specific guidelines for researchers to actively and openly disseminate their research to the public, including individuals, companies, community groups and other non-government organisations.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">13. What are the benefits and risks for tertiary education organisations and teaching and research staff of removing the special circumstances provisions from the Quality Evaluation?</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The removal of the special circumstances provision may discourage researchers from engaging in public outreach activities that help realise economic, social, cultural and environmental outcomes. For this reason, we recommend that the current provision be kept.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">20. Is there any other feedback you would like to provide on the consultation document?</span></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand welcomes the Government’s efforts to improve the efficacy of the PBRF. As the PBRF’s proposed objectives suggest, excellence in research is essential to New Zealand’s cultural, social, economic and environmental future, and it is appropriate that Government research funding bodies provide incentives to ensure that the benefits of funded research are realised.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We believe that these benefits can only be realised when New Zealand’s publicly funded research — including journals articles, research data and research tools — is freely accessible to the organisations and individuals that fund it. Specifically, we recommend that the PBRF incentivise the publication of research in open access journals and repositories, under an open licence that allows for broad dissemination and commercial and non-commercial reuse, following the precedents set by the NZGOAL framework for government data and information and many other funding bodies overseas, such as the National Institute of Health in the USA and the Wellcome Trust in the UK.</p>

<p>In closing, CCANZ also notes that New Zealand is a signatory to the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/science/sci-tech/sciencetechnologyandinnovationforthe21stcenturymeetingoftheoecdcommitteeforscientificandtechnologicalpolicyatministeriallevel29-30january2004-finalcommunique.htm" target="_blank">OECD Declaration on Access to Research Data from Public Funding</a>, which recognises “an optimum international exchange of data, information and knowledge contributes decisively to the advancement of scientific research and innovation.” Other relevant international agreements include the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/what-is-the-paris-oer-declaration/" target="_blank">UNESCO Paris Open Educational Resources Declaration</a>, which recommends that States “encourage the open licensing of educational materials produced with public funds.”</p>

        <div>
<p></p>
<em>Recently, I was lucky enough to travel to Buenos Aires to take part in the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2013" target="_blank">Creative Commons Global Summit</a>, which was attended by over 250 delegates from 80 countries. This is the first in a series of posts summarising and reflecting on some of the issues that were raised during the Summit. </em>
<p><em><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ccsum-700.png"><img class="alignright" title="Ccsum-700" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Ccsum-700-300x74.png" alt="" width="300" height="74"></a></em></p>
<h5>Background: The 2nd Global Conference on IP and the Public Interest</h5>

<p>Let’s begin with some background: In 2012, a heap of Creative Commons affiliates attended the <a href="http://www.global-congress.org/" target="_blank">2nd Global Congress on Intellectual Property and the Public Interest</a> in Rio de Janeiro, an event aimed at building a broad network of scholars and advocates to promote IP policy reform. In fact, as Creative Commons Netherlands Public Lead Paul Keller writes<a href="http://www.kennisland.nl/filter/nieuws/creative-commons-en-de-modernisering-van-het-auteursrecht" target="_blank"> in his blog post at Kennisland</a>, “Creative Commons affiliate teams formed the biggest contingent of participants from a single community there."</p>
<p>This should come as no surprise. As a community, Creative Commons affiliates are involved with a broad range of public interest projects, including open government, open education, open cultural heritage, open science -- and, as it happens, copyright reform.</p>
<p>The problem is that Creative Commons affiliates don't tend to advocate for copyright reform <em>as</em> Creative Commons affiliates. In fact, many affiliates feel as if they have to preface any public statement for reform -- even pragmatic statements against copyright extension or for broad fair use provisions -- by stating that they do not speak 'for' their respective Creative Commons project.</p>
<p>This meant that despite being the largest community at the conference, "we did not have a position on what we were doing there as Creative Commons."</p>
<h5>The Status Quo</h5>

<p>"I cannot count," Paul writes, "how often I have prefaced contributions to discussions by stating that 'I am not making this point with my CC hat on.'" This sounds like -- and is -- a technicality, though it's a technicality that allows the global Creative Commons project to focus on its core role: that is, to act as a steward for the global commons.</p>
<p>The concern for many is that CC's participation in copyright reform would weaken its capacity to work with public agencies to open up publicly funded copyright works. This, as it happens, is the core work of just about every Creative Commons project on the planet.</p>
<p>The other core issue is that Creative Commons HQ, under the US tax code, is not allowed to engage in lobbying activities. While CC affiliates are not bound by this restriction, the general wariness against participating in activities that could be construed as 'lobbying' remains.</p>
<p>The debate continues. However, many affiliates agree that the drive for a 'global commons'<em>  </em>and the drive for copyright reform are one and the same, and that it no longer makes sense to separate the two.</p>
<h5>Copyright Reform at the Creative Commons Global Summit</h5>

<p>In order to solicit a broad discussion on the issue, Paul Keller, along with CCHQ and other leading Creative Commons affiliates, organised a mini-conference before the official CC Summit proceedings. Expecting around two dozen people to sign-up, the 'mini-conference' swelled to over 100 attendees, with representatives from most CC affiliates and many related organisations, such as Wikimedia, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Open Knowledge Foundation and the Public Library of Science.  <em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Opening the copyright reform meeting, Paul articulated two compelling reasons for the Creative Commons community to engage in reform activities, both of which were echoed by many other affiliate organisations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many affiliates have noticed anti-reform lobbyists using the success of Creative Commons as an argument <em>against</em> copyright reform. In essence, this argument goes something like, 'Creative Commons is a success, therefore we should make copyright more restrictive.' At the very least, Creative Commons needs to clarify that it does not support this argument.</li>

    <li>There are many different routes to a richer, more vibrant commons, and for some materials, Creative Commons is not the most appropriate route to take. Paul refers to <a href="http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2013/article_0017.html" target="_blank">the recent WIPO treaty for the visually impaired</a>, which was a victory for the commons, but not a victory that would have been won by advocating for open licensing. You can read a Paul's argument <a href="http://www.kennisland.nl/filter/nieuws/creative-commons-en-de-modernisering-van-het-auteursrecht" target="_blank">in full here</a>.</li>

</ol>

<p>This should come as no surprise. As a community, <em>Recently, I was lucky enough to travel to Buenos Aires to take part in the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2013" target="_blank">Creative Commons Global Summit</a>, which was attended by over 250 delegates from 80 countries. This is the first in a series of posts summarising and reflecting on some of the issues that were raised during the Summit. </em></p>
<h5>Background: The 2nd Global Conference on IP and the Public Interest</h5>

<p>Let’s begin with some background: In 2012, a heap of Creative Commons affiliates attended the <a href="http://www.global-congress.org/" target="_blank">2nd Global Congress on Intellectual Property and the Public Interest</a> in Rio de Janeiro, an event aimed at building a broad network of scholars and advocates to promote IP policy reform. In fact, as Creative Commons Netherlands Public Lead Paul Keller writes<a href="http://www.kennisland.nl/filter/nieuws/creative-commons-en-de-modernisering-van-het-auteursrecht" target="_blank"> in his blog post at Kennisland</a>, “Creative Commons affiliate teams formed the biggest contingent of participants from a single community there."</p>
<p>This should come as no surprise. As a community, Creative Commons affiliates are involved with a broad range of public interest projects, including open government, open education, open cultural heritage, open science -- and, as it happens, copyright reform.</p>
<p>The problem is that Creative Commons affiliates don't tend to advocate for copyright reform <em>as</em> Creative Commons affiliates. In fact, many affiliates feel as if they have to preface any public statement for reform -- even pragmatic statements against copyright extension or for broad fair use provisions -- by stating that they do not speak 'for' their respective Creative Commons project.</p>
<p>This meant that despite being the largest community at the conference, "we did not have a position on what we were doing there as Creative Commons."</p>
<h5>The Status Quo</h5>

<p>"I cannot count," Paul writes, "how often I have prefaced contributions to discussions by stating that 'I am not making this point with my CC hat on.'" This sounds like -- and is -- a technicality, though it's a technicality that allows the global Creative Commons project to focus on its core role: that is, to act as a steward for the global commons.</p>
<p>The concern for many is that CC's participation in copyright reform would weaken its capacity to work with public agencies to open up publicly funded copyright works. This, as it happens, is the core work of just about every Creative Commons project on the planet.</p>
<p>The other core issue is that Creative Commons HQ, under the US tax code, is not allowed to engage in lobbying activities. While CC affiliates are not bound by this restriction, the general wariness against participating in activities that could be construed as 'lobbying' remains.</p>
<p>The debate continues. However, many affiliates agree that the drive for a 'global commons'and the drive for copyright reform are one and the same, and that it no longer makes sense to separate the two.</p>
<h5>Copyright Reform at the Creative Commons Global Summit</h5>

<p>In order to solicit a broad discussion on the issue, Paul Keller, along with CCHQ and other leading Creative Commons affiliates, organised a mini-conference before the official CC Summit proceedings. Expecting around two dozen people to sign-up, the 'mini-conference' swelled to over 100 attendees, with representatives from most CC affiliates and many related organisations, such as Wikimedia, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Open Knowledge Foundation and the Public Library of Science. <em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Opening the copyright reform meeting, Paul articulated two compelling reasons for the Creative Commons community to engage in reform activities, both of which were echoed by many other affiliate organisations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many affiliates have noticed anti-reform lobbyists using the success of Creative Commons as an argument <em>against</em> copyright reform. In essence, this argument goes something like, 'Creative Commons is a success, therefore we should make copyright more restrictive.' At the very least, Creative Commons needs to clarify that it does not support this argument.</li>

    <li>There are many different routes to a richer, more vibrant commons, and for some materials, Creative Commons is not the most appropriate route to take. Paul refers to <a href="http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2013/article_0017.html" target="_blank">the recent WIPO treaty for the visually impaired</a>, which was a victory for the commons, but not a victory that would have been won by advocating for open licensing. You can read a Paul's argument <a href="http://www.kennisland.nl/filter/nieuws/creative-commons-en-de-modernisering-van-het-auteursrecht" target="_blank">in full here</a>.</li>

</ol>
<p>While there was general agreement about the need for CCHQ to clarify its position, it was clear that each CC affiliate was going to have to navigate these waters for itself, according to its local challenges and opportunities -- including, of course, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>

<p><em>In June 2011, Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) launched the </em><a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/"><em>LINZ Data Service</em></a><em> (LDS), a web-based tool which allows users to map and download LINZ data. LDS licences most of its data under a </em><a href="http://http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"><em>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>We sat down and had a chat with Manager Jeremy Palmer and Planning and Support Advisor Vicki Lindsay to talk about where the LDS came from, what it’s currently doing, and where it might be headed in the future.</em></p>
<p>LDS was born, Jeremy says, out of the need to do two things: “first, to drive innovation in the private sector to get better reuse of our data, and second, to drive efficiencies within government agencies.” One of the operation’s key requirements, Jeremy says, was the open licensing of data.</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://nzgoal.info/">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing</a> (NZGOAL) framework, deciding to license with Creative Commons was a relatively simple process. “We brought NZGOAL into the equation early on, which allowed us to analyse our methods of licensing—previously, each dataset had its own terms, conditions and restrictions based on various levels of complex copyright.”</p>
<p>"We concluded pretty quickly that we could relicense most of our datasets under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licences—bar a few which have legal restrictions on them.”</p>
<p>Vicki described the LDS experience as a “bit of a test pilot” for the implementation of the NZGOAL framework. “It was really good for us because we didn’t need to develop any licences, but could adopt a licence recognised both nationally and internationally.”</p>
<p>LINZ’s Chief Executive at the time, Colin MacDonald, was intimately involved in the cross-government programme for data and information re-use. The adoption of the NZGOAL framework was strategic decision on LINZ’s part - an opportunity for LINZ to show leadership in the open data space. Jeremy says that stakeholders and partners that contributed to the design of the service would also chip in with advice: “we were working in partnership with <a href="http://koordinates.com/">Koordinates</a>, who provided the technology for LDS and who are heavily involved in the open data movement.”</p>
<p>Before the launch of the LDS, access to LINZ datasets was primarily done through manual requests and provided on DVDs—a “labour-intensive” and time consuming process. While some of these ‘legacy services’ are running alongside the LDS currently, Vicki notes they will be streamlined into the LDS in the long term. As with any major change in service delivery, the transition can take time to negotiate.</p>
<p>But Jeremy says the change has been for the best: “the service is a professional service, enabling easy online access to our data via a sophisticated set of tools and functionality. In a typical week, LDS gets upwards of 500 file downloads of our datasets—which is much, much more than when our data distribution was manually administered.”</p>
<p>Not only has opening the datasets increased usage in numbers, it’s also invited a more diverse user-base, says Vicki. “Because it’s much more accessible now, and free to access, we are seeing our customer base grow to include smaller organisations that may not have used LINZ data before , whereas customers who used our previous services were generally professional organisations who could consume that complex data quite easily.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“It was generally very complex, so it was quite a shift in philosophy for us to go from being a raw bulk data distributor to taking that data and making it accessible to that a wider range of users” adds Jeremy.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Landscape architect Nigel Cowburn, of Growplan Ltd., uses the LDS’ datasets in order to arrive at worksites to meet clients “fully armed” with information about the property and landscape as it currently exists. He says the LDS enables him to prepare ahead of time. “It’s free and reliable, and helps me ask intelligent questions,” Nigel says. “It makes the remote part of my work possible, as I have a good idea of the landscape before I go—the more information I can access online, the better.”</p>

<p>LDS is frequently updated to meet the needs of its customers. But as with any large operation, the project didn’t come without its obstacles. “The release and simplification of large datasets were a big challenge for us to manage—from the outset, however, by partnering with Koordinates, they had already solved some of the issues..”</p>
<p>Jeremy notes that the service is really showing results. The number of registered users of the LINZ Data Service, currently standing at almost 6.500, continues to climb by an impressive 300 users every month. These customers, spanning government, geospatial, survey, utility, contracting, and engineering sectors and beyond, are using the LINZ Data Service to realise efficiencies, innovation and improved decision-making.</p>
<p>The LDS’ efforts haven’t gone unrecognised. LINZ was the recipient of the <em>JK Barrie Award for Overall Excellence</em> at the <a href="http://www.spatialbusiness.org/aus/Upcoming-Events/Asia-Pacific-Spatial-Excellence-Awards">Asia Pacific Spatial Excellence Awards</a>—the premier forum for recognising the spatial information industry’s top performers. Of the award, <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/news-publications-and-consultations/news-and-notices/lds-named-asia-pacific%E2%80%99s-best-of-the-best">LINZ Chief Executive Peter Mersi</a> says “it is recognition of the highest order of the value of developing and implementing an easy-to-use geospatial data sharing service.” Mersi says LDS has played a part in “revolutionising the way people can discover, use and share New Zealand public data.”</p>
<p>Jeremy notes that Australians are “envious of the openness of the whole ecosystem” that LDS uses. “In Australia, the multiple levels of government have imposed a model where they’re trying to still do cost recovery for their assets. The fact that we were able to remove barriers with Creative Commons licences really made an impact and helped us win that award. Over there, a lot of their data is still very locked up.”</p>
<p>Quizzed about their advice to other government agencies considering using open licencing, both Jeremy and Vicki are supportive of the measures. “I’d definitely recommend opening access to public, non -private information across government. If there’s a mandate to adopt open licensing, and you want to get it done, NZGOAL and Creative Commons licences get really good results and can reduce timeframes to actually just get the data out there.”</p>

<h5>By Josh Wright</h5>
<p>On his blog <a href="http://davegiles.blogspot.co.nz/2012/05/disappearing-historical-data.html"><em>Econometrics Beat</em></a>,Canadian economist David E Giles describes the open presentation of <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/">Statistics New Zealand</a>’s (SNZ) data online: “<em>This isn’t just a collection of boring spreadsheets. It’s a valuable and serious piece of data research</em>.”</p>
<p>He’s right—SNZ have been pioneers in maximising transparency through the open licensing of many of their datasets, which they release online through web-based applications <em>NZ.Stat</em> and <em>Infoshare.</em> While SNZ is best known to the public for their management of the census, their remit stretches beyond just this—and they use open licences on much of their data to ensure it has maximum reach.</p>
<p>The logic for SNZ is simple. Releasing data in an open framework helps for a range of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it makes it easier for government agencies to work together;</li>

    <li>it reduces the cost of providing an existing government service, with decreased paperwork and hoops to jump through;</li>

    <li>it maximises access and visibility to users, attracting new customers;</li>

    <li>and it reduces the cost of accessing and processing information for existing users.</li>

</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programmes/open-and-transparent-government/open-data-case-studies/">Open Government Information and Data Re-use Work Programme</a> has written up some case studies about how SNZ has released data in an open format. Given these case studies are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licences themselves, we thought it would be good to summarise them for a wider public audience.</p>
<p><strong>Census data</strong></p>
<p>Census data is what most of the public know SNZ for. Through their website, SNZ has released blocks of census data from 1996, 2001, and 2006 under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licences. These datasets—which include information on age, ethnicity, income, workplace, dwelling size and geography—can be organised online and then downloaded in a variety of formats for remix and re-use.</p>
<p>A dedicated team works to develop Census datasets for phased release. The team is constantly looking for ways to improve: for each new census recorded, changes and improvements in the range of datasets available are made based on user feedback. While the 2011 Census was delayed because of the Christchurch earthquake, data from this year’s Census will be available from December onwards.</p>
<p><strong>Economic indicators data</strong></p>
<p>SNZ also release economic datasets, which detail New Zealand’s gross domestic product, consumer price index, balance of payments, and productivity—all on a quarterly basis. This data is freely available for public and business through web-based tools that aid in the preparation and formatting of datasets for open use.</p>
<p>Opening economic indicator data has been a great step for SNZ’s visibility and usefulness to New Zealand. Businesses, government agencies, community organisations, and research institutions use the data to direct their research and development and to inform their decision-making at all levels—making New Zealand a savvier, better-informed, and ultimately more prosperous place to live.</p>
<p><strong>‘Tier 1’ statistics</strong></p>
<p>These statistics, released online through SNZ’s web-based applications, describe New Zealand’s economy, environment, population, society, culture, international relations, and civil and political rights. Government, businesses, and members of the public use these statistics to make informed decisions and monitor the state and progress of New Zealand.</p>
<p>So—what makes them ‘Tier 1’? They are consistent, of high quality, and have integrity. This is why they are the priority for the government’s statistical production. Tier 1 statistics are optimal for public, wide use, which is why it’s important that they are published in a way that allows for equal and open access. Like the other data services, Tier 1 statistics are delivered through a broad range of formats, including in reports, as aggregate data, and (with some restrictions) as microdata.</p>
<p><strong>How is it all released?</strong></p>
<p>In order to actually get data from their systems into customers’ hands, SNZ use their online data tools <em>Infoshare </em>and <em>NZ.Stat</em>, which were implemented through the Making Information Freely Available programme in 2008-09. <em>Infoshare</em>, designed in consultation with users to facilitate open databases, was the successor to <em>INFOS</em>, a closed subscription system that had only 90 consistent subscribers.</p>
<p>SNZ’s decision to open up their data through web-based data retrieval applications has seen user numbers increase from 90 to over 100,000 in 2011-12. Not only are these web-based applications user-friendly, they allow customers to organise their data to suit them—presenting information in different formats to meet the needs of a diversity of users.</p>
<p>We think this is a pretty neat use of open licensing—kudos to SNZ for showing the initiative!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programmes/open-and-transparent-government/open-data-case-studies/">Open Government Information and Data Re-use Work Programme</a> has written up some case studies about how SNZ has released data in an open format. Given these case studies are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licences themselves, we thought it would be good to summarise them for a wider public audience.</p>
<p><strong>Census data</strong></p>
<p>Census data is what most of the public know SNZ for. Through their website, SNZ has released blocks of census data from 1996, 2001, and 2006 under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licences. These datasets—which include information on age, ethnicity, income, workplace, dwelling size and geography—can be organised online and then downloaded in a variety of formats for remix and re-use.</p>

Licensed under CC BY-SA.</p>
<p>A dedicated team works to develop Census datasets for phased release. The team is constantly looking for ways to improve: for each new census recorded, changes and improvements in the range of datasets available are made based on user feedback. While the 2011 Census was delayed because of the Christchurch earthquake, data from this year’s Census will be available from December onwards.</p>
<p><strong>Economic indicators data</strong></p>
<p>SNZ also release economic datasets, which detail New Zealand’s gross domestic product, consumer price index, balance of payments, and productivity—all on a quarterly basis. This data is freely available for public and business through web-based tools that aid in the preparation and formatting of datasets for open use.</p>
<p>Opening economic indicator data has been a great step for SNZ’s  visibility and usefulness to New Zealand. Businesses, government agencies, community organisations, and research institutions use the data to direct their research and development and to inform their decision-making at all levels—making New Zealand a savvier, better-informed, and ultimately more prosperous place to live.</p>
<p><strong>‘Tier 1’ statistics</strong></p>
<p>These statistics, released online through SNZ’s web-based applications, describe New Zealand’s economy, environment, population, society, culture, international relations, and civil and political rights. Government, businesses, and members of the public use these statistics to make informed decisions and monitor the state and progress of New Zealand.</p>
<p>So—what makes them ‘Tier 1’? They are consistent, of high quality, and have integrity. This is why they are the priority for the government’s statistical production. Tier 1 statistics are optimal for public, wide use, which is why it’s important that they are published in a way that allows for equal and open access. Like the other data services, Tier 1 statistics are delivered through a broad range of formats, including in reports, as aggregate data, and (with some restrictions) as microdata.</p>
<p><strong>How is it all released?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In order to actually get data from their systems into customers’ hands, SNZ use their online data tools <em>Infoshare </em>and <em>NZ.Stat</em>, which were implemented through the Making Information Freely Available programme in 2008-09. <em>Infoshare</em>, designed in consultation with users to facilitate open databases, was the successor to <em>INFOS</em>, a closed subscription system that had only 90 consistent subscribers.</p>
<p>SNZ’s decision to open up their data through web-based data retrieval applications has seen user numbers increase from 90 to over 100,000 in 2011-12. Not only are these web-based applications user-friendly, they allow customers to organise their data to suit them—presenting information in different formats to meet the needs of a diversity of users.</p>
<p>We think this is a pretty neat use of open licensing—kudos to SNZ for showing the initiative!</p>

<h5>By Josh Wright</h5>
<p>Since the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework was approved by Cabinet in 2010, NZ government agencies have released nearly 2000 datasets to <a href="https://data.govt.nz/" target="_blank">data.govt.nz</a> under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of reasons for this to happen. First, open data is more efficient, as it makes it easier (and cheaper) for thousands of New Zealand data users -- both inside and outside of government -- to do their job. Second, open data make it easier to find out just what New Zealand government agencies actually do; that is to say, open data makes government more transparent.</p>
<p>These are, we think, sufficient reasons to justify the open release of public data. But open data also enables the development of new tools and services,  tools and services that wouldn't have otherwise been produced. Over the last few years, the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programmes/open-and-transparent-government/open-government-information-and-data-work-programm/">Open Government Information and Data Re-use Work Programme</a> has written about some of these innovative cases of open data reuse. As these case studies are made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution licence</a>, we've decided to summarise them for a non-government audience. Enjoy!</p>
<h4><strong>ANZ Truckometer</strong></h4>

<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/0003-Coal-trucks-Greymouth-maybe.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4241" title="0003 Coal trucks - Greymouth (maybe)" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/0003-Coal-trucks-Greymouth-maybe.jpg" alt="" width="308" height="238"></a> "Coal Trucks, Greymouth (maybe)" by <a href="http://www.vcbrowne.com/Detailprom.aspx?RID=PB0903&amp;PID=3" target="_blank">VC Browne &amp; Son</a>, via DigitalNZ. No known copyright.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://anz.co.nz/commercial-institutional/economic-markets-research/truckometer/">ANZ Truckometer</a> uses <a href="http://www.nzta.govt.nz/">New Zealand Transport Agency</a> traffic volume data to predict economic growth or decline. Focusing on key traffic routes, ANZ’s research has found that analysing traffic flows gives a forecast on New Zealand’s economic direction—and is accurate six months into the future.</p>
<p>The Truckometer benefits both ANZ and its customers: customers gain accurate insights into economic forecasts, which in turn bolsters confidence in ANZ. Moreover, ANZ’s data analysis has helped identify and fix errors in the original traffic volume dataset—proof of the benefits to government departments in placing their datasets under open licences.</p>
<h4><strong>Ministry of Education</strong></h4>

<p>Government ministries themselves have been creating avenues for the release and dissemination of openly licenced government data. Seeking to make school information more available, the <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/">Ministry of Education</a>’s (MoE) <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/nz-schools/id507340099?mt=8">NZSchools</a> app re-uses data from the MoE, the Historic Places Trust (HPT), and the Education Review Office (ERO) mashed into a user-friendly, navigable Google Maps framework.</p>
<p>NZSchools provides parents, students and educators with basic school information, including decile and total roll; displays school enrolment zones and bus routes; and links ERO reports to schools, amongst other features. However, app use has grown wider than just this: it is also used by real estate companies to display school zoning, and by news media to show data and graphics from the app. The MoE, ERO and HPT all benefit from a wider dissemination and greater visibility of their already-open datasets.</p>
<h4><strong>Land Information New Zealand</strong></h4>

<p>While the NZSchools app was made in-house, other government agencies have licenced their data openly with the intention that third parties utilise it. <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/">Land Information New Zealand</a> (LINZ) releases its <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/tidal-info/tide-tables/">tide prediction data</a>, which is used by a range of mobile and desktop app developers. These  apps, which include QuickTide, NZ Tides, and TidePlan, broadcast up-to-date data in an accessible, clear format ,</p>
<p>Tides data is also used by <a href="http://www.metservice.com/national/home">MetService</a> on their public weather website and on their page in daily newspapers. The broadcasting of up-to-date, accurate data allows people who use the sea—whether commercially or recreationally—to make good risk management decisions, keeping people healthy and safe.</p>
<h4><strong>Pocket Ranger</strong></h4>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-ranger/id475605299?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Pocket Ranger</a> is a smartphone app primarily concerned with user safety. Developed by the <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/">Department of Conservation</a> in partnership with <a href="http://www.tongariro.org.nz/">Project Tongariro</a>, Pocket Ranger relies on open data made available by  DOC to give users descriptions of the tracks, points of interest, photographs, maps and safety information in and around the national park.</p>
<p>The app uses QR codes placed on stands to provide location-based information to walkers in the park. These sit in lieu of traditional signs, which have a more significant impact on the natural environment. The next release of the app will have GPS integration, aimed at creating even greater accessibility, and further enhancing user safety.</p>
