<p>Did you attend New Zealand's <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/talks/events/webstock-11/" target="_self">Webstock 2011 Conference</a> or catch an <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/talks/speakers/amanda-palmer/amanda-palmer-and-jason-webley-play-webstock/" target="_self">Amanda Palmer gig</a> in February?

<h3>36 monthly albums &amp; more new music under Creative Commons</h3>

<p>In the world of music, Creative Commons licenses continue to be used by upcoming and established musicians for everything from remix contests to album-a-month projects. And since CC-licensed music <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/creativecommons/status/65042101762662400" target="_self">may be blaring from outerspace</a> for the first time in history on NASA’s Endeavour mission, we thought it would be a good time to do a round-up of the recent developments in Creative Commons music land.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Music Monthly</strong></p>
<p>Two years ago, L.A.-based musician John Wood and CC-friendly record label vosotros <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13077" target="_self">launched</a> Learning Music Monthly, an album-a-month musical series. Every month, John Wood wrote, recorded, mixed, and mastered an album—and made each album available as part of a tiered subscription service that ranged from a donation-based digital option (available for download under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY-NC-SA license</a>) to a $60 package that included handmade albums delivered to your mailbox, limited edition stickers, bonus albums from friends of LMM, and even personalized birthday songs! These extras inevitably evolved as the project scaled, but the albums kept coming, an impressive feat for John Wood and his friends.</p>
<p>After three seasons and 36 albums, LMM has finally come to an end. In celebration, <a href="http://www.vosotros.com/" target="_self">vosotros</a> has created an excellent 37 song Learning Music compilation entitled, “<em><a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Learning_Music/An_End_Like_This/" target="_self">An End Like This</a></em>,” <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/label/Vosotros/blog/An_End_Like_This" target="_self">blogged</a> over at the Free Music Archive. Additionally, all of the albums are <a href="http://learningmusicmonthly.com/archives/" target="_self">archived</a> for continuous discovery and remix at the LMM site.</p>
<p><strong>R.E.M.</strong></p>
<p>A great example of new, open distribution models, LMM is only one of many musicians and projects encouraging participation and remix under CC licenses. Earlier this year, R.E.M. launched a CC remix contest for “<a href="http://soundcloud.com/groups/iht-remix" target="_self">It Happened Today</a>” on SoundCloud, one of the web’s easiest platforms for sharing your CC-licensed originals and remixes. Stems from the song were released under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY-NC-SA</a>, and remixes were uploaded to SoundCloud under the same license. You can check out all remixed versions of the song <a href="http://soundcloud.com/groups/iht-remix" target="_self">here</a> and read more about what went down at CC Australia’s <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/weblog/entry/2575" target="_self">coverage</a> of the contest.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Simon</strong></p>
<p>Indaba, a hub for musical collaboration online, also continues to work with an expanding and interesting array of musicians for its artists remix contests. A recent contest featured Paul Simon’s latest single “<a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/opportunities/paul-simon" target="_self">Love Is Eternal Sacred Light</a>,” soliciting fan remixes under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY-NC-ND</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nighty Night by 8in8</strong></p>
<p>And the latest treat is <a href="http://music.amandapalmer.net/album/nighty-night" target="_self">Nighty Night by 8in8</a>, an all-star collaboration between Ben Folds, Amanda Palmer, Neil Gaiman, and Damien Kulash from OK Go. The group set out to make eight songs in eight hours, and released the resulting album under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY-NC</a>. You can read Neil’s account of the song-making process at his <a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2011/04/supergroup-madness.html" target="_self">blog</a> and buy the album at Amanda Palmer’s <a href="http://music.amandapalmer.net/album/nighty-night" target="_self">bandcamp page</a>. Initial proceeds will go to <a href="http://berkleecitymusicnetwork.org/" target="_self">berkleecitymusicnetwork.org</a>, a charity dedicated to fulfilling kids’ musical potential.</p>

<p>These high quality aerial images of Christchurch following the devastating February 6.3 magnitude earthquake have <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake/4809621/High-quality-aerial-pictures-of-Christchurch-available" target="_self">been made available</a> on the <a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/3185-christchurch-post-earthquake-aerial-photos-24-feb-2011/" target="_self">Koordinates</a> platform under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>.</p>
<p>The images were produced by <a href="http://www.nzam.com/default.asp" target="_self">New Zealand Aerial Mapping (NZAM)</a> for <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/index.aspx" target="_self">Land Information New Zealand</a>. Their birds-eye-view perspective of the area helped Christchurch Police, Civil Defence, and other emergency services asses damage.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">licence</a> attached to their public release allows anyone to legally copy, share, and adapt the imagery as long as they attribute the source.</p>
<p>The move to make public sector materials available under an open access option such as the Creative Commons Attribution licence is in line with the <a href="http://www.e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal" target="_self">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing (NZGOAL) Framework</a>. This framework provides guidance for agencies when releasing copyright works and non-copyright material for re-use by third parties (the public), and was approved by Cabinet last July.</p>
<p>Those assisting the government to encourage Creative Commons licensing under the NZGOAL framework have noted its utility during the post-quake period where access to information and imagery is hugely important, and agencies are looking for guidance on releasing these materials.</p>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/" target="_self">Civil Defence</a> released some <a href="http://nbr.co.nz/article/video-central-christchurch-two-weeks-after-quake-ck-88665" target="_self">inner city footage</a> for screening at memorial events under a Creative Commons Attribution licence also.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbXJJN9ZSFc]</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/" target="_self">NZ Defence Force</a> are following suit by making their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nzdefenceforce/" target="_self">collections of recent photos</a>, many of Christchurch, Creative Commons Attribution via a Flickr stream.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nzdefenceforce/5469221429/in/set-72157625987305601/"><img class="size-full wp-image-475" title="chchcath" src="http://cc.royalsociety.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/chchcath.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331"></a></p>
<p>The non government project '<a href="http://eq.org.nz/" target="_self">Christchurch Recovery Map</a>' has also taken up the Creative Commons movement surrounding the February events. Its open and crowd-sourced map application of damage and relief reports throughout the city provided an API function and map images available under the Attribution licence.</p>

<p>The world's first wikimusical project <em>Xerxes’ Atlas</em> based in Auckland will use Creative Commons licences to achieve a highly collaborative musical feat. The production team have now announced they’re ready for contributors from theatre lovers around the globe.</p>
<p>The story is based on biblical/Jewish tale and follows Esther in the ancient Persia. After finding herself caught up in a beauty pageant where the winner becomes Queen of King Xerxes' massive empire, she wins the heart of the king only to discover a plot to declare a law of genocide against her own people.</p>
<p>The age-old story is set to be revived in a truly twenty first century breed of theatre production. "Xerxes' Atlas is about community and collaboration on a scale not seen in modern times in theatre,” said 28-year old creator and production board member Jade Wood.</p>
<p>Once composers have signed up online, they are able to start contributing to storyboard and song briefs by adding to other people's work-in-progress or craft their own <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike</a> licensed versions based on the briefs. Similar processes follow for the choreography and visual design elements whereby the internet community is invited to submit ideas and work with each other. A process of selection and polishing then takes place under the supervision of the show's Board of Directors. The script is co-developed by two writers and once the product is complete, people are able to remix and change it for themselves.</p>
<p>The premiere will be live-streamed from Auckland and made available online under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommecial-Share Alike 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>. The wikimuscial format means that a production could sound vastly different on Broadway than it is in the West End or even the West End a month after you saw it, since derivative versions are encouraged.</p>
<p>Chairwomen of the <em>Xerxes’ Atlas</em> Board, Bridget Marsh, said “declining theatre numbers, especially among younger generations, is a very real threat to the industry. We’re reaching out to a younger audience by developing a musical that connects with them through the internet and social media.”</p>
<p>“People can visit the website right now to read the song briefs and hear others’ contributions,” says Wood, “bringing a whole new audience around the world.”</p>

<p>Tonight's the night to get your remix or mashup entries in to <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_self">Mix and Mash: the great NZ remix and mashup competition</a>. If you've reused some appropriately licensed Creative Commons material in your entry it's worth taking some time at this point to make sure you credit your sources properly.</p>
<p>Each of the six main Creative Commons copyright licences have an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/characteristic/by" target="_self">Attribution</a> requirement built into them - meaning that you must attribute or 'credit' that work in the way the copyright holder wishes each time you reuse their work.</p>
<p>If the CC licensor has given you specific instructions on how to attribute them, then be sure to follow these instructions when you cite them in your <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/enter.html" target="_self">entry form</a>.</p>
<p>Many CC licensors don't give you specific instructions on how to attribute them though. On your entry form, follow these rules for <strong>EACH</strong> piece of CC content you've used (based on the Creative Commons <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FFAQ#How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work.3F" target="_self">FAQ</a>):</p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Cite the author's name, screen name, user identification, etc. You could even link to the person's profile page, if such a page exists.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Cite the work's title or name, if such a thing exists. The judges will want to see a direct link to the original work if such a link exists.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Cite the specific CC licence the work is under. It's preferable that you provide a link to the licence.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Your entry is obviously going to be a 'derivative work' (remix) of the original works you are citing. You may want to describe which parts of the original content you've changed and how.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre>

<p>If you've new to the Creative Commons licences and have found some CC material you'd like to use for the competition, take a look at our <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences_explained__1" target="_self">licences explained page</a> or <a href="mailto:admin@creativecommons.org.nz" target="_self">get in contact</a> for some friendly tips on how it all works (not legal advice).</p>
<p>This competition is very important for rewarding those who can re-use content and datasets in ways that are creative, that solve real world problems or display a truly innovative spark. We encourage the New Zealand Creative Commons community to get involved, since showcasing what can be done with open access materials encourages our State Agencies and cultural institutions to apply open access wherever they can. The more we creatively draw upon our Kiwi commons, the more reason we have for unlocking knowledge for the benefit of all.</p>

<p>For Open Access Week we spoke with Sam Giffney creator of <a href="http://www.zenbu.co.nz/" target="_self">Zenbu</a>, a New Zealand based directory set of geotagged businesses. Sam is an avid follower of free culture, and if you followed the last featured <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/creative_commoners/koordinates_the_one_place_for_geodata" target="_self">profile of Koordinates</a> it's handy to know that Zenbu data is freely available under its <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution licence</a> on the <a href="http://koordinates.com/layers/global/oceania/new-zealand/#/maps/zenbu/" target="_self">Koordinates platform</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How did you hear about Creative Commons, and what was it that got you interested?</strong></p>
<p>I am a long time fan of the Science Fiction books of Cory Doctorow which are CC licensed. I think Cory introduced me to the book Free Culture by Lawrence Lessig which lays out the fascinating history of copyright and excellent arguments for Creative Commons. I highly recommend Lessig's book to anyone with an interest in how copyright got to the state it is in today.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose an Attribution licence for Zenbu?</strong></p>
<p>We use the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution licence</a> Why? A number of reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Any project that crowdsources needs to supply something in return, Zenbu relies on the input of the masses and it seems only fair that we make that data freely available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The biggest problem Zenbu would face for a long time is obscurity. A CC Licence is a way to give forwards in an attempt to build up the critical mass needed to succeed. Data security, with respect to copyright, would just be a distraction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zenbu is a collection of facts from the real world, the same basic information that you can see on shop signs as you walk down the street: names, addresses, phone numbers, opening hours. Everyone agrees that facts can not be subject to copyright but, according to an early conversation I had with a Yellow Pages IP lawyer, "version of fact" can be copyright. Interestingly an Australian Federal court recently ruled that Sensis has no copyright in the White or Yellow Pages. This issue is a field day for lawyers and a minefield for everyone else. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_self">The Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence</a> has no restrictions on sharing or commercial use; it is the most open license available with the one small caveat that Zenbu should be attributed. It is the least imposing way we can try to create a virtuous circle that means more and more people will feed information into Zenbu and make it an authoritative source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use the non-localised version because one day I would like Zenbu to be global.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How does the act of content sharing fit into the work you do, or the product you offer to others?</strong></p>
<p>Zenbu is a collaboratively edited directory of businesses and places. Content sharing is the heart of all activity on Zenbu.</p>
<p><strong>Have you had any unexpected new uses of the content you work with since licensing under CC?</strong></p>
<p>Zenbu data keeps popping up all over the place. I've heard of a secondary school teacher using it their geography classes. I've heard of government agencies using it in research. There's also <a href="http://wiki.zenbu.co.nz/index.php/Third_Parties_Using_Zenbu_Data" target="_self">a whole bunch of projects</a> who openly use the data to enhance their products.</p>
<p>I think one of the coolest examples was a tech student who approached me about creating an iPhone app using Zenbu data for his final project. Zenbu already had an iPhone app but this student really nailed the user interface and his app <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/find-nz/id311117200?mt=8" target="_self">Find! NZ</a> was number one in the App Store navigation category continually for a year after the launch.</p>
<p><strong>Future plans for your project?</strong></p>
<p>As of October 2010 we have 95,000 entries in Zenbu New Zealand, which is probably about 40 per cent of New Zealand business, although we do have excellent coverage in the most searched categories like restaurants and accommodation. I'm looking forward to the day when Zenbu has it all, like the logo says "Zenbu. Find Everything".</p>

<p><a href="http://koordinates.com/" target="_self">Koordinates</a> is a New Zealand based company that provides clever platforms for hosting and viewing geographic datasets. Map layers are visualised online and can be downloaded as professional data in a way that has been described as 'Google Earth for professionals'. Koordinates often relies on, and indeed encourages providers of its geographic datasets to be published under a Creative Commons licence to streamline reuse.</p>
<p>Koordinates currently provides datasets about things from <a href="http://koordinates.com/#/layer/1600-feral-goat-distribution-in-northland-1-july-2007/" target="_self">feral goat distribution</a> to <a href="http://koordinates.com/#/layer/1443-wellington-city-wind-zones/" target="_self">Wellington windy zones</a>, all sourced from outside parties like Government departments and independent business listing services.</p>
<p>The Koordinates website offers the information to us as <a href="http://koordinates.com/#/layers/global/oceania/new-zealand/" target="_self">'layers'</a> which we can visually layer together over a map as we choose. "When you add a map layer, the actual data is converted into a simple Google Maps view and displayed in your web browser" says Ed Corkery, co-founder and CEO of Koordinates.</p>
<p>A piece of information that can be associated with a geographic location comes alive when we work with maps. Property buyers, for example can pull together layers displaying high resolution aerial photos, building footprints, street locations, kerbs, school zone boundaries, parks and electoral ward boundaries to learn more about the context of their future house.</p>
<p>The sorts of useful datasets we would like to see layered on a map are often collated and updated by Government agencies and are subject to crown copyright. Although some datasets are of a commercial nature and retain an 'all rights reserved' status, most are provided for public reuse via Koordinates under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>. New Zealand councils and Government agencies are embracing Creative Commons for their datasets on Koordinates as encouraged by the <a href="http://www.e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal" target="_self">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework</a> and its strong endorsement of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_self">CC BY</a> licence for non-personal copyright materials.</p>
<p>But it's not just policy that is driving early uptake of CC licences in this area. Koordinates has actively encouraged its providers to consider open access as part of their publishing practices.</p>
<p>According to Ed a "lack of clearly understood licences is a big road block to reuse of public data. We recommend the Creative Commons licensing system as an easy way for councils and Government agencies to avoid that road-block by using an off-the-shelf licence system reaching critical mass."</p>
<p>If we're given enough layers and enough access, the uses for this platform are endless.</p>
<p>It's not just hobbyists or researchers who can benefit from this knowledge, but industry and professional practitioners gain value from readily available geographic datasets too. Upfront information about a location's soil content, for example, can streamline planning and decision making processes for farmers, builders and civil engineers.</p>
<p>While Koordinates can host and make such information available as layers, it is providing commercial opportunities for third party application developers to package up certain information in user friendly ways for many different types of people.</p>
<p>"A developer can combine datasets from Koordinates and turn them into a more useful service such as iPhone apps." Says Ed.</p>
<p>It's foreseeable that a Government agency's initial decision to release geographic data under permissible licences is not only benefiting nonprofit activities but is also stimulating healthy new business opportunities within our community.</p>
<p>The datasets themselves need to be be freed up from technical and copyright restrictions so that people can fully utilise the resources with fewer administrative burdens slowing it all down. Off-the-shelf copyright licences, such as Creative Commons, solve this problem.</p>

<p>Our favourite Kiwi synth master Luke Rowell of Disasteradio has released a new full length album today under a "pay what you like" system complete with its own Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>Charisma is an eleven track work <a href="http://disasteradio.bandcamp.com/" target="_self">available for download here</a> on bandcamp. Even though you're able to obtain the album for free, the option to give some money for this 'cyberspace post-apocalyptic symphonic love epic' is made really easy on the online checkout system. Or, you can show support by ordering a <a href="http://alowhum.com/disasteradio-charisma/" target="_self">sweet Disasteradio fridge magnet</a> through the A Low Hum label. It appears to be the largest fridge magnet in history.</p>
<p>Disasteradio had previously released five albums for download under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike licence</a> which you can read more about <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/creative_commoners/luke_rowell_disasteradio" target="_self">on our website here</a>. Interestingly Luke has decided to return to CC licensing for his tracks after releasing a freely downloadable 'all rights reserved' album called <a href="http://disasteradio.bandcamp.com/album/visions-video-single" target="_self">Visions</a>. This time he's going with something in-between, an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_self">Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works licence</a> to satisfy his wish to monitor adaptations after a mammoth effort was invested in Charisma's production.</p>
<p>It's easy enough to get in touch with Disasteradio to request remixing permissions, which appears to be the object here of using a CC licence restricting derivatives - to ensure direct dialogue between the artist and those who might want to repurpose the work.</p>
<p>Disasteradio has used a fascinating range of licences over the last few years - lets see if the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY-NC-ND</a> and 'pay what you like' approach strikes a warm balance for Charisma in the coming months.</p>
<p>Well done Luke!</p>
