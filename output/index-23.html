<h5><strong>BY RICHARD WHITE</strong></h5>
<h5>1. "A Fair Minded and Honest Person."</h5>

<p>Ever wondered if that photo you got from Google images for a slideshow was a breach of copyright? Or the video you downloaded off the One News web site and emailed to your parents? There’s a good chance it was, unless you can argue that your use was fair dealing. While the US concept of fair use is probably the more widely known term, in NZ we have a similar thing known as fair dealing.</p>
<p>You’ve no doubt been greedily consuming the tasty morsels offered up on NZ Commons already and, in doing so, you may well have seen fair dealing in action in Thomas Huthwaite’s <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/artistic-work-original/">'When is an artistic work not original?'</a> He explicitly says -- and trust a lawyer to do this -- that his copying of several images is allowed under the NZ Copyright Act as fair dealing for the purposes of criticism and review. He’s bang on: without it he’d be breaching copyright in a piece about copyright breaches.</p>
<p>Essentially, fair dealing exists to balance your rights as a consumer of cultural works against the limited monopoly granted by law to the creators or publishers of those works. Copyright gives rights holders the exclusive right to copy, share, adapt or perform their work; fair dealing is one of the exceptions in the Act that allows you to use those works in certain ways. Whether you’re writing a high school essay, putting a book review on your blog or doing the literature review for your PhD, fair dealing is what allows you to copy parts of others’ works without gaining the permission of the rights holder.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/5818724469_d1b889196d_z.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-308" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/5818724469_d1b889196d_z.jpg" alt='Reference: "Judges - First Appellate Division - May 1923" by Law Society of Upper Canada. Copyright: No known copyright' width="640" height="507"></a> Reference: "Judges - First Appellate Division - May 1923" by <a href="https://flic.kr/p/9Sbu4F" target="_blank">Law Society of Upper Canada</a>. Copyright: No known copyright</p>
<p>In the digital age probably every one of us is copying someone else’s work every day without seeking permission, but there aren’t that many lawsuits around accusing people of breaching copyright. So who decides what is fair? Well, the Act provides some guidance (see below) but it’s case law that guides us in interpreting the Act.</p>
<p>The only problem is there is almost no case law involving fair dealing in NZ. In a <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2002/146.html">2002 case in Australia</a>, a judge made this remark: "Fair dealing involves questions of degree and impression; it is to be judged by the criterion of a fair minded and honest person, and is an abstract concept."</p>
<p>Similar comments have been made elsewhere. Now, you might be on the verge of spotting a difficulty here. In a world that has both John Banks and Winston Peters in it, working out what a fair minded and honest person thinks is probably going to take some time.</p>
<h5>2. The Fair Dealing Exceptions</h5>

<p>If your purpose is <b>research and private study</b> you can make a single copy from a work, as long as the copying is fair. Paraphrasing the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345962.html">fancy language of the Act</a>, what is fair depends on things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>the reason you were copying the work;</li>

    <li>the nature of the work itself;</li>

    <li>whether you could have bought it;</li>

    <li>whether the copying would affect the market for it; and</li>

    <li>the amount copied in relation to the whole (there’s no magic 10% or allowable number of pages).</li>

</ul>
<p>So, copying a chapter or section of a book would be far more fair than a bigger proportion, especially where you could just purchase your own copy. Copying would be more fair if you were using something no longer (or never) available commercially with a view producing a work of your own that placed the copied work in a much broader context. The key point here is that your copying must be for a purpose that informs <i>your own</i> research and <i>private </i>study; you can’t publish any copies you make under this provision, unless...</p>
<p>You can claim fair dealing with a work for the purposes of <b>criticism, review and news reporting</b>, provided there is sufficient acknowledgement, i.e. identifying the author/source and date of the work. Unlike research/private study, you can make multiple copies. The 'fairness' or otherwise of any copying for criticism or review would be determined according to similar factors as those listed under research or private study above.</p>
<p>Thomas Huthwaite’s piece is a good example: he uses low resolution copies of the works he is reviewing and provides a commentary on the legal implications of derivative works that borrow heavily from originals. Another good example is this post on the <a href="http://heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz/2013/10/the-school-journal.html">Auckland Libraries’ Heritage &amp; Research blog</a>: while it uses images from the covers of School Journals that are works by famous NZ artists, where the copyright will either be held by the artist or his or her estate or by the Ministry of Education (depending on whatever agreement was made at the time), the purpose is clearly to illustrate how a sense of nationhood is expressed through the works; the images are low resolution and so wouldn’t be suitable for commercial reproduction; and there is no commercial gain for the library or loss for the artist.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the fair dealing defence here only allows their copying for their purpose; it doesn’t allow anyone else to make further copies from their copies unless the next person can also claim fair dealing with the works. It’s still possible for a rights holder to challenge any use of his or her work of course as unfair. It’s all in the eye of the beholder -- and if the beholders can’t agree, then it’s down to the courts.</p>
<p>This provision also covers reporting of news and current events, though this specifically excludes photographs.</p>
<h5>3. The Limits of Fair Dealing</h5>

<p>What doesn’t fair dealing cover?  NZ law does not include a fair dealing exception for educational use because education has its own section in the Act. So you can’t argue that a particular use in the classroom is fair dealing, unless you’re critiquing/reviewing the work in some way of course; but to make, say, multiple copies of a chapter of a book you need to use one of the educational provisions that cover multiple copying, obtain a licence or get permission from the rights holder. Nor do we have a provision for parody and satire. You’d have to argue that you were critiquing the work if someone challenged your use as a breach of copyright.</p>
<p>From the above we can see that NZ copyright law spells out very specifically the purposes for which you could argue that your use of something is fair dealing with a copyright work. This is the same in the UK, Canada, Australia and many other countries. And this inflexibility is what has led many of these countries to debate whether adopting a more flexible US-style fair use framework would be better to encourage innovation and economic growth -- and just to allow what most of us would consider everyday acts in the digital age. But that’s a topic for another post...</p>
<p>To go back to the question in the title: who decides what is fair? In a very real sense it is you and me.  Our approach,  certainly in the educational sector, has been very conservative.  Consider the <a href="http://www.lianza.org.nz/resources/copyright/guidelines/copyright-guidelines-research-students">official advice</a> the Library &amp; Information Association of NZ gives to graduate research students: brief quotes are OK but be wary of any graph, table, diagram, excerpts from video, sound recordings, etc. “Students should always obtain prior permission from copyright owners where there is any doubt regarding the legality of including in-copyright materials in theses.”</p>
<p>It’s time to challenge this risk-averse approach. Our National Library is taking a lead, with its new <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/about-us/strategy-and-policy/collection-use-and-reuse-policy">collection and reuse policy</a>. And we can do this as individuals and institutions too. Take care and respect copyright but, as should be plain from the examples in this piece, you can take the role of the fair-minded and honest person and make your own judgement based on the purpose and nature of your use as to whether what you’re doing is fair.</p>

<h5>BY ANTON ANGELO</h5>
<p>When it's ‘Openly Accessible’, that’s when. The goal of Open Access is to make material legitimately freely available to the end user. Note the careful caveats: “freely”, implying no cost as well as easily findable; and “legitimately”, meaning legally unencumbered.</p>
<p>A lot of stuff out there on the net is Openly Accessible: you can find it, download it, read it or play it, but not much else. A good example of this is a lot of material on University Institutional Repositories. You may not think you know what they are, but you use them all the time if you do any research. When you search Google Scholar and there is a link to a PDF or txt document that isn’t to the original journal, that’s probably in some kind of repository. If the link is held at a university, it will probably be an institutional repository.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/07/8759939806_3413a663c2_z1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-301 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/07/8759939806_3413a663c2_z1.jpg" alt="8759939806_3413a663c2_z" width="424" height="268"></a> Reference: Cropped "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/archivesnz/8759939806" target="_blank">Lower Level Three Stacks"</a> by Archives New Zealand. Copyright: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY</a></p>
<p>Institutional Repositories (IRs) hold a lot of stuff, but the best stuff, the stuff no-one else has, are postgraduate theses. <a href="http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank">At Canterbury's IR </a>we have pretty much all the doctoral theses online, and we are working through Masters and other degree Research Reports.</p>
<p>There is gold in there. The oldest is a 1914 work on <a href="http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/3979" target="_blank">the outrageous land prices in Canterbury</a> (<em>plus ça change</em>). I know that some have been downloaded many thousands of times, and I have had emails of appreciation for making work available from as far away as a Nepalese ostrich farmer.</p>
<p>There are about 5,500 theses, and I put about a dozen up every week - both new theses and newly scanned older ones. As well as being a great research topic in themselves, the data in these works is invaluable. They contain geological maps, bibliographies, raw data sets -- every conceivable kind of information.</p>
<p>So, what can you do with them once you have read them? Almost nothing. You can quote bits of them, as long as you attribute the author. Can you print out one of the maps and put it on your wall? No. Can you re-use the data tables? Maybe, but you would best to ask the author of the thesis, if you can find them.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that all the theses have been uploaded with an “All Rights Reserved” licence, which, at the time the repository was founded, was not a bad choice. I’m working to get at least a choice of licences available for new theses, and I have a lot of support from my organisation to do so. But the people who really need to use the licences are the owners of the work -- the students writing their theses.</p>
<p>It's not as easy as it sounds - in a lot, if not a majority of cases, this is the first work a student has made publicly available. Previously, when students wrote an assignment, it went to an assessor, and that was it. Now, they are being asked to put their name to something that is going to be available all over the world, and they are quite justifiably shy.</p>
<p>We offer the option to hold back making the thesis public (an ‘embargo’) for a variety of legitimate reasons. Recently the rates of embargoes has shot up. (Is that coincidental with the issues of privacy being made more accessible through platforms like Facebook? Maybe. There is probably a thesis topic in that, just in itself).</p>
<p>Theses are Openly Accessible, but not, in our case, or the case of the majority of universities around the world, “Open Access”. We can access the work, but we can’t do anything with it, other than quote it. It may seem like splitting legal hairs, but it will become an important distinction if we decide to start mining this fantastic resource for information.</p>
<p>Often this work is the best stuff thesis writers will ever do, and it deserves respect. The best way we can respect it is to make it as available for reuse as possible, and get all the value we can out it.</p>

<h5>BY PAUL CALLISTER</h5>
<p>An editorial entitled ‘Improving outcomes for New Zealand men with prostate cancer’ features in the 14 February 2014 edition of the New Zealand Medical Journal. This will be a topic of interest to many men. But due to this journal’s publishing policies, the public cannot read the article until after six months.</p>
<p>In another area of research important to New Zealand, in 2013 an article ‘Evaluating Ecological Restoration Success: A Review of the Literature’ was published in the journal Restoration Ecology. But unless one is a member of the United States Society for Ecological Restoration, or has a library account that allows access to such journals, ‘citizen scientists’ cannot read it. New Zealand has large numbers of such ‘citizen scientists’ who freely give their time to run eco-restoration groups. It is vital for them to know whether their work is making a difference.</p>
<p>On many subjects, members of the public will want to get behind the headlines and the press releases to read the original, often taxpayer funded, research. But, unless one works for a university, a research institution or perhaps a government department, instant low cost access to such articles can be difficult.</p>
<p>Buying a particular article may not be a financial barrier for everyone. Sometimes the cost per article is relatively low. But until payment is made, it is difficult to determine whether the paper is useful. Most researchers have the experience of trolling many articles before finding useful ones.</p>
<p>Alternatively some paper copies of journals are held in New Zealand research libraries. But generally libraries are switching to electronic access and no longer hold printed versions. Or like the New Zealand Medical Journal, one may have to wait for a set period before an article becomes freely available.</p>
<p>So why do we have an emerging digital divide in society where one group has easy and instant access to new research often funded out of the public purse yet others face significant costs, delays or barriers to accessing knowledge?</p>
<p>Societies are increasingly complex. People are becoming better educated, with a dramatic rise in tertiary enrolments of young people and an increasing number of well educated people moving into retirement. Due to demographic changes the retired or semi-retired ageing population is also swelling in size. While there has been a recent emphasis on their participation in paid work, many older people also want to contribute to society in a voluntary capacity.</p>
<p>To participate in democratic processes, such as presenting submissions to select committees or local council planning hearings, it is increasingly necessary to undertake research on particular topics. For example, with predicted sea level rise, is it sensible to build or maintain sea walls? What does the international research say about ‘fracking’? Should water be fluoridated? To make the best possible decisions all parties should have access to the latest research.</p>
<p>In the past, one might have expected society’s ‘critics and consciences’ to be located in universities. Now many of these voices, including some who have retired, are outside these institutions.</p>
<p>One solution is for researchers to publish only in ‘open access’ journals that are freely available to everyone. Alternatively, all academic journals could move towards becoming open access. In some countries, strong incentives exist for research to be made widely available. In the United States, the health funder National Institutes of Health requires scientists to submit peer-reviewed journal manuscripts that result from their funding to the open access archive PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication. Currently, this is not a requirement of New Zealand’s equivalent agency, the Health Research Council.</p>
<p>There is on-going debate about the costs and benefits of shifting entirely to open access journals, but it seems unlikely this shift will occur in the short to medium term. So journal access generally requires a connection to a library with a subscription.</p>
<p>The National Library of New Zealand subscribes to many journal and article databases. But while some search results may be viewed from outside the National Library, most of their subscriptions require the researcher to examine the item's full text in one of the library’s reading rooms. This system clearly favours Wellington and Auckland based residents over those in other parts of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Free online access to The Cochrane Library is provided to all New Zealanders by the Ministry of Health. This is very useful in terms of access to a range of health research but does not include access to many health related journals.</p>
<p>More radical solutions are required. A number of years ago, Statistics New Zealand stopped charging for much data recognising that the wider economic value of making the data free was significantly more than the revenue obtained from selling it. A national site license option may be attractive to information suppliers---i.e. one cheque per annum and no administration hassles. Clearly there is a cost in providing access to journals. Even with open access journals someone has to pay for the editing, reviewing and production. But with all the innovations occurring in publishing and electronic information sharing ways to reduce substantially the cost of journal access could surely be found.</p>
<p>A large community of university and government researchers already enjoys ready access to on-line resources such as journals, presumably on terms that satisfy providers’ commercial needs. Arrangements to extend such access to those in the wider community should be considered.</p>

<h5>BY MIKE RIVERSDALE</h5>
<p>In our house, we have a shelf of cookbooks. Some have barely been opened, others are the classic “coffee table” types, but then there’s the ones we use at every opportunity. I’m sure you’re just the same.</p>
<p>I rely heavily on my British background and am never far from Mrs B (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Beeton's_Book_of_Household_Management"><i>Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management</i></a>) when I need to know how long to roast a chicken. Having been here in New Zealand since 1996, I will also reach for every student’s cooking bible, <a href="http://www.edmondscooking.co.nz/recipe.htm"><i>Edmonds Cookbook</i></a>.</p>
<p>Both these fine tomes pale into nothing when compared to my wife's recipe “book”. It is handmade, full of very old bits of paper and uses a hope and a prayer as a means of organisation.</p>

<p>This collection of recipes (to be called “Liz’s Recipe Book”, even though it’s not strictly a book) is chock full of IP -- that is, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a>, that nebulous stuff that seems to be both the oil and the grit in today's society.</p>
<p>So what has Liz’s Recipe Book got to do with Creative Commons?</p>
<p>Everything. Liz's Recipe Book is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/">CC-BY-NC</a> in action.</p>
<p>And that’s the main idea I’d like everyone to walk in to their kitchen with - Creative Commons is NOT a new, strange, librarian-focussed, computer-nerd ridden subject. It is most certainly a subject that librarians and IT folk <i>need</i> to have a deep understanding of, but it also swirls around us normal people.</p>
<p>So what is Creative Commons in the kitchen? It’s the right to have a copy of someone's recipe under strict instructions as how you can use it. This is an explicit right given by the originator of the recipe. It doesn’t imply ability -- just because you can follow the recipe, doesn't make you a good cook (I know). And if I use the recipe but still make a mess of it, that’s my problem, not the person who wrote the recipe.</p>
<p>Now, my mother-in-law passes on her recipes to everyone and anyone she can (and you’ll be happy if it’s you). She wants the world to know that her broccoli soup is da bomb and that everyone should make it. Just like Jamie Oliver, surely?</p>
<p>Almost. But imagine going into your local library, photocopying each page of <em>The Naked Chef</em> and walking out. Imagine trying to do that in Whitcoulls. Imagine doing that by filming Jamie Oliver in his restaurant.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? Jamie Oliver uses copyright to restrict use of his recipes to specified means - buy the book, watch the TV show, come to the live show, GO TO THE RESTAURANT.</p>
<p>Imagine if my mother-in-law said, “Here ya go Liz, have my broccoli soup recipe, that’ll be $5 please” - yeah, right! Or, even more unlikely, “Here ya go Liz, my favourite broccoli soup recipe. Oh, every time you show it to someone can you please get them to pay $10 and I’ll take my $5 cut?”</p>
<p>That’s not how family recipes are passed down, is it?</p>
<p>Imagine a world where everything was owned and managed like a Jamie Oliver recipe. We’d never get my wife’s Curry Broccoli Soup dish, and that would be a very sad world indeed. That’s not to say that I’m advocating getting rid of the standard, paid-for cookbook. Far from it. But I certainly don’t want to have a system of copyright applied as a default just because there’s no other option.</p>
<p>Luckily there is something else: Creative Commons. Using Creative Commons, my mother-in-law can protect herself and her recipes. She can ensure her broccoli soup recipe is passed on without hindrance. She can let future generations know that she’d love it to be used as the basis of future broccoli soup dishes. She can also, if she see’s fit, ensure that no-one can make money off her recipe.</p>
<p>Or maybe you have a recipe you want to protect in different ways? If so, check out <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank">the Creative Commons licences</a> that suit you and spread those delicious recipes* around the world for all to feast upon.</p>

<p>We are currently in the thick of a the political campaign for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_general_election,_2014" target="_blank">New Zealand general election, 2014</a> and at Wikipedia, our coverage continues apace, with articles for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:New%20Zealand%20electorates" target="_blank">every electorate</a>, every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Members_of_the_New_Zealand_House_of_Representatives%20" target="_blank">MP </a>and every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Political%20parties%20in%20New%20Zealand" target="_blank">political party</a>. What we are missing, by-and-large, is images to illustrate these articles.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/07/640px-BallotBoxes_NZ_2008.jpg"><img class="wp-image-291 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/07/640px-BallotBoxes_NZ_2008.jpg" alt='Reference: "Ballot Boxes" by Simon Lyall, via Wikimedia Commons.

<p>If you’re an aspiring photojournalist, or just happen to be in the right place at the right time, we’d love for you to take political photos and <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:UploadWizard" target="_blank">upload them</a> to Wikimedia commons.</p>
<p>What kinds of photos are we after? Pretty much any documentary photos: portraits of politicians (both as people and doing distinctively political things); hustings; polling stations; election-night parties; voter enrollment campaigns; election campaigns; etc. While even a poor quality image is better than no image of a subject, what we’re really after is well-composed, well-executed images of at least two megapixels. The better the quality of the image, the more options are available to users of the image going forward.</p>
<p>Describing and labelling your images is important—there are more than twenty million images on <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons</a> and without good descriptions and labels they’ll be unfindable. You should aim to describe who, what, when and where. Who are the people (if any) in the image? What are they doing? When are they do it? Where are they doing it? Descriptions of composition (‘landscape,’ ‘three-quarters length portrait,’ etc) can also be useful.</p>
<p>More generally we’re after photos to illustrate the people, places, events and abstract concepts which we have Wikipedia articles on. Fun projects: include stitched panoramas from local look-out spots; photos of public art installed locally; local marae, whakairo and tukutuku; portraits of local artists or officeholders; local historical sites (Māori pā, buildings listed by the Historic Places Trust, gravestones of notable people, etc); New Zealand native plants and animals; — the list is endless. New Zealand subject matter isn’t going to be documented by anyone else, so it’s largely up to us to do this work.</p>
<p>While it’s possible to upload images that other people have taken, due to the complications of getting copyright clearance, it’s better if the person who took the photos uploads the images. It’s typically easier to re-take photos than jump through the hoops of copyright clearance, unless you are dealing with thousands of photos or those of particular historical significance.</p>
<p>Both the English and Māori language Wikipedias have access to the same pool on images on Wikimedia commons, but the English language Wikipedia, as the larger of the two, uses many more images. Commons images can also also be used in Wikibooks, Wikiversity and other members of the WikiMedia family or reused in your own projects under appropriate licenses.</p>

<h5>BY THOMAS HUTHWAITE</h5>
<p>What do George Bush, Bob Dylan, and Shepard Fairey have in common? It sounds like the start to a bad joke, but potential copyright infringement is no laughing matter – particularly when trying to make a name for oneself as an original artist.</p>
<p>Here are three cautionary tales…</p>
<h5>“Hope”</h5>

<p>In 2008, street artist Shepard Fairey created an iconic image for Obama’s presidential election campaign. Fairey was already known for his use of repetition in street art (notably his “OBEY” poster featuring wrestler Andre the Giant), but this was taken to the next level with his blue and red image of Obama above the word “HOPE”.</p>
<p>The image went viral online and by October 2008, Fairey claimed to have printed the image on 300,000 physical posters, 1 million stickers, clothing and other items, not to mention the number of downloads of a free printable digital version. Fairey reportedly cited his inspiration as being a contemporary take on a well-known JFK portrait, or the image of President Lincoln on the five dollar note.</p>
<p>Barack Obama won the election, and Fairey became an internet sensation. But Fairey’s story became even more sensational in 2009 when he was accused of basing his image on an Associated Press photograph taken by Mannie Garcia in 2006. Associated Press sued for copyright infringement, while Fairey sought a declaration that his use of the photograph was protected by the doctrine of “fair use”.</p>
<p>In October 2009 and in the light of damning discovery documents, Fairey admitted that he had based his poster on the Associated Press photograph, and that he fabricated and destroyed evidence to hide that fact. With a finding of infringement likely, Fairey and Associated Press reached a confidential out of court settlement agreement in January 2011.</p>
<p>Fairey was later charged in a criminal suit with destruction of evidence and sentenced to 300 hours of community service and a US$25,000 fine.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Associated Press photograph and Fairey's poster</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>

<h5> “Drawn Blank”</h5>

<p>In late 2011, Bob Dylan exhibited the first of a series of paintings entitled “Drawn Blank”. The exhibition’s description was a “visual journal of travels in Japan, China, Vietnam, and Korea” with “first-hand depictions of people, street scenes, architecture and landscape”.</p>
<p>Within days, internet chatter revealed what appeared to be the true source of Dylan’s paintings. One painting, called “Opium”, was almost identical to a photo by Léon Busy (1915). Another, entitled “Trade”, is a replica of a photo by Henri Cartier-Bresson (1948). These are just two examples of several alleged copies:</p>
<p>Perhaps Dylan had ‘drawn a creative blank’ himself, and the exhibition title should have tipped us off. However, there have been no further repercussions for Dylan’s apparent copying, except perhaps a public loss of respect for his works.</p>

<h5>“Art of Leadership”</h5>

<p>It’s now mid-2014, and the gist of this article should signpost the irony of George Bush’s exhibition title. Instead of taking a lesson from the above case studies or leading by example, Bush also found himself the centre of controversy.</p>
<p>Bush gave detailed explanations of how he chose to paint each of the political figureheads shown in his exhibition. He explained having painted his father George H.W. Bush with a “gesture of compassion”, and Angela Merkel as being a “sympathetic portrait”.</p>
<p>But critics have now identified that many of Bush’s images are uncannily similar to the very first result of a Google images search. Here’s a visual example:</p>
<p>There seems to be little excuse for Bush, who once had access to all of the leaders in his exhibition, and certainly could have obtained an original photograph (or live sitting) of his own father. While being caught out must have caused some embarrassment, no further action has been taken against Bush.</p>

<h5>Take home messages</h5>

<ul>
<li>Do not copy existing copyright works or substantial parts of those works. Google search results and online images are not always “free” images in that they might well (and often do) attract copyright protection.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Create an original work, using inspiration where necessary. If you are drawing on some form of inspiration, carefully check and acknowledge your sources where required.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you want to use a copyright work outright, ask the owner for permission. Without the owner’s permission, direct copying of a work is likely to amount to copyright infringement.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you want to share your work, but think it’s difficult, talk to someone about using a Creative Commons license. They’re easy to understand, simple to apply, and provide clarity for all involved.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, be honest about your inspiration. If you are using someone else’s image – even if only as ‘inspiration’ – chances are that you will be found out!</li>

</ul>

<h5><strong>BY MATT MCGREGOR</strong></h5>
<p>Welcome to NZCommons, a site dedicated to opening New Zealand's culture and knowledge for sharing and reuse. Managed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</a>, NZCommons aims to be a busy community resource on the commons, with pieces ranging across government, data, education, copyright, heritage, research and the arts. We'll be adding additional categories as the site develops.</p>
<p>But why create a new site? While an increasing number of kiwis are sharing their work for reuse -- including schools, universities, musicians, museums and government departments -- we think it can be hard to find reliable commentary and advice on copyright and the commons.</p>
<p>We want NZCommons to be an information hub for the enormous number of New Zealanders, from librarians and teachers to artists and iwi groups, who are both excited and anxious about sharing their own work more openly and reusing content they find online.</p>
<p>At the moment, most of the content on NZCommons was written by or for Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ over the last four years -- but that will soon change. NZCommons is a community website, which means that its character will be largely determined by the people who volunteer to write for it. We've got dozens of people lined up to write for us over the next few months, from a variety of different fields.</p>
<p>At the same time, we're always on the lookout for more contributors. If you've got something to say about copyright, licensing and/or the commons in Aotearoa, then <a title="Contribute" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/contribute/">check out our contributors page</a> and get in touch.</p>
<p>You'll also note, between the articles, some particularly wonderful images. Most of these were sourced from <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/">Te Papa's great tranche</a> of out-of-copyright or CC licensed treasures, released a few weeks ago. We'll continue to plunder this and other great New Zealand open resources, including the <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">ever-growing resources at DigitalNZ</a>. If you see or make anything that needs showing off on our site, let us know.</p>
<p>We want the content on this website to travel, so unless we say otherwise, all the words on this website are licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>. You'll have to check the referencing for the images, which, like the wintery Wellington image below -- chosen because I'm writing from a particularly wintry Wellington morning -- is sourced from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Finally, we'd like to thanks our partners, <a href="https://internetnz.net.nz/" target="_blank">InternetNZ</a> and <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Land Information New Zealand</a>, who ensure that Creative Commons continues to flourish in Aotearoa New Zealand. We'd also like to thank <a href="http://prefer.co.nz/" target="_blank">Prefer</a>, for their in-kind support, and the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resource Foundation</a>, the new affiliate hosts of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>

<p>On behalf of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, I'm excited to announce that we're moving affiliate hosts to the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resource Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>This will mark the end of our four year affiliate relationship with the Royal Society of New Zealand.</p>
<p>CCANZ came to the Royal Society in 2010, after the Council for the Humanities – the original affiliate host – joined the Society.</p>
<p>Under the umbrella of the Royal Society, CCANZ has gone from strength to strength. We've seen a rapid increase in CC licence adoption across Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>Most of the CC community won't notice the difference. We'll still be based in Wellington, and we'll still be actively spreading the word about CC all around the country.</p>
<p>A big thanks to the Royal Society of New Zealand for hosting CCANZ for the last four years, and a equally big thanks to the OER Foundation for agreeing to be our new affiliate hosts.</p>
<p>Thanks also to Wayne Mackintosh of the OER Foundation and Fabiana Kubke, Chair of the CCANZ Panel, who have been working tirelessly to make this happen, as have the rest of the CCANZ Panel. A final thanks to Andrew Matangi from the Legal Team for providing ongoing advice.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we've got plenty of projects in the pipeline -- and plenty more ideas -- so watch out for more announcements in the weeks and months ahead. </p>
