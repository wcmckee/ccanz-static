<html><body><p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand wants tertiary students from all over New Zealand to share their thoughts on anything to do with copyright, open access and/or the commons.



Selected entries will be published on NZCommons.org.nz, and distributed to teachers, librarians, researchers, artists and other interested groups.



This is a great chance to help contribute to the public discussion on copyright in Aotearoa New Zealand.



You should feel free to write on any topic you wish. While the competition is run by Creative Commons, there is no requirement to write about open licensing.



The rules [link] can be found here.
