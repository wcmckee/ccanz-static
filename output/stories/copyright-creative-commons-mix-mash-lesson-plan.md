	<li>understand the range of Creative Commons licences;</li>

	<li>can choose and apply a creative commons licence for their own work;</li>

	<li>find content that can be reused and remixed;</li>

	<li>understand plagiarism.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Copyright</strong>



In general, copyright works cannot be copied, adapted, remixed, reused or shared without the copyright holder’s permission. In New Zealand, copyright lasts for the life of the author plus fifty years. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.copyright.org.nz/viewInfosheet.php?sheet=29">Copyright Council’s Introductory Factsheet</a>.



When material falls out of copyright, it enters the public domain. In New Zealand, all works produced by an author who died in 1962 or earlier are in the public domain.



<em>Remember, copyright also applies on the Internet.</em>



<strong>Creative Commons</strong>



<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</a> provides a series of licences which give users permission to share and adapt copyright works.



This video provides basic information about the licences: <a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782">Creative Commons Kiwi</a>



More resources explaining the Creative Commons licences can be found at <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.</a>



Creative Commons International provide a more philosophical take on remix and adaptation: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos/building-on-the-past">Building on the Past</a>.



<strong>How to Adapt, Remix and Attribute Your Sources</strong>



All Creative Commons licences require users to attribute their sources. If you fail to attribute properly, you violate the terms of the licences. While attribution can take several difference forms, in essence you should include:

<ul>

	<li>the name of the author or creator;</li>

	<li>the title of the work;</li>

	<li>a link to the work’s URL;</li>

	<li>a link to the Creative Commons licence the author or creator used;</li>

	<li>any additional information required in the licence statement.</li>

</ul>

You can put this information at the end of your work, or on the work’s webpage.



This <a href="http://schools.natlib.govt.nz/21st-century-literacy-inquiry/sources-resources/guide-reusing-digital-content">Free to Mix guide</a> outlines how to find and reuse digital content.



<a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/learn-more/fact-sheets/creative-commons-licence-basics">This fact sheet</a> from Creative Commons Australia goes into more detail about using attributing Creative Commons works.

<h3><strong>Discuss</strong></h3>

<ol>

	<li>‘Building on the Past’ argues that all creativity builds on the past. Is this true? Discuss some examples of famous artists—such as Shakespeare, Walt Disney and Peter Jackson—who famously adapted earlier works.  Is all creative work a remix of one kind or another?</li>

	<li>Discuss with students the differences between copyright, the Creative Commons licences and the public domain, using a scale from ‘most free’ to ‘most restrictive.'</li>

	<li>Discuss with students the difference between remix and plagiarism, leading into a discussion of the importance of attribution. Students should always credit the original creator when reusing work. Highlight the importance of note taking, summarising and referencing to keep track of all sources.</li>

</ol>

<h3><strong>Recall</strong></h3>

<a href="http://opencontent.org/game/betagame.html">This game</a> reinforces the different licences and makes students think about how you can mix and match different licence types.

<h3><strong>Think</strong></h3>

<ul>

	<li>What is the purpose of copyright?</li>

	<li>If we didn’t have copyright, would we still have creative work? Why or why not?</li>

	<li>What’s the difference between plagiarism and ‘inspiration’?</li>

	<li>What’s the difference between owning a song and owning a car?</li>

	<li>Give your own definition of plagiarism.</li>

</ul>

<h3><strong>Activity</strong></h3>

In this activity, students will create a new work that creatively re-uses and adapts source material provided by DigitalNZ, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand and the National Library of New Zealand. Students may submit their work to Mix &amp; Mash 2013: The New Storytelling for showcasing.

<h3><strong>Creative Commons for Teachers</strong></h3>

In most situations, the works produced by a teacher in a school (handouts, resources, lesson plans) are owned by their employer—which in New Zealand is the school’s Board of Trustees. Technically, this means that teachers who want to share their teaching and learning materials need to gain written permission from their employer before they can legally do this. Some schools make the process of sharing easier by adopting a Creative Commons Policy which makes all material produced by a teacher available under a CC-By licence. Examples of Creative Commons policies include:

<ul>

	<li><a title="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy">Albany Senior High School</a></li>

	<li><a title="http://wikieducator.org/Warrington_School/Board_Of_Trustees/Creative_Commons_Policy" href="http://wikieducator.org/Warrington_School/Board_Of_Trustees/Creative_Commons_Policy">Warrington School</a></li>

</ul>

Other schools to use Creative Commons licensing include Tawa Intermediate and Wellington High School.
