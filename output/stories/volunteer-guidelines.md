<html><body><p>Thanks for considering donating your time and expertise to Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ), a project hosted by the Open Education Resource Foundation (OERF). The guidelines, below, are for volunteers who are considering writing for CCANZ or ‘adopting an organisation’ to support Creative Commons licence adoption in your local community. We’ll update these guidelines as needed.

</p><h3>General guidelines</h3>

1. Please note that volunteer assignments with CCANZ are unpaid. In addition, volunteer positions do not compete with or replace paid positions at CCANZ.



2. Each volunteer agrees that they are not an employee or contractor of CCANZ or the OERF.



3. As a volunteer, you won’t be speaking on behalf of CCANZ – rather, you’ll be working with us to advocate for and implement open licensing across New Zealand. Volunteers are not agents of CCANZ or OERF and cannot bind or speak for either of them, unless otherwise directed.



4. CCANZ may be able to reimburse volunteers for any out of pocket expenses accrued while volunteering. Please note that these must be agreed upon in advance with the Public Lead of CCANZ.



5. As a volunteer, you agree to work remotely, unless otherwise agreed with the Public Lead of CCANZ.



6. While volunteers will generally be expected to have prior knowledge of both copyright and Creative Commons licensing, we can provide volunteers with introductory training and resources, such as slides or handouts.



7. Volunteer activities will be coordinated by CCANZ staff. Volunteers will be expected to report back to CCANZ, so we can keep track of our progress.



8. CCANZ will recognise volunteer contributions on the CCANZ ‘Volunteer’ page. To ensure that we are actually representing our project, volunteers that are inactive for six months will be moved to a ‘alumni’ section. Volunteers can also step down at any time.



9. CCANZ is not a law firm, and does not give legal advice. As such, volunteers should not purport to provide legal advice or offer legal services. More generally, if you don’t know the answer to a question, say so, and pass the question to CCANZ staff.



10. CCANZ is a project of the Open Education Resource Foundation, which is a registered charity in New Zealand. As such, we are restricted to charitable education activities, and are specifically restricted from engaging in political lobbying.



11. Each volunteer agrees to understand and comply with CCANZ's and OERF's reasonably directions, policies and procedures, including privacy, confidentiality, health and safety, communications and use of computer systems.



12. Copyright in works produced by volunteers in the course of their assignment remains with the volunteers. However, volunteers agree that all works submitted to publication to a CCANZ owned website will be automatically assigned a Creative Commons Attribution licence, or another Creative Commons licence, as agreed with CCANZ staff. CCANZ encourages other work produced by CCANZ volunteers to be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution licence.



13. At the end of the assignment for any reason the volunteer must promptly return all CCANZ or OERF property to CCANZ in good working order and condition, fair wear and tear excepted.

<h3>‘Adopt an organisation’ volunteer guidelines</h3>

14. Volunteers to ‘adopt an organisation’ will work with CCANZ staff to make initial contact with an organisation in their local community. At this stage, we are assisting volunteers who are interested in working with schools, though we are open to other suggestions.



15. As a volunteer in the schools sector, you will be supporting CCANZ’s goal of seeing every school in Aotearoa New Zealand passing and implementing a Creative Commons policy and using Creative Commons licensing to share open educational resources.



16. Your role will be to educate and support staff who are interested in understanding and using Creative Commons policies and licences. Note that your role will not be to ‘sell’ or ‘push’ Creative Commons policies and licences.



17. Specific tasks are difficult to predict in advance. You may be asked to provide guidance via email, present on CC to staff, and meet with school leaders. You may also be asked to speak with students. CCANZ staff can provide resources, such as slides or handouts, to support your work. CCANZ also has staff and paid regional facilitators in the main centres, who can assist you if required.



18. Remember to let the staff of your adopted organisation decide what level of support they need. Be aware that some organisations may not be ready for your help, or may not need it.</body></html>
