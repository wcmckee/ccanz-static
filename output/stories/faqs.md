More information about Creative Commons can be found on the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org" target="_self">international Creative Commons portal</a>.



The Creative Commons project in New Zealand was initiated Te Whainga Aronui The Council for the Humanities, and is now administered by <a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/" target="_self">The Royal Society of New Zealand</a>. Australia has its <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au" target="_self">own CC project</a>, and there are many others through the world.[/toggle]

The problem is that no copyright notice is required to be attached, so it is difficult for creators to declare their copyright intentions. It is also difficult for people who want to use and reuse creative works to identify how such works are available. To solve both problems, CC provides the following tools:

<ul>

	<li>A set of free public licences sturdy enough to withstand a court’s scrutiny,</li>

	<li>Simple enough for non-lawyers to understand and use</li>

	<li>Yet sophisticated enough to be identified by various Web applications</li>

	<li>Noncommercial. Permit others to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work and derivative works based upon it only for noncommercial purposes.</li>

CC’s licences help you keep your copyright while allowing you to decide on what conditions others can use your work. In fact, CC’s licences rely upon copyright for their enforcement – just like the GNU General Public Licence. The justification for intellectual property protection is the ‘promot[ion of] the progress of science and the useful arts’. CC wants to promote science and the useful arts, too, and believe that helping creators fine-tune the exercise of their rights to suit their preferences helps do just that.[/toggle]

CC International was started as an offshoot of the original licensing project, in order to oversee the internationalisation of the Creative Commons idea.[/toggle]

Some people may be attracted by the notion of others building upon their work, or by the prospect of contributing to an intellectual commons. As the CC community grows, licensors will have the satisfaction of helping develop new ways to collaborate. Others may wish to encourage distribution of their creative work. Examples include:

<ul>

	<li>Scholars might want writings to be copied and shared to easily spread ideas.</li>

	<li>Designers can encourage the unfettered dissemination of sketches to build reputations.</li>

	<li>Established commercial musicians might post samples to whet the public’s appetite for other, fully protected songs.</li>

	<li>Political activists may want messages to reach the widest possible audience through unlimited copying.</li>

</ul>

CC licences can help implement such strategies, while leaving you in ultimate control of your copyright.

Yes, absolutely. The ‘noncommercial use’ condition applies only to others who use your work, not to you (the copyright holder). When other people use or trade or copy your work, they cannot do so for ‘monetary compensation or financial gain’, unless they get your permission.



One of CC’s central goals is to encourage people to experiment with new ways to promote and market their work. In fact, CC designed the noncommercial licence option to be a tool to help people make money from their work, by allowing them to maximise the distribution of their works while keeping control of the commercial aspects of their copyright.



Take this example: You license your photograph with a noncommercial licence and post it on your website. An editor at Spectacle, a for-profit magazine, comes across your photo and wants to use it for the next issue’s cover. Under the noncommercial term, the editor could copy your photograph and show it to her friends and co-workers, but she would have to strike a separate deal with you (for money, if you are smart) to use it for the magazine.



However, you need to be careful: once a copy of your work is out under a CC licence, you CANNOT STOP its further distribution for noncommercial purposes for free. This means that if you are to make money you have to find a way to do it while people can find copies of your work on the Internet for free.

The ‘commercial use’ licences, however, do not do so; they allow royalty-free use by anyone. Thus, in practice, only work issued under a ‘noncommercial’ form of licence could also be registered with a royalty collection organisation. However, it is a matter for people to clarify with particular collection organisations, not all of which have the same policies. Accordingly, individual artists who are registered with a collection organisation should consult with it to establish their rights.[/toggle]

There is one combination of options that does not make sense: No Derivative Works combined with Share Alike. This combination does not work because the Share Alike condition applies only to derivative works (called “adaptations” in the New Zealand Copyright Act). If you choose both options, CC will give you a friendly reminder about this and ask that you please make your selection again. Note that every CC licence requires licensees to attach the original licence terms to every verbatim copy they distribute. So if you copy a music file licensed under a noncommercial licence, you must tell the world that your copy of that file is also licensed under a noncommercial licence. The Share Alike option simply extends this requirement to all derivative works as well. So if you were to use that same noncommercial MP3 in a documentary film, the Share Alike provision would oblige you to license your film under a noncommercial licence, too.[/toggle]

However, CC feels that there are advantages to switching to a New Zealand licence if you live in New Zealand. These licences have been designed to be fully compatible with national contract and copyright law. Some benefits from using a New Zealand licence would be:

<ul>

	<li>their plain English language; easier to understand than the American legal language of the generic licences;</li>

	<li>because they follow national contract and copyright law, they offer explicit protection of your ‘moral rights’;</li>

	<li>the support offered by the New Zealand project;</li>

	<li>in the very unlikely event of any dispute over the terms of the licence, they provide that this should be heard in the courts of your own country.</li>

[tab:About Copyright]

<h4><span style="color:#000000;">About Copyright:</span></h4>

[toggle title_open="What is copyright?" title_closed="What is copyright?" hide="yes" border="yes" style="default" excerpt_length="0" read_more_text="Read More" read_less_text="Read Less" include_excerpt_html="no"]



Copyright is a system to promote the creation of, and access to artistic, literary, musical, dramatic and other creative productions. In principle, the creator, i.e. the author, maker or artist, etc. has the exclusive right to authorise or to prevent copying. In practice, the power to control copying more frequently devolves to publishers and distributors to whom the creators have assigned their rights. In New Zealand, it is regulated by statute; the main statute is the Copyright Act 1994 (referred to here as the Copyright Act for short).



The Copyright Act is usually presented as a balance between promoting the public interest by encouraging the dissemination of works of the arts and intellect, and obtaining a just reward for the copyright holder (or, more accurately, to prevent someone other than the holder from appropriating whatever benefits may be generated). For this reason, the exclusive rights of copyright holders, sometimes called monopoly rights, are subject to certain limitations in favour of public access for ‘fair dealing’, such as news reporting, research, criticism or private study, or for other purposes, such as archiving by an Archive.



The proper balance lies not only in recognising the copyright holder’s rights but in giving due weight to their limited nature. In crassly economic terms it would be as inefficient to overcompensate artists and authors for the right of reproduction as it would be self-defeating to undercompensate them. Excessive control by holders of copyrights and other forms of intellectual property may unduly limit the ability of the public domain to incorporate and embellish creative innovation in the long-term interests of society as a whole, or create practical obstacles to proper utilisation.

No, there are several requirements to claim copyright protection.



First, a work must fit into one of the categories of works in the Copyright Act, it must be: a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work, a sound recording, a film, a broadcast or cable programme, a typographical arrangement of a published edition or a derivative work (or adaptation) of any of these.



Second, the Copyright Act requires that most works must be recorded, in writing or some other tangible form, meaning that only the expression of an idea but not the idea itself can be protected by copyright. Simplified, this means, for example, the plot of a book in the writer’s head could not be protected by copyright, but the manuscript incorporating the plot could. The claim is not to ideas, but to the order of words, and this order has a marked identity and a more or less permanent endurance.



Third, the work must be ‘original’. The legal definition of originality has given rise to considerable difficulty but it is generally agreed that ‘originality’ in copyright does not mean that the work must be the expression of original or inventive thought, but only with the expression of thought that results from the exertion of sufficient skill and effort. The Act does not require that the expression must be in an original or novel form, but that it should originate from the author and not from another work.

Copyright exists once a work is made, (e.g. once a sound recording is made or once a performance or broadcast signal occurs). The copyright remains in full force whether or not it is registered[/toggle]

In New Zealand, copyright in most works lasts until the end of the year the author dies plus 50 years.

For example, if a poet published a poem in 1922 and lived another eighty years, her poem would not enter the public domain until December 31, 2053; so a total of 131 years. However, if the same poet died in 1934, her poem would have already entered the public domain in 1985.



In New Zealand the copyright in sound recordings, films, broadcasts and cable programmes lasts for 50 years after they are released. The copyright in a typographical arrangement lasts 25 years.



These durations are valid for every work which is originated in New Zealand. Others will be protected for the term for which it is granted protection in its country of origin.

The key terms of the core suite of Creative Commons licences are: Attribution, Noncommercial, No Derivative Works and Share Alike:



Attribution=you must attribute the author and/or licensor in the manner they require.

Noncommercial=you may not use the work in a manner primarily directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

No Derivative Works=you may only make verbatim copies of the work, you may not adapt or change it.

Share Alike=you may only make derivative works if you license them under the same Creative Commons licence terms.

The “Noncommercial” licence option means that you do not receive the commercial rights via the Creative Commons licence. You can always approach the licensor directly to see if they will separately license you the commercial rights.[/toggle]

If you use a Creative Commons licensed work contrary to the terms of the Creative Commons licence, your right to use the work terminates and you could be sued for infringement of copyright.[/toggle]

In the case of Creative Commons licensed works that are licensed for Noncommercial use only, the creator or licensor reserves the right to collect statutory royalties or royalties under compulsory licences for commercial uses such as those collected for public performances; so, you may still have to pay a collecting society for such uses of Creative Commons licensed works. However, these are indirect payments, not payments to the licensor.[/toggle]

If you are using a work licensed under Creative Commons:

<ol>

	<li>Keep intact any copyright notices for the work.</li>

	<li>Credit the author, licensor and/or other parties (such as a wiki or journal) in the manner they specify and refer to the license they have chosen.</li>

</ol>

If you are making a derivative use of a work licensed under CC, you need to identify that your work is a derivative work, ie. “This is a Finnish translation of the [original work] by [author]” or “Screenplay based on [original work] by [author].”

A derivative work is a work that is based on another work but is not an exact, verbatim copy. In general, translation from one language to another or a film version of a book are examples of derivative works. Under Creative Commons’ licences, synching music in timed-relation with a moving image is considered to be a derivative work.



It's important to note, however, that the Creative Commons licences allow the user to exercise the rights permitted under the licence in any format or media, even in the No Derivative Works licences. This means that, under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works licence, for example, you can copy the work from a digital file to a print file consistent with the terms of that licence.

[toggle title_open="If I use a Creative Commons licensed work with other works, do I have to Creative Commons license everything else as well?" title_closed="If I use a Creative Commons licensed work with other works, do I have to Creative Commons license everything else as well?" hide="yes" border="yes" style="default" excerpt_length="0" read_more_text="Read More" read_less_text="Read Less" include_excerpt_html="no"]



With the exception of those of our licences that contain the Share Alike element, the Creative Commons licences do not require everything else to be Creative Commons licensed as well. We specifically designed the Creative Commons licences so that they would not turn all other works they were combined with into being Creative Commons licensed. If you combine any work with a Creative Commons licensed work that is licensed with a Share Alike licence provision, then, because of the way that the Share Alike licence element operates, the resultant work will need to be licensed under the same licence as the original work.



If you include a Creative Commons licensed work in a “collective work” (ie. a collection of works in their exact original format, not adaptations), then you only need to continue to apply the Creative Commons licence to that work (even if the work was licensed under a Creative Commons Share Alike licence provision). You do not need to apply it to the entire collection.

Generally yes; you can combine one Creative Commons licensed work with another Creative Commons licensed work or with another unlicensed work.



It is not that simple for Creative Commons licences that contain the Share Alike licence element (ie. Attribution-Share Alike, Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike). These licences require derivative works (ie. the result of two combined works) to be licensed under the same licence elements. So, you cannot, for example, combine an Attribution-Share Alike licence with an Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike. If you are combining a work licensed under a Share Alike licence condition, you need to make sure that you are happy and able to license the resulting work under the same licence conditions as the original work.
