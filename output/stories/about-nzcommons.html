<h5>Welcome!</h5>
<p>Welcome to NZCommons, a community website managed and edited by Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand and by the NZCommons editorial board (see below). NZCommons is dedicated to discussing the opportunities and challenges of opening New Zealand’s culture and knowledge for access and reuse, with a particular focus on copyright, licensing and the public domain.</p>
<p>NZCommons aims to encourage more informed discussion about copyright and licensing.  It also aims to grow and cross-pollinate the various open movements in Aotearoa New Zealand, while offering information and support for those individuals and organisations looking to open their work for sharing and reuse.</p>
<p>You can also find us on <a title="Tumblr" href="http://nzcommons.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>.</p>

<p>NZCommons is managed and edited by the staff of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand -- but this doesn't mean that every piece has to be related to Creative Commons. Ultimately the nature of the site will depend on the people who volunteer to write for it. This is where you come in. We’re looking for contributors from a range of backgrounds, particularly in the areas of education, research, data, heritage, arts and copyright.</p>

<h5>About Creative Commons</h5>

<p>Creative Commons is a non-profit organisation that helps people share their copyright works for reuse by others. Sometimes creators and other copyright holders want the public to be able to reuse their works but are unable to allow reuse easily and legally given the works’ “All Rights Reserved” copyright status. Creative Commons licences enable copyright holders to allow reuse of their works by giving everyone a range of permissions in advance.</p>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is the kaitiaki of the New Zealand Creative Commons licences that enable the voluntary sharing of copyright material in Aotearoa. We’re a kiwi remix on an international movement toward open access licensing and are here to support the use Creative Commons licences in New Zealand.</p>

<h5>NZCommons Editorial Board</h5>

<h6><b>Philothea Flynn</b></h6>

<p>Phil has a decade of experience working with copyright, indigenous and moral rights for <a href="http://www.teara.govt.nz/">Te Ara the Encyclopedia of New Zealand</a> and <a href="http://www.ngataonga.org.nz/">Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision</a> (formerly the New Zealand Film Archive). She worked with the integration of <a href="https://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/">NZGOAL</a> for Manatū Taonga the Ministry of Culture and Heritage, and advised on the adaption of Creative Commons licensing for Te Ara. She has a deep interest in Open Access and helping to make material more accessible and useable, and doing so in a way that acknowledges rights -- particularly indigenous and moral rights.</p>
<h6><b>Nigel Robertson</b></h6>

<p>Nigel leads the elearning and digital literacies team at Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato the University of Waikato, where he encourages the use of open resources and the development of open materials. This goes with developing understandings of openness and its role in education and society. Nigel views openness as something more than being free and more than being available; it should be an attitude, something of the heart.</p>
<h6><b>Anton Angelo</b></h6>

<p>Anton works at the University of Canterbury Library as the repository manager, and also helps out with policy relating to copyright and scholarly publishing. Has has had a long involvement with Free/Libre Open Source software as a user from his days working in the UK in the nineties, and then in NZ universities from the mid 2000's. He wrote a PG Dip dissertation on Librarians and FLOSS a few years back, and that led to a career in Librarianship. He graduated with his Masters in Information Studies in 2014, and his report was on difficulties with institutional repository analytics. Anton believes that copyright, as it stands, is broken, and that we need to show leadership in a modern way for people to protect their work and share it at the same time.</p>
<h6><b>Mike Riversdale</b></h6>

<p>Mike explains stuff, connects people and gets things done. He saw the web as the way in the early 1990s and was an advocate of Web 2.0 (the "cloud") in the 2000s, before co-founding, growing, and selling New Zealand's earliest dedicated Google Enterprise Partner, WaveAdept. Now he helps start-ups to become survivalists, Government agencies to realise the value in open data, and communities to “do their thang” with hackathons and events. Mike co-hosts the popular Kiwi tech podcast, <i>Access Granted.</i></p>
<h6><b>Shane Cummings</b></h6>

<p>Shane is the Editor-in-Chief at NZME Educational Media in Wellington, an author, and an independent publisher. He has a decade of experience in other media and publishing roles in Australia. As an author, he has published a dozen books, all of which are DRM (digital rights management)-free. Shane believes that authors have the right to distribute their work in any way they wish; that they should receive fair compensation for material they charge for; and they should receive due creative commons protection for material they choose to share.</p>
<h6><b>Karaitiana Taiuru</b></h6>

<p>Karaitiana is on the Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand Advisory Board and has offered his time to fill a need for an Indigenous voice, while we secure a more permanent person. He has a background in Web and Internet which he uses to promote te reo Māori and further enhance Māori development.</p>
<h6><b>Andy Neale</b></h6>

<p>Andy has long been associated with Creative Commons in an informal capacity through his work at DigitalNZ. He is based at the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa, where he works to help make NZ digital material more widely available for reuse; including encouraging their 170 partners to use Creative Commons licensing where possible. He also helped set up the Mix and Mash challenges that encouraged people to create new works from open NZ content and data. Andy is the current board member of the National Digital Forum.</p>
<h6><b>Richard White</b></h6>

<p>Richard is the copyright officer at the University of Otago Te Whare Wānanga o Otāgo. He is also a CC-licensing musician, performing under the pseudonym <a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/">mermaidguitar</a>. Richard believes that we're at a real crossroads for copyright and freedom of knowledge and we need to enhance people's understanding of their own rights and the implications of decisions made now that last for years into the future.</p>
<h6><b>Tim McNamara</b></h6>

<p>Tim is a communications/technology hybrid with an academic academic background in public policy. He recently left the New Zealand eScience Infrastructure to be part of a startup focused on translating data into stories, called <a href="http://www.dotlovesdata.com/">DOT Loves Data</a>. He has spent time working with Open Knowledge and sees his role on the the board as being a bit of an advocate for 're-users'. Tim also produces CC-licensed work personally; mainly non-fiction, photography and the visual arts, as well as open source software.</p>
<h6><b>Jo Wheway</b></h6>

<p>Jo works in education and tries to bring open collaboration and access into her school and wider school community. She believes strongly in open culture as the way to move students forward into a world unlike anything we can yet imagine. Jo is very excited to help support and promote open culture across a country that is already a world leader for being at the cutting edge in so many areas.</p>
<p><strong>We are also grateful for the support of our partners, Land Information New Zealand and InternetNZ, and our affiliate host, the Open Education Resource Foundation.</strong></p>
