<p></p>
<p>In July 2013, Lincoln University passed <a href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/About/Policies/Open-Access-Policy/" target="_blank">a wide-ranging Open Access policy</a>, becoming the first New Zealand university to do so. Coverage includes research outputs including data, teaching materials and the University’s business records.</p>
<p>The policy states that “as an organisation Lincoln University has a policy position which endorses making content openly and freely available as the first and preferred option.” It goes on to state that "Lincoln University takes a broad ethical position which asserts that if public funding has supported the creation of an idea, research or other content then it is reasonable and fair that it be made publicly accessible.”</p>
<p>The policy also encourages copyright owners “to apply a Creative Commons Licence to their intellectual output to determine how material may be used, reused or repurposed.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/staff-profile?staffId=Penny.Carnaby" target="_blank">Penny Carnaby, the University Librarian at Lincoln</a>, had been aware of the benefits of open access and open licensing since her time as National Librarian at the National Library of New Zealand (NLNZ), where she participated in the Chief Executives’ steering group on open data and information during the development of <a href="https://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/" target="_blank">NZGOAL</a>.</p>
<p>Approved by Cabinet in 2010, NZGOAL -- the New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework -- supports and advocates for the uptake of Creative Commons licensing for copyright works produced or funded by State Services agencies.</p>
<p>From her experience at NLNZ, Penny became particularly interested in opening up copyright works produced by the university sector -- including journal articles, datasets and educational resources. She also noted the growing importance of <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/institutional-repositories-101/" target="_blank">Institutional Repositories</a> in research libraries around the world as a way of ensuring much greater public access to the intellectual output of an academic institution. Penny had been at National Library when the network of IRs was established, along with the NLNZ managed <a href="http://www.nzresearch.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZResearch</a>, which uses a DigitalNZ powered harvester to gather information from research deposited in repositories across the New Zealand research sector and make them easier to find.</p>
<p>Noting the strength of <a href="posts/2014/10/09/www.researcharchive@lincoln.ac.nz." target="_blank">Lincoln’s Institutional Repository, LURA,</a> Penny began to investigate what it would take to develop an open access policy at Lincoln -- New Zealand’s first -- in line with other universities around the world. The policy was given strong support from the Vice Chancellor, Dr Andrew West, who nominated open access as a business driver for the university in 2013.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0-MfI4ma-U?rel=0&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]</p>
<p>This strong institutional support enabled a process of consultation across the university, which gave university staff an opportunity to voice concerns before the policy was approved. The university also developed a joint union and management working party, which spent six months working through issues and developing a final policy that the university community could be comfortable with.</p>
<p>Penny notes that research staff were, generally speaking, comfortable with the principle of open scholarship, as they could see the inherent benefits of OA to disseminating their research to a broader audience.</p>
<p>The same was not true of open educational resources, which was a relatively novel concept to most teaching staff. “Academics are generally dual professionals,” Penny points out. “Each profession -- teaching and research -- has different drivers. Researchers are often fundamentally motivated by the desire to see their published works have a broad public impact. We found that the same is not necessarily true of academic teaching resources.</p>
<p>“In the end, we developed an elegant and respectful solution: the copyright to educational resources would remain with the creator, while the university would retain the right to use these resources for the educational purposes of the institution -- such as using them as open educational resources in MOOCs.”</p>
<p>Penny notes that this process of discussion and consultation was both the most important and most difficult part of implementing open access across the university.</p>
<p>In order to support the implementation process, <a href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/About/News/Current-news/Te-Wiki--Open-Access-Week-events/" target="_blank">Lincoln held its Open Access Week in July</a>, holding several public events, including a talk by Dr Mark Hahnel, CEO of <a href="http://figshare.com/" target="_blank">Figshare</a>, and a debate on Open Access, with the moot 'Open Access or Open Slather?' Penny was placed on the 'Open Slather' team, and <a title="Researcher’s Lament" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/pennys-poem/" target="_blank">presented this poem as part of her argument</a>).</p>
<p>These events helped expose awareness gaps in the institution, which a university wide implementation group is helping to address.</p>
<p>Penny advises other other institutions developing an OA policy to “make the policy itself as broad as possible -- including not only research articles but educational resources and even public records. Institutions will also need to develop the policies alongside other, existing policy settings, such as data management and intellectual property.”</p>
<p>“And then think very carefully about implementation. Implementation is everything.” At Lincoln, this process of implementing the policy has led to -- at last count -- eighty-seven discrete activities across the university.</p>
<p>“Open Access changes every conversation you have,” says Penny. “Rather than arguing why works need to be open, the focus at Lincoln University is on why certain works need to be closed. This requires a massive cultural shift to take place.”</p>

             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2014-10-07T14:38:17+13:00">2014-10-07 14:38</time>
</h1>
        <div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p></p>
<p>On 4 March 2014, the University of Waikato <a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/news-events/media/2014/03university-of-waikato-approves-open-access-mandate-guidelines.shtml" target="_blank">announced the passage of an open access mandate</a>, becoming the first university to adopt a direct deposit mandate in New Zealand, and the second university, after Lincoln, to adopt an institutional OA policy.</p>
<p>The primary principle driving the adoption of the policy, as stated on its opening line, is that “Freedom to exchange ideas and to publish acquired knowledge are fundamental to the purposes of a university.”</p>
<p>The policy represents the University of Waikato’s commitment “to the concept of open access to knowledge through the deposit of full text, academic publications into the University’s digital repository, the Research Commons, wherever possible.”</p>
<p>The momentum for the policy was established during <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/waikato.ac.nz/open-access-week-2012/panel-sessions" target="_blank">Open Access Week 2012,</a> when OA advocates Fabiana Kubke and Alex Holcombe spoke at a panel entitled, ‘An Open Access Mandate for the University of Waikato?’ The panel generated interest in OA from the university community, and led to David Nichols, Senior Lecturer in Computer Science, and Ross Hallett, University Librarian, to develop a detailed paper outlining the benefits, risks and options for an OA policy at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>In that paper, David and Ross deliberately provided the university with options as to what the final OA policy might look like. As David says, “We deliberately provided the university with a range of options and wording for the policy. We also made sure that we explicitly laid out the costs and benefits.”</p>
<p>In presenting the policy to groups within the university, David emphasised the importance of the digital visibility of the institution and noted the successful deposit mandate in place for student theses since 2006.</p>
<p>In terms of benefits, David and Ross pointed to the increased download rates, potential citation advantages, as well as the broader importance of making the university’s research available to the wider society, including industry, university alumni and professional groups, such as teachers and journalists.</p>
<p>David notes that higher ideals, such as the need for the public to have access to publicly funded research, were also emphasised during the consultation process. This ties in nicely with the motto of the university “Ko Te Tangata - For the People” -- a motto which ended up introducing the policy for its embodiment of the university’s “commitment to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible.”</p>
<p>After releasing the paper, it travelled for several months -- with David and Ross-- through the various committees of the university, a process which enabled staff from every school and faculty to provide comment and raise potential concerns.</p>
<p>One such concern was the question of what happens if infringing material is uploaded to the IR. Some academics were concerned about possible liability, should they mistakenly upload material for which they do not have the rights. They were reassured when told that Library repository staff would continue to offer a mediated deposit service, checking publisher copyright agreements for potential infringement before adding items to the repository.</p>
<p>The consultation process also provided the opportunity to clarify confusion around green and gold OA, as well as the names publishers give to document versions at different stages of the review process, such as ‘preprint’, ‘postprint’ and ‘published’.</p>
<p>David noted that it was also important for Waikato to include a waiver in their policy, for those publications that may not be appropriate for deposit in the IR. “It was important that the policy wasn’t seen as entirely black and white.”</p>
<p>According to the widely accepted OA colour scheme, Waikato’s policy is green, with no references to gold (or publisher-implemented) OA or Creative Commons licensing.</p>
<p>As David points out, “We’ve restricted the definition of OA for this policy to ‘read-only.’ The policy doesn’t engage with reuse rights at all. These are issues that we may be able to address in future revisions, though it was important that this policy took the simplest first step.</p>
<p>“A general notion of incrementalism was essential to the whole process, especially given the fact that scholarly publishing is a changing landscape, with many moving parts, including requirements from external funders.”</p>
<p>This incremental approach followed those taken by comparable institutions overseas, such as Queensland University to Technology, who have had a deposit mandate since 2004. David and Ross consulted with QUT during the development of the policy.</p>
<p>“QUT have also made public useful information about the progress of their policy over time, including graphs of the effects on deposit rates. Their model suggested that we needed to take a long term approach to implementing the policy -- there was never going to be an instant change. Progress will be gradual.”</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why Waikato didn’t follow the example of another leading OA institution, the University of Liège, which mandates that only works deposited in the Institutional Repository will be considered during internal promotion and review. While this is a good model for increasing the number of works in the IR, it is potentially less helpful for gaining support from researchers.</p>
<p>David is now working with the Library, Research Office and Information Technology Services to implement a new research information system -- called Symplectic Elements-- to help reduce the transaction costs of depositing research into the university’s repository.</p>
<p>As David pointed out, while the policy is important, the means of technically implementing the policy must be as smooth as possible. With the new system, the time commitment required by the academic to deposit an article should be no more than the time required to respond to an email request.</p>
<p>The new system will also help Waikato determine the baseline number of OA articles currently published by university staff, which will make it easier to chart progress in the years to come.</p>
<p>Ultimately, David underlines the importance of basing the OA efforts at the library. He also advises other institutions looking at OA to factor in a lot of consultation and listening to staff. As disciplines have their own norms and terminology, it’s also important to find advocates across the university’s various schools and faculties.</p>
<p>David also reiterates the importance of not trying to solve all the problems with scholarly publishing in one fell swoop. “The policy,” David says, “is just the first step.”</p>

<p>In the middle of the year, we launched <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZCommons</a>, a community site for information and discussion on opening New Zealand’s culture and knowledge for sharing and reuse. As the site develops, we want it to be of use to as many communities as possible, including teachers, librarians, data users, government employees, researchers, students, artists and more.</p>
<p>To ensure that we’re meeting the needs of all these communities, we’re looking to appoint a volunteer editorial board. The editorial board will set the general direction of NZCommons and help ensure that the site is consistently publishing relevant, high quality interviews, case studies, resources, opinion pieces -- and whatever else the inaugural board thinks the site needs.</p>
<p>The board will also provide links to potential contributors, and generally help ensure that NZCommons is a lively, informative place. We're hoping that it will have representatives from all the different sectors we're looking to help.</p>
<p>The board will have the opportunity to meet remotely every two months, and will keep in touch with each other and Creative Commons staff via an email list and Loomio group. We'll use the meeting to discuss ideas for the site, the email lists to suggest potential topics and contributors and Loomio to make decisions.</p>
<p>The positions are voluntary, with a low time commitment -- though we would like the inaugural editorial board to commit to staying involved for at least twelve months.</p>

<h3>Introducing our new Communications Lead</h3>

This month <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/09/introducing-our-new-communications-lead/">Elizabeth Heritage</a> has joined Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand as our new Comms Lead. Elizabeth joins us from the publishing industry and will be working two days a week. Welcome!

<h3>We've Moved!</h3>

The <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/07/were-moving-to-the-oer-foundation/">new affiliate host</a> of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home">Open Education Resource Foundation</a>. Many thanks to our previous affiliate host, the Royal Society of New Zealand, for all their support over the past four years. We've also moved into our new offices with <a href="http://www.enspiral.com/">the team at Enspiral.</a>

<h3>Announcing NZCommons</h3>

In June, we launched <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/">NZCommons.org.nz</a>, a community site on copyright and the commons. Every week, we'll be publishing a few pieces from teachers, librarians, students, lawyers and more. If you're keen to write for us, we'd love to have you! Check out <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/contribute/">our contribute page</a> for more information.

<h3>Workshops</h3>

We're excited to offer free introductory workshops on copyright and Creative Commons licensing. We’re a small organisation, so we can’t promise to visit your organisation on the exact date you need us to, but we’ll certainly do our best. If we can’t make it in person, we’re happy to attend virtually, or find a local volunteer from the Creative Commons community. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/workshops/">Use this online form</a> to express your interest in hosting a workshop.

<h3>WW1 photographs made available for free reuse</h3>

The Alexander Turnbull Library has released hundreds of photographs of New Zealanders at the front for free download and reuse. You can find them on the excellent <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/">WW100 site</a>and <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/photographing-new-zealanders-at-war">read more here</a>.

<h3>Te Papa releases tens of thousands of images online</h3>

The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa has <a href="http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2014/06/03/free-downloadable-images-from-te-papas-collections/">updated its Collections Online service</a>, releasing nearly forty thousand images as freely downloadable in high-res. <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/">Check out NZCommons</a> in the weeks ahead for a detailed case study.

<h3>National Library develops new use and reuse policy</h3>

The National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa has a <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/about-us/strategy-and-policy/collection-use-and-reuse-policy">new policy around use and reuse</a> of collection items that aims to increase digital access. <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/blog/posts/our-new-use-and-reuse-policy">Read more here</a>.

<h3>Open Access Week 20-26 October 2014</h3>

<a href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/">Open Access Week 2014</a> is nearly upon us! Events will be happening around the country. If you're making something happen at your place, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/contact/">let us know</a>. Stay tuned for further updates.

<h3>National Digital Forum Conference 25-26 November 2014</h3>

The <a href="http://www.ndf.org.nz/programme/">2014 National Digital Forum conference</a> will take place at Te Papa on 25 and 26 November, and there are many CC related talks, panels and workshops. A draft programme is out now.

<h3>Indigenous Knowledge Notice</h3>

Working with CC Panel Member Karaitiana Taiuru, CC Legal Team member Professor Susy Frankel and Aroha Mead from Victoria University of Wellington, we're working on developing an indigenous knowledge notice that will help Māori creators, iwi and hapūrelease their works more openly. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/06/towards-an-indigenous-knowledge-notice/">Learn more here.</a>

<h3>Creative Commons Around the World</h3>

Creative Commons has published its annual report, <a href="http://teamopen.cc/thefuture/">The Future Is Open</a>, with loads of inspiring stories from around the world. And here are some international stories that have caught our eye: Yale University and the Library of Congress <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/seeing-the-great-depression/379238/">have released around 175,000 images</a> of Depression-era USA. The Danish Government has <a href="https://www.openaire.eu/newsletter-items/denmark-ambitious-oa-goals">announced its open access strategy</a>, aiming for 80% open access by 2017 and 100% by 2022. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a> has recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, with more than 22 million images available that anyone can use freely. Happy birthday, Wikimedia! The Internet Archive <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/2014/08/29/welcome-the-internet-archive-to-the-commons/">has shared over 14 million high-res images</a> on Flickr Commons. <a href="http://openstax.org/">Open Stax</a> open textbooks have been downloaded more than 650,000 times, adopted for use in nearly 900 courses, saving students US $13 million.

<h3>We're Looking for Volunteers</h3>

<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is looking for casual workshop facilitators based in Auckland, Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin.</p>
<p>Creative Commons is helping to roll out open policy to every school, research and heritage institution in New Zealand -- but to do this, we’re going to need some help.</p>
<p>We’re looking for confident, articulate candidates who can commit to providing one to two workshops per month. Successful candidates will be paid a standard rate of $100 per workshop provided, though should note that this work is very casual, and will depend on local demand.</p>
<p>These positions won’t pay the rent, but they're a great opportunity to help grow the Commons in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>Candidates should have their own form of transport, or be able to get around their home city to local schools, research and heritage institutions.</p>
<p>We’ll provide some training and all the materials you’ll need, though a working knowledge of copyright and Creative Commons is desirable. You should also have some public speaking experience.</p>
<p>We’re also building a pool of (unfortunately unpaid) volunteers who can commit to providing a workshop or writing for our community site, NZCommons.org.nz, every two or three months. If you’re keen to volunteer, let us know on your application.</p>
<p>Please send us a short CV and a quick cover letter outlining your interest in helping out CC.</p>
<p>We’re looking for facilitators based in Auckland, Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin. Applicants based in other regions are welcome to apply, though should note there is unlikely to be much work available outside of the main centres.</p>
<p>Applications close 8 October 2014.</p>

<p>Kia ora everyone, my name is Elizabeth Heritage and I’m the new Communications Lead here at Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ. Today’s my first day and I’m really excited to get started!</p>
<p>I’m a British Kiwi and have lived in the UK and NZ. I’m a publisher by trade, although I have also been a policy advisor, intellectual property officer and librarian. I have a keen interest in practical copyright from both consumer and commercial points of view, and am really looking forward to getting stuck in to the creative commons landscape here in Aotearoa. As a publisher, I’m particularly interested in the ways creative commons can be applied to books, especially ebooks, so do get in touch if you have thoughts or experiences to share on that front.</p>
<p>I’ll be at CCANZ here in Wellington two days a week - you can contact me on <a href="mailto:elizabeth@creativecommons.org.nz">elizabeth@creativecommons.org.nz</a>. When I’m not here, I’m probably either reading (my lifelong passion) or out and about helping make books happen, working freelance with publishers and authors.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to meeting the creative commons community and getting to know you and what you’re up to, so please do drop me a line to introduce yourself.</p>
<p>Ngā mihi nui, na Elizabeth</p>

<p>On behalf of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, I'm excited to announce that we're moving affiliate hosts to the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resource Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>This will mark the end of our four year affiliate relationship with the Royal Society of New Zealand.</p>
<p>CCANZ came to the Royal Society in 2010, after the Council for the Humanities – the original affiliate host – joined the Society.</p>
<p>Under the umbrella of the Royal Society, CCANZ has gone from strength to strength. We've seen a rapid increase in CC licence adoption across Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>Most of the CC community won't notice the difference. We'll still be based in Wellington, and we'll still be actively spreading the word about CC all around the country.</p>
<p>A big thanks to the Royal Society of New Zealand for hosting CCANZ for the last four years, and a equally big thanks to the OER Foundation for agreeing to be our new affiliate hosts.</p>
<p>Thanks also to Wayne Mackintosh of the OER Foundation and Fabiana Kubke, Chair of the CCANZ Panel, who have been working tirelessly to make this happen, as have the rest of the CCANZ Panel. A final thanks to Andrew Matangi from the Legal Team for providing ongoing advice.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we've got plenty of projects in the pipeline -- and plenty more ideas -- so watch out for more announcements in the weeks and months ahead. </p>
