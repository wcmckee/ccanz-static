<h5>By Holly Grover</h5>
<p>In July 2009, the <a href="http://www.mfe.govt.nz/index.html" target="_blank">Ministry for the Environment</a> started to release its datasets under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution</a> licence, becoming one of the first New Zealand government agencies to do so.</p>
<p>The process started in 2007, when MfE found themselves with a range of expiring license agreements for the distribution of some of their datasets. These databases were distributed and managed by a third party, who would charge a fee, register users, then get people to sign a license agreement before receiving the data. It was, in the words of Karl Majorhazi GISP-AP – Senior Analyst, simply “the way things were done.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not what we wanted,” Karl explains, “because when you invest in a database, the value of that is related to the number of users and uses it’s put to. So in the five years that that distribution agreement had been running, there were 99 registered users. And when you are looking to fund an update and you’ve only got 99 users it doesn’t make the maths look good.”</p>
<p>At this time, the State Services Commission was beginning to look into the use of Creative Commons licenses. Karl sat in on SSC meeting with<a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/" target="_blank"> Creative Commons Australia</a> Project Lead Anne Fitzgerald, of the Queensland University of Technology Faculty of Law.</p>
<p>Following this meeting, the decision to move to Creative Commons licensing was rather straightforward. “We tested it out, got some advice on what it is, what it could be used for what it couldn’t, and eventually we came to the decision that this was the way to go.”</p>
<p>The second piece of the puzzle was an online data platform <a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/4317-environmental-limiting-factors/#/maps/environment/">Koordinates</a>, launched only a few months earlier, which provided an easy way to search, sort, and share the datasets.</p>
<p>The Ministry’s first release was on 1 July 2009, and it didn’t take long for the data to be used in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>“We had a request from a company in Germany who were making a flight simulator app for the iPhone, who wanted to know if they could use the Landcover database in their system to give a more feature rich environment for anyone that’s flying over the country.” Of course, they didn’t need to ask as, unlike past arrangements, “the license terms and conditions mean there’s no reason why they can’t.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/land/land-cover-dbase/" target="_blank">The Landcover database</a> went from 99 registered users to over 2000 downloads, as researchers, students and members of the public began to freely use the data.</p>
<p>Recently, Karl had a phone call from someone “who was looking at the watershed data that we provide as part of the Marine Environment Classification. He was using that for a search and rescue project, using the watersheds to determine where people get lost and found. That’s one of these unintended reuses that you don’t plan for when you are developing this database.”</p>
<p>Karl notes that one of the downsides of open data platforms is that you are unable to track users. Nevertheless, there have been several other exciting examples of high-value reuse of Ministry for the Environment data.</p>
<p>As Karl explains, “I turned up at a seminar and a colleague of mine came bounding over from the other side of the room with a big smile on his face and said ‘I’ve got a good news story for you!’ He operates a small consultancy and he was asked to turn around a quick analysis for parliament on how much it would roughly cost to dig trenches along side roads motorways to lay broadband cable.</p>
<p>“He couldn’t get access to the soil information from Landcare at the time because it was it was under wraps commercially, but he found a piece of research that tied to it the attributes in the Land Environment dataset. He managed to download that dataset, use it in his analysis and turn that job around.”</p>
<p>“That is a case where people could do the job they needed to do because the data was already there – it’s an argument for being proactive, not waiting until somebody requests it.”</p>

<p></p>
<p>Because some of our funding runs July to June, I tend to think of CCANZ's year starting on 1 July. So, to celebrate the new year, I thought I'd share some of what we've been up to over the last twelve months:<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3530" title="Remix Kiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="236"></a></p>
<p><strong>Talks &amp; Workshops </strong></p>
<p>Over these twelve months, CCANZ gave fifty-two talks and workshops. This included twenty-seven to schools, thirteen to Universities and CRIs, two to the data community, three to the culture and heritage sector and seven to non-profits and NGOs.</p>
<p><strong>Web Site</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>On 8 August 2012, we launched our new website (the one you're on). From this date to 30 June, we posted seventy-seven times. We announced events, blogged, hosted a bunch of guest posts for Open Access Week and, of course, published case studies of Creative Commons users.</p>
<p><strong>Case Studies </strong></p>
<p>From 1 July to 30 June, we published twenty-four case studies. The breakdown here was a little different than our talks and workshops: we published three case studies on schools, two on universities or CRIs, four on open data, three in the GLAM sector, three on non-profits or NGOs and nine on Creative Commons artists.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>
<p>We wrote, designed and distributed 12,000 A3 posters, 4,000 Free to Mix guides and 1000 A2 Creative Commons posters.</p>

<p>Last week saw the release of the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programmes/open-and-transparent-government/declaration-open-and-transparent-government/2013-report-adoption-declaration/" target="_blank">2013 Report on Agency Adoption of the Declaration on Open and Transparent Government</a>, which directs all Public Service departments (and others) to release their high value public data under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>The report noted that agency uptake of NZGOAL is steadily increasing, with sixty-nine percent of planned data releases to be licensed for legal reuse. Eighty-four percent of departments are including the Declaration in their core business planning.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Beehive.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4038 " title="Beehive" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Beehive.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="231"></a> "Beehive, Wellington, NZ" by Stewart Baird, via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sxbaird/6256220109/sizes/z/in/photostream/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. Made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non Commerical No Derivatives licence</a>.</p>
<p>This is good news. The potential effects of the open data programme, as stated in the Declaration itself, go far beyond the open data community. As the Declaration puts it, the point of releasing open data is “to enable the private and community sectors to use it to grow the economy, strengthen our social and cultural fabric, and sustain our environment. We release it to encourage business and community involvement in government decision-making.”</p>
<p>So, more open data is a Good Thing. But where can it be found? The first place to look for open government datasets is the appropriately named <a href="https://data.govt.nz/" target="_blank">data.govt.nz</a>. While data.govt.nz doesn’t host any datasets, it links to over 2300 datasets on other government websites; nearly 2000 of these are made available under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>The datasets give a range of information about New Zealand, including <a href="https://data.govt.nz/dataset/show/3230" target="_blank">2013 Budget Data</a> from Treasury to<a href="https://data.govt.nz/dataset/show/3073" target="_blank"> Child and Youth Prosecution Statistics</a> from the Ministry of Justice. More than half the datasets are provided by Land Information New Zealand, with many more datasets provided by Statistics New Zealand and Treasury.</p>
<p>Other sources of open data and content include <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a>, which links to 120 content partners across the country, and the award-winning <a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/" target="_blank">LINZ Data Service</a>, which allows users to 'layer' datasets onto an Open Street Map. We also have the folks at <a href="http://wikinewzealand.org/" target="_blank">Wiki New Zealand</a>--we profiled <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/02/wiki-new-zealand/" target="_blank">WikiNZ here</a>--who make a range of graphs from open government data.</p>
<p>If you can't find what you need, go to data.govt.nz and <a href="https://data.govt.nz/requests/" target="_blank">make a request</a>; otherwise, go to <a href="https://fyi.org.nz/" target="_blank">FYI.org.nz</a> to make a request under the Official Information Act.</p>
<p>If you make anything with the data you find--or even save time and energy by finding what you need--we'd love <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/contact/" target="_blank">to hear about it</a>!</p>

<a href="posts/2013/06/28/were-looking-for-winter-interns.html" class="u-url">We're Looking for Winter Interns</a>
             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2013-06-28T12:14:22+12:00">2013-06-28 12:14</time>

<p></p>
<h4>Who are you looking for?</h4>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) is looking for two paid interns to help out in July and August.</p>
<p>The first intern will be a talented designer or visual artist, keen to produce a range of CCANZ resources for print and the web.</p>
<p>The second intern will be a confident and engaging writer from either law, the humanities or related disciplines, willing to write blog posts, conduct interviews for Creative Commons case studies and help organise Mix &amp; Mash.</p>
<p>Both interns will be energetic supporters of open licensing and open culture, capable of working both collaboratively and independently. While all students are encouraged to apply, the successful candidates are likely to be in at least their third year of study.</p>
<h4>Where? When? And how much?</h4>

<h4><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3530" title="Remix Kiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="191"></a></h4>

<p>Interns will be paid $15 per hour. We hope to provide a total of at least 60 hours paid work. Interns will never be expected to work for free, though there may be opportunities to volunteer after the duration of the internship.</p>
<p>Ideally, the successful candidates will work between ten and twenty hours per week, between 8.30am and 3pm, at the Thorndon home of the Royal Society of New Zealand. Both interns will work under the direct supervision of the Public Lead for CCANZ. Ideally, the internship will run from July 12 to August 9, 2013, though as this is likely to overlap with the university semester, we are willing to flexible.</p>
<p>The successful candidates will be temporary employees of the Royal Society of New Zealand, which hosts the CCANZ project. Regrettably, CCANZ is unable to provide accommodation in Wellington, and candidates should note that their pay is unlikely to cover living costs in the Wellington area.</p>
<h4>What’s Creative Commons?</h4>

<p>CCANZ is the kaitiaki of the Creative Commons licences in Aotearoa New Zealand. We promote openness across culture, education, science and government. Browse our website for more information about what we do.</p>
<h4>What will I be doing?</h4>

<p>On top of some basic administrative tasks, you’ll be working on a number of exciting Creative Commons projects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing and designing a range of resources for CCANZ;</li>

    <li>writing blog posts on the CCANZ website;</li>

    <li>working with the CCANZ community;</li>

    <li>organising Creative Commons events;</li>

    <li>interviewing and writing case studies; and,</li>

    <li>helping to promote Mix &amp; Mash.</li>

</ul>
<p>You’ll also be involved in discussions with the Public Lead on what Creative Commons might do in the future.</p>
<h4>How do I apply?</h4>

<p>To apply, email Matt McGregor at matt.mcgregor@royalsociety.org.nz</p>
<p>Design or arts applicants should provide a short CV and portfolio or links to examples of your work.</p>
<p>Law and humanities applicants should provide a short CV and cover letter.</p>
<p>Applications close midnight, Wednesday July 10.</p>

<h5>By Matt McGregor</h5>
<p>Vicky Holloway is a web designer, animator and illustrator based in Wellington, New Zealand. Some of Vicky’s work is made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives licence</a>.</p>
<p>Vicky first became aware of Creative Commons in 2005, though it wasn’t until she joined a collaborative art project in 2009 that she seriously considered using Creative Commons licensing. As she says, “We were looking for ways to license our work so that we could share it with other people, and maybe take it further as a group project.”</p>
<p>While following the <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_blank">Mix &amp; Mash</a> competitions in 2010 and 2011, Vicky started using Creative Commons licences for <a href="http://www.behance.net/squibbleworld" target="_blank">her Behance portfolio</a>.</p>
<p>As she explains, Creative Commons licensing on Behance is “built into the process. You must choose a license before publishing your work and they make it easy to choose which CC license is the best for you.”</p>
<p>The benefit of using Creative Commons licences, Vicky says, is that “it explicitly states ‘this is how I want my work to be used.’ And it also gives a link to further information. The licences make it very straightforward and easy to understand. It makes it easy to tell people what kinds of use you are happy with—and also what kinds of use you’re not happy with.</p>
<p>“I love how the internet encourages curiosity and creativity. However, the rights of the artist should still be protected. A CC license allows me to state exactly what I want to happen to my work and comes with a clear label.</p>
<p>"A CC license also gives me the option to share while protecting my copyright. I make a conscious decision on copyright each time I label a graphic, painting or animation.”</p>
<p>The Creative Commons licences, Vicky says, “protect me as well as the creator. Without a licence, it’s unclear what kinds of sharing and reuse the creator would be comfortable with. It can also be hard to find the owner of the artwork, if you want to legally reuse it.”</p>
<p>Vicky is currently licensing her work using a ‘No Derivatives’ licence. “I might be interested in remix for some of my work. At the moment, though, the ‘No Derivatives’ licence gives me the option to retain control over the work. I think Share-Alike is fantastic if you want to go down the path of promoting yourself. It gives you a wider audience by making it easier for people to share and reuse your work.”</p>
<p>Vicky looks forward to releasing more work under Creative Commons licensing in the future. She is currently working on a website where users can download free graphics and wallpapers. She is planning to release themes for a small fee, also using Creative Commons licensing. She is considering Creative Commons licensing for her other projects, including a compilation of a web-comic and a series of Vlogs.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In this public lecture, <a href="http://www.law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/lee/" target="_blank">Professor Peter Lee</a> from UC Davis will discuss ways to enhance access to inventions produced or funded by public institutions, producing what he calls a "technological commons." Hosted by Victoria University of Wellington's Faculty of Law and the Royal Society of New Zealand, the lecture will "challenge the traditional, market-based nature of the patent system."</p>
<p>A graduate of Yale Law, Professor Lee has <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=611323" target="_blank">published extensively on patent law and intellectual property</a>, and is a leading voice on the intersection of science and society and the patent system’s impact on scientific and technological progress.</p>
<p>The lecture will be chaired by <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/about/staff/graeme-austin" target="_blank">Professor Graeme Austin</a>, Victoria University Faculty of Law and member of the CCANZ legal team. It will be introduced by <a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/funds/marsden/about/staff/" target="_blank">Dean Peterson</a>, Manager of Research Funding at the Royal Society of New Zealand.</p>
<p>When: Tuesday, 16 July 2013, 5.45pm - 6.55pm</p>
<p>Where: Royal Society of New Zealand, 11 Turnbull Street, Thorndon, Wellington</p>
