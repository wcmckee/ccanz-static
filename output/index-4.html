<p>You can also view and <strong>download </strong>Creative Commons Kiwi from <a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782" target="_self">Vimeo</a> for sharing and remixing. A huge thanks to <a href="http://internetnz.net.nz/" target="_self">InternetNZ</a> who have supported us to create this resource.</p>
<p>We worked with <a href="http://mohawkmedia.co.nz/" target="_self">Mohawk Media</a> to create a New Zealand remix on the RSAnimate style of visual story-telling. Aside from the licences, the real star of this project is CCKiwi.</p>
<p>We've released him into the wild under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">CC BY licence</a>. Now it's up to you to remix him in ways that help explain Creative Commons to your colleagues, students and online friends.</p>

<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is the proud custodian of a <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">new beta website</a> guide for those using the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework (NZGOAL). We're pleased to have been able to collaborate with Department of Internal Affairs officials and a member of the CCANZ Legal Panel to bring you this resource on all things NZGOAL.</p>
<p><a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/nzgoal/read-nzgoal" target="_self">The framework</a> was approved by cabinet last winter, and has enjoyed much interest from government staff since. It recommends the Creative Commons BY licence as a default licence when releasing government held content and data for reuse.</p>
<p>You can view some <a href="http://opendatastories.org/" target="_self">great NZ success stories</a> where agencies have released material for reuse under the guidance of NZGOAL, resulting in some exciting and innovative mashups of the by the community.</p>
<p>This beta release of the site will be especially useful to those agencies looking to release some material in time for <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_self">Mix and Mash: the great NZ remix and mashup competition</a>, 2011. Last year's competition revealed some great incentives for government to make material available for mashup and reuse. Two examples are winning application entries <a href="http://nzwalksinfo.co.nz/" target="_self">NZ Walks</a> and <a href="http://www.mashblock.co.nz/%20" target="_self">Mashblock</a> which clearly add value to government information and make it useable, understandable, more interesting, relevant and accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Drop in to the new <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">NZGOAL online</a> where you will find the online 'review and release process' tool, key documents, quick guides and answers to some common questions.</p>
<h3>More Information</h3>

<p>This NZGOAL site is being made available as a beta release and is administered by Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand in close consultation with Department of Internal Affairs’ officials and a member of the CCANZ Legal Panel. It is not a government owned and operated site. We know it's not yet 100% WCAG2 compliant but we wanted to get something out there that agencies can start using, particularly given the imminence of the awesome Mix and Mash Competition for 2011!</p>

<p>A new open access publication <a href="http://www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org/" target="_self">The International Journal of Wellbeing</a> dedicated to interdisciplinary studies of wellbeing and happiness has released its inaugural issue under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_self">Creative Commons BY NC ND licence</a>.</p>
<p>New Zealanders Dan Weijers of Victoria University of Wellington's Philosophy Department and Aaron Jarden from the New Zealand Association of Positive Psychology the Open Polytechnic co-founded the international initiative.</p>
<p>The online journal had adopted an interdisciplinary approach to its publication so that researchers and practitioners can learn from other disciplines and promote their research to a wide audience base.</p>
<p>The content is intended to be accessible in three important ways, by remaining free of charge; legally shareable; and of a writing style that policy makers and the public can easily digest.</p>
<p>"The International Journal of Wellbeing breaks down traditional academic and publishing barriers by making the very research that can change the world for the better easily available to those who will benefit most from it" says Mr Weijers. "People really get behind the idea of open access."</p>
<p>The default Creative Commons BY NC ND licence enables people to share the content freely. Contributing authors are given the opportunity to allow their readers further freedoms by selecting more permissive Creative Commons licences.</p>

<h3>Once again they are releasing some dynamic new music under Creative Commons licences and exploring ways of finding common ground by collaborating through art and performance.</h3>

<p><em>The PIYN project involves aspiring artists and performers from Auckland's diverse communities, working with the best of contemporary UK talent, to collaborate, create and celebrate. The programme involves capacity building workshops, online and face to face collaborations and master-classes in creativity. </em></p>
<p>This year the programme was kicked off in May by a visit from cultural icon Rosanna Raymond. Since then, the artistic community have been treated to workshops and presentations by Rosanna, UK artist Kevin Mark Trail, and Helen Baxter from Mohawk Media.<em> </em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://piyn.net/news/online-toolkit-links/" target="_self">Online Creative Toolkit</a> developed by Helen is a useful resource for creative practitioners utilising Internet platforms. It includes a rich arm of resources related to using Creative Commons for your content strategy. The toolkit is available for anyone to access and reuse under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz" target="_self">Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licence</a>.<em> </em></p>
<p>PIYN's impressive <a href="http://piyn.net/news/otherside-of-the-world/" target="_self">Otherside Of The World</a> initiative involves selected young NZ artists and young indie band artists from the Roundhouse’s Take Part programme in Camden. It is a partnership between the British Council NZ, Redbull NZ, Play It Strange NZ, and the Roundhouse Camden London.</p>
<p>Turns are taken by these musicians to build upon each others work using online platforms such as SoundCloud and Skype meeting facilites from May 30th - 7th June.</p>
<p>This collaboration between London and Auckland which defies geographical distance and disparate time-zones and will result in an EP of Creative Commons licensed music. Parts of the EP will be loaded and promoted on <a href="http://www.ccmixter.org/people/britishcouncilnz" target="_self">ccMixter</a>, as well as through the Camden Roundhouse and the Red Bull Studio platform.</p>
<p>More exciting PIYN events <a href="http://piyn.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/PIYN-Calendar-May-July-20111.pdf" target="_self">are scheduled</a> for July. Oliver Wayman from Bottletop and 'Akala' from the Hip-hop Shakespeare Company will run creative workshops in their expert fields, and a documentary about People In Your Neighbourhood 2010 will screen at the end of the month.</p>
<p>To find out more about People in Your Neighborhood visit their site or come along to the Auckland <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/news_and_events/events/creative_commons_meetup" target="_self">Creative Commons Meetup</a> this June where programme leader Gareth Farry will share more about the project and the talented people involved.</p>

<p>The New Zealand Government’s need for imagery, film footage and data after the recent Christchurch earthquake to help in the various relief efforts and the need for it to be freely available for re-use by individuals and organisations alike has brought the utility of the <a href="http://e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework</a> (NZGOAL) and Creative Commons licensing into sharp focus. In <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/news_and_events/news/post_quake_imagery_of_christchurch_carries_cc_licence">Post-quake imagery of Christchurch carries CC licence</a>, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has published a timely piece which showcases some of the initiatives across government to apply NZGOAL and license material for re-use using open Creative Commons licences.</p>
<p>Those assisting with some of the government initiatives referred to in the Creative Commons post have learned a couple of things from the experience. On the one hand, some agencies and officials within agencies are well aware of NZGOAL and are both willing and able to apply it to enable the legal re-use of government owned copyright material. On the other hand, other agencies and officials have limited awareness of it. That is no criticism. It’s simply a statement of fact.</p>
<p>What was most illuminating, in one case involving film footage of the post-earthquake CBD, was that a request to assist with licensing of certain material assumed (understandably) that there might be legal documents to draft and sign as a prerequisite to releasing the material for re-use. The official concerned wasn’t familiar with the detail of NZGOAL but, once explained, he was was most interested. He was after a quick and efficient solution to enable the licensing of valuable material, with the express purpose of enabling others to re-use it in a hassle-free way, and was pleased to learn that we could rapidly apply a Creative Commons Attribution licence to it and without requiring prospective users of the material to sign a single document. Using NZGOAL’s review and release process, we were able to undertake the requisite legal analysis quickly and provide him with rapid turn-around of the copyright and licensing statements he needed to apply to the material. From start to finish, the whole process took little more than an hour. Shortly thereafter we saw the material springing up on multiple websites around the country.</p>
<p>The purpose of this story, then, is that it shows that open data – in this case open licensing of film footage – was helpful for both the agency concerned and those who wished to re-use the film footage for their own purposes (whether they were the media or otherwise). Can we put a monetary figure on this particular example of open data and open licensing? Not really, no. Was it in the public interest in the wake of a major disaster to make this film footage freely available? It certainly was.</p>

<p>The New Zealand Government’s need for imagery, film footage and data after the recent Christchurch earthquake to help in the various relief efforts and the need for it to be freely available for re-use by individuals and organisations alike has brought the utility of the <a href="http://e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework</a> (NZGOAL) and Creative Commons licensing into sharp focus. In <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/news_and_events/news/post_quake_imagery_of_christchurch_carries_cc_licence">Post-quake imagery of Christchurch carries CC licence</a>, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has published a timely piece which showcases some of the initiatives across government to apply NZGOAL and license material for re-use using open Creative Commons licences.</p>
<p>Those assisting with some of the government initiatives referred to in the Creative Commons post have learned a couple of things from the experience. On the one hand, some agencies and officials within agencies are well aware of NZGOAL and are both willing and able to apply it to enable the legal re-use of government owned copyright material. On the other hand, other agencies and officials have limited awareness of it. That is no criticism. It’s simply a statement of fact.</p>
<p>What was most illuminating, in one case involving film footage of the post-earthquake CBD, was that a request to assist with licensing of certain material assumed (understandably) that there might be legal documents to draft and sign as a prerequisite to releasing the material for re-use. The official concerned wasn’t familiar with the detail of NZGOAL but, once explained, he was was most interested. He was after a quick and efficient solution to enable the licensing of valuable material, with the express purpose of enabling others to re-use it in a hassle-free way, and was pleased to learn that we could rapidly apply a Creative Commons Attribution licence to it and without requiring prospective users of the material to sign a single document. Using NZGOAL’s review and release process, we were able to undertake the requisite legal analysis quickly and provide him with rapid turn-around of the copyright and licensing statements he needed to apply to the material. From start to finish, the whole process took little more than an hour. Shortly thereafter we saw the material springing up on multiple websites around the country.</p>
<p>The purpose of this story, then, is that it shows that open data – in this case open licensing of film footage – was helpful for both the agency concerned and those who wished to re-use the film footage for their own purposes (whether they were the media or otherwise). Can we put a monetary figure on this particular example of open data and open licensing? Not really, no. Was it in the public interest in the wake of a major disaster to make this film footage freely available? It certainly was.</p>

<h3>36 monthly albums &amp; more new music under Creative Commons</h3>

<p>In the world of music, Creative Commons licenses continue to be used by upcoming and established musicians for everything from remix contests to album-a-month projects. And since CC-licensed music <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/creativecommons/status/65042101762662400" target="_self">may be blaring from outerspace</a> for the first time in history on NASA’s Endeavour mission, we thought it would be a good time to do a round-up of the recent developments in Creative Commons music land.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Music Monthly</strong></p>
<p>Two years ago, L.A.-based musician John Wood and CC-friendly record label vosotros <a href="https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/13077" target="_self">launched</a> Learning Music Monthly, an album-a-month musical series. Every month, John Wood wrote, recorded, mixed, and mastered an album—and made each album available as part of a tiered subscription service that ranged from a donation-based digital option (available for download under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY-NC-SA license</a>) to a $60 package that included handmade albums delivered to your mailbox, limited edition stickers, bonus albums from friends of LMM, and even personalized birthday songs! These extras inevitably evolved as the project scaled, but the albums kept coming, an impressive feat for John Wood and his friends.</p>
<p>After three seasons and 36 albums, LMM has finally come to an end. In celebration, <a href="http://www.vosotros.com/" target="_self">vosotros</a> has created an excellent 37 song Learning Music compilation entitled, “<em><a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Learning_Music/An_End_Like_This/" target="_self">An End Like This</a></em>,” <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/label/Vosotros/blog/An_End_Like_This" target="_self">blogged</a> over at the Free Music Archive. Additionally, all of the albums are <a href="http://learningmusicmonthly.com/archives/" target="_self">archived</a> for continuous discovery and remix at the LMM site.</p>
<p><strong>R.E.M.</strong></p>
<p>A great example of new, open distribution models, LMM is only one of many musicians and projects encouraging participation and remix under CC licenses. Earlier this year, R.E.M. launched a CC remix contest for “<a href="http://soundcloud.com/groups/iht-remix" target="_self">It Happened Today</a>” on SoundCloud, one of the web’s easiest platforms for sharing your CC-licensed originals and remixes. Stems from the song were released under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY-NC-SA</a>, and remixes were uploaded to SoundCloud under the same license. You can check out all remixed versions of the song <a href="http://soundcloud.com/groups/iht-remix" target="_self">here</a> and read more about what went down at CC Australia’s <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/weblog/entry/2575" target="_self">coverage</a> of the contest.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Simon</strong></p>
<p>Indaba, a hub for musical collaboration online, also continues to work with an expanding and interesting array of musicians for its artists remix contests. A recent contest featured Paul Simon’s latest single “<a href="http://www.indabamusic.com/opportunities/paul-simon" target="_self">Love Is Eternal Sacred Light</a>,” soliciting fan remixes under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY-NC-ND</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nighty Night by 8in8</strong></p>
<p>And the latest treat is <a href="http://music.amandapalmer.net/album/nighty-night" target="_self">Nighty Night by 8in8</a>, an all-star collaboration between Ben Folds, Amanda Palmer, Neil Gaiman, and Damien Kulash from OK Go. The group set out to make eight songs in eight hours, and released the resulting album under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY-NC</a>. You can read Neil’s account of the song-making process at his <a href="http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2011/04/supergroup-madness.html" target="_self">blog</a> and buy the album at Amanda Palmer’s <a href="http://music.amandapalmer.net/album/nighty-night" target="_self">bandcamp page</a>. Initial proceeds will go to <a href="http://berkleecitymusicnetwork.org/" target="_self">berkleecitymusicnetwork.org</a>, a charity dedicated to fulfilling kids’ musical potential.</p>

<p>These high quality aerial images of Christchurch following the devastating February 6.3 magnitude earthquake have <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake/4809621/High-quality-aerial-pictures-of-Christchurch-available" target="_self">been made available</a> on the <a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/3185-christchurch-post-earthquake-aerial-photos-24-feb-2011/" target="_self">Koordinates</a> platform under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>.</p>
<p>The images were produced by <a href="http://www.nzam.com/default.asp" target="_self">New Zealand Aerial Mapping (NZAM)</a> for <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/index.aspx" target="_self">Land Information New Zealand</a>. Their birds-eye-view perspective of the area helped Christchurch Police, Civil Defence, and other emergency services asses damage.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">licence</a> attached to their public release allows anyone to legally copy, share, and adapt the imagery as long as they attribute the source.</p>
<p>The move to make public sector materials available under an open access option such as the Creative Commons Attribution licence is in line with the <a href="http://www.e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal" target="_self">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing (NZGOAL) Framework</a>. This framework provides guidance for agencies when releasing copyright works and non-copyright material for re-use by third parties (the public), and was approved by Cabinet last July.</p>
<p>Those assisting the government to encourage Creative Commons licensing under the NZGOAL framework have noted its utility during the post-quake period where access to information and imagery is hugely important, and agencies are looking for guidance on releasing these materials.</p>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/" target="_self">Civil Defence</a> released some <a href="http://nbr.co.nz/article/video-central-christchurch-two-weeks-after-quake-ck-88665" target="_self">inner city footage</a> for screening at memorial events under a Creative Commons Attribution licence also.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbXJJN9ZSFc]</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/" target="_self">NZ Defence Force</a> are following suit by making their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nzdefenceforce/" target="_self">collections of recent photos</a>, many of Christchurch, Creative Commons Attribution via a Flickr stream.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nzdefenceforce/5469221429/in/set-72157625987305601/"><img class="size-full wp-image-475" title="chchcath" src="http://cc.royalsociety.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/chchcath.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331"></a></p>
<p>The non government project '<a href="http://eq.org.nz/" target="_self">Christchurch Recovery Map</a>' has also taken up the Creative Commons movement surrounding the February events. Its open and crowd-sourced map application of damage and relief reports throughout the city provided an API function and map images available under the Attribution licence.</p>
