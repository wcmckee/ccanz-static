<p>The Ministers of Finance and Internal Affairs have released a <a href="http://business.scoop.co.nz/2011/08/15/open-data-will-benefit-public-economy-english/" target="_self">statement</a> today detailing a new Declaration on Open and Transparent Government.</p>
<p><em>“Today the Government is releasing a declaration that clearly sets out our expectation that agencies should release all non-personal and unclassified data with high potential value for re-use,” </em>says Finance Minister Bill English<em>.</em></p>
<p>Included in the full <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/declaration-open-and-transparent-government" target="_self">Declaration on Open and Transparent Government statement</a>, is the notion that "The government holds data on behalf of the New Zealand public. We release it to enable the private and community sectors to use it to grow the economy, strengthen our social and cultural fabric, and sustain our environment. We release it to encourage business and community involvement in government decision-making."</p>
<p>The utility of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences_explained__1" target="_self">New Zealand Creative Commons licences</a> for legally reusable materials is detailed in the <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework (NZGOAL)</a>. The framework acts as guidance for agencies when opening up content and data for reuse. In particular, the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_self">Attribution licence</a> is recommended as the default licence when releasing material in this way.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/new-zealand-data-and-information-management-princi" target="_self">New Zealand Data and Information Management Principles</a> have also been approved to ensure high quality management of the information the government holds on the behalf of the public.</p>
<p>One such Principal is that materials should be 'Reusable':</p>
<p><em>Data and information released can be discovered, shared, used and reused over time and through technology change. Copyright works are licensed for reuse and open access to and reuse of non-copyright materials is enabled, in accordance with the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework.</em></p>
<p><em>Data and information are released:</em></p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;</span>at source, with the highest possible level of granularity<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;</span>in re-usable, machine-readable format<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;</span>with appropriate metadata; and<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;</span>in aggregate or modified forms if they cannot be released in their original state.<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre>




<p><em>Data and information released in proprietary formats are also released in open, non-proprietary formats.</em></p>
<p><em>Digital rights technologies are not imposed on materials made available for reuse.</em></p>

<p>We worked with <a href="http://mohawkmedia.co.nz/" target="_self">Mohawk Media</a> to create a New Zealand remix on the RSAnimate style of visual story-telling. Aside from the licences, the real star of this project is CCKiwi.</p>
<p>We've released him into the wild under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">CC BY licence</a>. Now it's up to you to remix him in ways that help explain Creative Commons to your colleagues, students and online friends.</p>

<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is the proud custodian of a <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">new beta website</a> guide for those using the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework (NZGOAL). We're pleased to have been able to collaborate with Department of Internal Affairs officials and a member of the CCANZ Legal Panel to bring you this resource on all things NZGOAL.</p>
<p><a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/nzgoal/read-nzgoal" target="_self">The framework</a> was approved by cabinet last winter, and has enjoyed much interest from government staff since. It recommends the Creative Commons BY licence as a default licence when releasing government held content and data for reuse.</p>
<p>You can view some <a href="http://opendatastories.org/" target="_self">great NZ success stories</a> where agencies have released material for reuse under the guidance of NZGOAL, resulting in some exciting and innovative mashups of the by the community.</p>
<p>This beta release of the site will be especially useful to those agencies looking to release some material in time for <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_self">Mix and Mash: the great NZ remix and mashup competition</a>, 2011. Last year's competition revealed some great incentives for government to make material available for mashup and reuse. Two examples are winning application entries <a href="http://nzwalksinfo.co.nz/" target="_self">NZ Walks</a> and <a href="http://www.mashblock.co.nz/%20" target="_self">Mashblock</a> which clearly add value to government information and make it useable, understandable, more interesting, relevant and accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Drop in to the new <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">NZGOAL online</a> where you will find the online 'review and release process' tool, key documents, quick guides and answers to some common questions.</p>
<h3>More Information</h3>

<p>This NZGOAL site is being made available as a beta release and is administered by Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand in close consultation with Department of Internal Affairs’ officials and a member of the CCANZ Legal Panel. It is not a government owned and operated site. We know it's not yet 100% WCAG2 compliant but we wanted to get something out there that agencies can start using, particularly given the imminence of the awesome Mix and Mash Competition for 2011!</p>

<p>A new open access publication <a href="http://www.internationaljournalofwellbeing.org/" target="_self">The International Journal of Wellbeing</a> dedicated to interdisciplinary studies of wellbeing and happiness has released its inaugural issue under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_self">Creative Commons BY NC ND licence</a>.</p>
<p>New Zealanders Dan Weijers of Victoria University of Wellington's Philosophy Department and Aaron Jarden from the New Zealand Association of Positive Psychology the Open Polytechnic co-founded the international initiative.</p>
<p>The online journal had adopted an interdisciplinary approach to its publication so that researchers and practitioners can learn from other disciplines and promote their research to a wide audience base.</p>
<p>The content is intended to be accessible in three important ways, by remaining free of charge; legally shareable; and of a writing style that policy makers and the public can easily digest.</p>
<p>"The International Journal of Wellbeing breaks down traditional academic and publishing barriers by making the very research that can change the world for the better easily available to those who will benefit most from it" says Mr Weijers. "People really get behind the idea of open access."</p>
<p>The default Creative Commons BY NC ND licence enables people to share the content freely. Contributing authors are given the opportunity to allow their readers further freedoms by selecting more permissive Creative Commons licences.</p>

<p><strong>15 - 16 August, InterContinental, Wellington</strong></p>
<p><em>This event is designed to cover significant new developments in IP law and to showcase how to commercialise your IP rights successfully. With presentations from the new Ministry of Science + Innovation, the Department of Internal Affairs and multiple case studies of successful companies, we take a close look at the state of IP in New Zealand ... The conference will also examine the effect digital technology and the internet are having on the way information is delivered and received and how they are opening up new ways of using and allowing others to use content. Update your knowledge of what you can and can’t copy to ensure compliance.</em></p>

<h3>Once again they are releasing some dynamic new music under Creative Commons licences and exploring ways of finding common ground by collaborating through art and performance.</h3>

<p><em>The PIYN project involves aspiring artists and performers from Auckland's diverse communities, working with the best of contemporary UK talent, to collaborate, create and celebrate. The programme involves capacity building workshops, online and face to face collaborations and master-classes in creativity. </em></p>
<p>This year the programme was kicked off in May by a visit from cultural icon Rosanna Raymond. Since then, the artistic community have been treated to workshops and presentations by Rosanna, UK artist Kevin Mark Trail, and Helen Baxter from Mohawk Media.<em> </em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://piyn.net/news/online-toolkit-links/" target="_self">Online Creative Toolkit</a> developed by Helen is a useful resource for creative practitioners utilising Internet platforms. It includes a rich arm of resources related to using Creative Commons for your content strategy. The toolkit is available for anyone to access and reuse under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz" target="_self">Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licence</a>.<em> </em></p>
<p>PIYN's impressive <a href="http://piyn.net/news/otherside-of-the-world/" target="_self">Otherside Of The World</a> initiative involves selected young NZ artists and young indie band artists from the Roundhouse’s Take Part programme in Camden. It is a partnership between the British Council NZ, Redbull NZ, Play It Strange NZ, and the Roundhouse Camden London.</p>
<p>Turns are taken by these musicians to build upon each others work using online platforms such as SoundCloud and Skype meeting facilites from May 30th - 7th June.</p>
<p>This collaboration between London and Auckland which defies geographical distance and disparate time-zones and will result in an EP of Creative Commons licensed music. Parts of the EP will be loaded and promoted on <a href="http://www.ccmixter.org/people/britishcouncilnz" target="_self">ccMixter</a>, as well as through the Camden Roundhouse and the Red Bull Studio platform.</p>
<p>More exciting PIYN events <a href="http://piyn.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/PIYN-Calendar-May-July-20111.pdf" target="_self">are scheduled</a> for July. Oliver Wayman from Bottletop and 'Akala' from the Hip-hop Shakespeare Company will run creative workshops in their expert fields, and a documentary about People In Your Neighbourhood 2010 will screen at the end of the month.</p>
<p>To find out more about People in Your Neighborhood visit their site or come along to the Auckland <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/news_and_events/events/creative_commons_meetup" target="_self">Creative Commons Meetup</a> this June where programme leader Gareth Farry will share more about the project and the talented people involved.</p>

<p><em>This case study is reproduced faithfully from a 2011 post on <a href="http://opendatastories.org/2011/05/the-christchurch-earthquake-nzgoal-and-creative-commons/">Open Data Stories website</a> (CC BY).</em></p>
<p>The New Zealand Government’s need for imagery, film footage and data after the recent Christchurch earthquake to help in the various relief efforts and the need for it to be freely available for re-use by individuals and organisations alike has brought the utility of the <a href="http://e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework</a> (NZGOAL) and Creative Commons licensing into sharp focus. In <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/news_and_events/news/post_quake_imagery_of_christchurch_carries_cc_licence">Post-quake imagery of Christchurch carries CC licence</a>, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has published a timely piece which showcases some of the initiatives across government to apply NZGOAL and license material for re-use using open Creative Commons licences.</p>
<p>Those assisting with some of the government initiatives referred to in the Creative Commons post have learned a couple of things from the experience. On the one hand, some agencies and officials within agencies are well aware of NZGOAL and are both willing and able to apply it to enable the legal re-use of government owned copyright material. On the other hand, other agencies and officials have limited awareness of it. That is no criticism. It’s simply a statement of fact.</p>
<p>What was most illuminating, in one case involving film footage of the post-earthquake CBD, was that a request to assist with licensing of certain material assumed (understandably) that there might be legal documents to draft and sign as a prerequisite to releasing the material for re-use. The official concerned wasn’t familiar with the detail of NZGOAL but, once explained, he was was most interested. He was after a quick and efficient solution to enable the licensing of valuable material, with the express purpose of enabling others to re-use it in a hassle-free way, and was pleased to learn that we could rapidly apply a Creative Commons Attribution licence to it and without requiring prospective users of the material to sign a single document. Using NZGOAL’s review and release process, we were able to undertake the requisite legal analysis quickly and provide him with rapid turn-around of the copyright and licensing statements he needed to apply to the material. From start to finish, the whole process took little more than an hour. Shortly thereafter we saw the material springing up on multiple websites around the country.</p>
<p>The purpose of this story, then, is that it shows that open data – in this case open licensing of film footage – was helpful for both the agency concerned and those who wished to re-use the film footage for their own purposes (whether they were the media or otherwise). Can we put a monetary figure on this particular example of open data and open licensing? Not really, no. Was it in the public interest in the wake of a major disaster to make this film footage freely available? It certainly was.</p>
