<h5>Daniel Strypey Bruce</h5>
<p>[<em>This is a piece from a member the Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ community., and is licensed CC-BY-SA. If you want to write for us, please email matt@creativecommons.org.nz.</em>]</p>
<p>When Land Information New Zealand officials, prompted by the support in NZGOAL for free culture CC licenses, started liberating the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/09/linz-data-service/" target="_blank">publicly-funded map data they hold</a> under CC-BY, they may have anticipated that their data could end up in OpenStreetMap.org (OSM). OSM is the libre licensed, crowdsourced, world mapping project (formerly CC-BY-SA, now Open DataBase License) created as a free-as-in-speech alternative to Google Maps, which licenses copyright map and image data from other companies. What they probably never imagined was their data appearing on community sites like the new NSW government funded <a href="http://www.timebanking.com.au/" target="_blank">TimeBanking platform</a> and in maps powered by Leafet, the free code, mobile-friendly, web map engine which uses OSM as the default source for map data. Such are the unintended benefits that flow from sharing in the commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6030" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg" alt="X" width="546" height="366"></a> Screenshot of <a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/1910-otago-075m-rural-aerial-photos-2004-2011/" target="_blank">Otago 0.75m aerial photography</a> by LINZ. Made available under a Creative Commons Attribution licence</p>
<p>Just as OSM contributed to the development of websites using Leaflet, the cultural commons also has a contribution to make to the development of free code speech recognition software. Douglas Bagnall gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BGLrLXm3c" target="_blank">a great talk</a> about free code speech recognition engines at Kiwi PyCon 2012, and one of the main non-coding challenges he identified is the lack of a suitably large corpus of spoken speech with which to train' the software (the interesting bits for non-coders starts at about 3:00), particularly for less common accents like New Zealand English.</p>
<p>Douglas mentioned a site called VoxForge.org and encouraged us all to record some speech for it. VoxForge collects samples of speech to "compile them into acoustic models for use with Open Source speech recognition engines", with both the acoustic models and the source data are made available under the GNU General Public License, the free code software license used by the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Voxforge is a great resource, but it would be a lot of work to drive enough 'Nu Zylnd' accented speakers there. and it occurred to me recently that there is another source of spoken speech for which there is strong argument for libre licensing; public interest radio. Releasing audio programs made for National Radio, student radio, and community access radio, under a libre license (eg CC-BY), has always seemed like a no-brainer to me. Even before I set up <a href="posts/2014/05/07/cc-nz@groups.creativecommons.org.nz" target="_blank">the CC-NZ email list</a>, I was contacting community radio people and telling them about the potential benefits of podcasting and CC licensing for increasing program exposure, as part of my work with Aotearoa.Indymedia.org.</p>
<p>National Radio are publicly-owned and funded, and currently podcast all their programs in both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats. Student radio stations have also been experimenting with recording their shows and turning them into podcasts, and if they libre licensed the sometimes substantial spoken word parts of recordings like <a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/radio1/" target="_blank">the Radio1 shows shared on MixCloud</a>, they'd be unlikely to miss out on any commercial return.</p>
<p>Community access radio stations, as their name suggests, exist to give special interest groups in our communities access to the airwaves, so their unique voices have a chance to be heard in broadcast media. Access stations are heavily subsidised by public broadcasting funding, and their programs aren't expected to have commercial potential.</p>
<p>Whenever these programs are rebroadcast, both the program producers, and the public who subsidize their production, get more bang for their buck. Over the last decade or so, access radio stations have been building up the infrastructure to digitally record programs, so they can be made available as podcasts, on sites like accessradio.org.</p>
<p>What I notice in all three cases though, is that despite NZGOAL-inspired wave of CC license adoptions across public service organisations from LINZ, to schools and tertiary institutions, to archives and museums, I see no sign of CC licenses on locally made radio so far. I'm guessing one issue is legal confusion and risk aversion.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to CC my radio program, what about the copyright songs I played during the program? Who owns the copyright on ads, and is it acceptable to remove them? Radio stations and rebroadcast sites can pay a fixed fee to collection organisations like NZRIA and APRA for permission to play the songs, but they can't pass on that permission to anyone who rebroadcasts the program.</p>
<p>What can we do to show public radio stations that libre licensing - CC or otherwise - is a good fit for their organizational mission, and help them negotiate the legal minefields around copyright? Between them, the RadioNZ, community access, and students stations have vast numbers of hours of recordings, covering a wide range of kiwi accents spoken regularly on ethnic community radio programs. Having these available under a libre license would have benefits beyond just sharing the information and perspective included in public interest radio programs.</p>
<p>It could also be tremendously helpful to people working on getting free code/ open source speech recognition software to recognise New Zilnd accents, which in turn would be tremendously helpful for any kiwi wanting a speech-operated computer that respects their software freedom. The same would be true for speakers of Te Reo MƒÅori, and other Polynesian languages, who, like NZ English speakers, are also less likely to record enough speech at sites like VoxForge for them to generate a useful acoustic model.</p>
<p>In '<a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html" target="_blank">The Coming Civil War over General Purpose Computing</a>', Cory Doctorow asks us to consider the implications if the proprietary software running on many of our personal computers was instead running on our bionic legs;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">"If I can lo-jack your legs, I can lease them to you with the confidence of my power to repo them if you default on payments. If I can't, I may not lease you legs unless you've got a lot of money to begin with. But if your legs can decide to walk to the repo-depot without your consent, you will be totally screwed the day that muggers, rapists, griefers or the secret police figure out how to hijack that facility."</p>

<p>Like bionic legs, accessibility tools like speech recognition and text-to-speech are augmentations which restore equalit, helping people with conditions from blindness to quadraplegia to have the full use of computers and the internet that most of us take for granted. Such essential tools should not be subject to the price pumping and hidden agendas that go with proprietary sofware.</p>

<p>In the middle of March, we held a series of events on <a title="Creative Commons Policies for Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/03/creative-commons-policies-for-schools/" target="_blank">Creative Commons policies in schools</a> in Christchurch, Auckland and Wellington. The events featured lightning talks from a handful of experts in government, law and education, who outlined the legal, technical and cultural reasons for schools to implement a Creative Commons policy.</p>
<p>While we couldn't manage to record video of the events, we have recorded the audio for the final event in Wellington. Unfortunately, Carolyn Stuart and Mark Osborne weren't able to attend, though Ian Munro was able to speak to Carolyn's slides, and we've included a quick summary of their talks below.</p>

CCANZ works to achieve these goals in two ways. First, it offers free licences. Second, it runs eight different projects, which advocate for licence use is various areas, such as research, data, government and heritage.</p>
<p>Matt then ran through eight different points, which are detailed in the slides. The general point of his talk was that while the internet and digital technologies have made sharing and reuse very easy, copyright law still represents a significant legal barrier. This is particularly true in the case of teaching resources, which remain the property of the Board of Trustees. He finished his talk by suggesting that Creative Commons licensing -- and a Creative Commons policy -- can help to address these IP problems in New Zealand schools, while actively encouraging sharing and collaboration.</p>

The pictures on your phone, the emails to your mother, the embarrassing poems you wrote when you were in year 12 ‚Äì all of these works qualify for copyright protection. Ordinarily, you, as creator, own the copyright to those works.</p>
<p>However, if you create the work in the course of your employment, then the copyright belongs to your employer. This means that the copyright to all teaching resources produced by teachers in the course of their employment as teachers is owned by the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>What if the BoT wanted to share teaching resources with other schools? It could say, 'here, use it.' From a lawyer‚Äôs perspective, though, this is imprecise. There might be a bunch of other things the board hasn't thought about, such as commercial reuse, attribution and liability.</p>
<p>It's better, then, to use a standardised, legally robust licence, such as those provided by Creative Commons. It's more flexible, and provides protection for both you and the user. Andrew then ran through the Creative Commons licences, noting that the New Zealand licences were relatively clear and plain English.</p>
<p>Andrew ended his presentation by outlining New Zealand's limited 'fair dealing' exceptions. These exceptions do not offer hard and fast rules. Instead, the definition of 'fair' depends on the facts of an individual case, including the amount that is used, its impact on the market of a work, and the nature of the use in question.</p>

As she pointed out, the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework supports the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector. NZGOAL provides a 'review and release process' that enables agencies to decide whether a work is suitable for release under an open licence. In the education sector, the Ministry of Education must use NZGOAL to release its copyright materials; schools and universities are encouraged to participate.</p>
<p>But why would they? Keitha argued that a Creative Commons policy is a way for BoTs to require teachers to use and create licensed materials. It's also a way to encourage students to use and create legally licensed materials. More broadly, the adoption of Creative Commons policies will make the education system in New Zealand more efficient and innovative, as teachers spend less time reinventing the wheel and more time sharing, collaborating and building on each other's work.</p>
<p>Schools can do this by passing an open data policy ‚Äì otherwise known as a Creative Commons IP policy ‚Äì encouraging teachers to collaborate and share, rather than compete and duplicate efforts. This policy requires teachers to apply a Creative Commons Attribution licence when sharing resources, and use a 'no known copyright' statement if releasing a work has fallen out of copyright. Keitha finished her presentation by pointing to an open licence used by Te Ara ‚Äì The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand. She also pointed to the vast amount of works available through Flickr and many other repositories searchable through CC search.</p>

On the one hand, some teachers are protective of their resources, or lack confidence in their quality; on the other hand, many teachers are more than happy to share resources with anyone who asks. As new technologies and pedagogies arise, Ian argued that more and more teachers will become interested in sharing and collaboration.</p>
<p>When teachers begin to share resources, however, they have to confront the fact that, under the Copyright Act, their resources are owned by their Board of Trustees. This presents a significant hurdle to the sharing of digital resources, one that is most effectively addressed by adopting a Creative Commons IP policy at every school.</p>
<p>As Ian explained, IP was one of the issues faced by the MoE as it looked to source teaching resources for schools after the February 2011 Canterbury earthquake. Many schools found themselves unable to access their resources, which were either destroyed or stuck in unsafe buildings. In response, the MoE asked many of New Zealand's top performing schools to provide subject area resources.</p>
<p>This was not as easy as it sounds. Some schools, for instance, were keen to ensure that the resources wouldn't be made to other schools. Other schools thought that it was a great opportunity to develop a online repository for teaching resources, and were more than happy to oblige. But even schools that were happy to oblige found that their files had no clear metadata attached, including no standardised naming schema, file organisation or file formats. This made it incredibly difficult for outsiders to find the resources they needed.</p>

The portal is also a great reason for schools to adopt a Creative Commons policy, as it is going to make it much easier to find and share resources. Pond will act as a safe online environment for educators to share and collaborate, but it will require schools to clarify their positions on Intellectual Property, as it will be both the teacher's responsibility to ensure that they have permission to legally share content.

A colleague asked to borrow the resource, and Stephen, in the spirit of collegiality, said yes, at which point the colleague proceeded to sell the resource to a publishing company. Stephen, hoping for royalties, complained to the principal, who pointed out that it was the school that owned the rights to the resource ‚Äì and that it was the school that would be collect any royalty payments.</p>
<p>We are, Stephen said, is an age of connectivity, and we are sharing more than ever. And teachers share as much as anyone, remixing and reusing resources to fit the needs of individual classrooms. New Zealand has also emerged beyond the competitive, contestable funding approach; with the recent development of Learning and Change Networks and collaboration on ICT, schools are increasingly being expected to share best practice with each other.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs important, then, that Boards of Trustees acknowledge that this is an age of sharing and collaboration ‚Äì even when the professional instincts of BoT members, who may come from corporate backgrounds, are to commercialise educational resources produced at the school. This drive towards sharing and collaboration needs to be based in the vision of the school. At Taupaki, this vision was developed by the teachers and local community ‚Äì without input from Stephen himself. This vision was included a desire to encourage collaboration , and this was a core part of Stephen‚Äôs sales pitch to the BoT.</p>
<p>Stephen submitted a discussion document to the BoT, and drew on these parts of their vision, as well as the potential for sharing in the Network for Learning, and it was passed just before Stephen went on study leave. But the implementation will be the challenge, and it is still early days. As Stephen said, quoting Friere, ‚Äúideas that are acquired with ease are discarded with ease.‚Äù</p>

A policy that enabled and encouraged sharing and collaboration was a great fit with the vision of the school.</p>
<p>Quoting David Wiley, Mark argued that sharing and collaboration is fundamental to education: "without sharing, there is no education." However, Mark also pointed out that openness is a new concept for many, including members of the Board of Trustees who may come from a commercial background. This meant that the policy required a shift in mental models. Instead of the 'see-saw' metaphor -- whereby a gain for one is a loss for the other -- Mark advocated a shift to a 'rising tide' metaphor, whereby sharing and collaboration benefits everyone, including those doing the sharing and collaborating.</p>
<p>He then pointed out several concrete examples of sharing communities, including the VLN and Wikieducator, where ASHS has had an active presence for many years. Mark concluded by discussing into other forms of openness, such as open software and open hardware, arguing that schools should be wary of locking their students into closed applications run by off-shore multi-nationals. Instead, schools should explore the range of free and open alternatives.</p>

<h5>BY HANNAH METTNER</h5>
<p>Richard White is an interesting example of an artist using CC to make his own creative output available, while working in a job that clearly demonstrates the pitfalls and possibilities of copyright and open access day in and day out.</p>
<p>Richard has made two of his albums available for download on Bandcamp, <a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">under the name Mermaid Guitar</a>. He began by offering his earlier album, <a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/album/me-for-a-day" target="_blank">‚ÄòMe for a Day‚Äô</a>, with a five dollar price tag, and then decided to offer ‚ÄòBarry Starr‚Äô for free, with the ‚Äúname your price‚Äù function, where users choose how much they‚Äôd like to pay.</p>
<p>Despite being available for free, the second album has had more downloads <i>and</i> more sales -- so he‚Äôs now offering the earlier album under the same terms. For Richard, this makes the process of selling an album more exciting. As he puts it, ‚ÄúPeople have paid a lot more than I thought they might, more than the five dollars I initially offered the first album for."</p>
<p>Plenty of others have downloaded his music for free, but Richard says that he‚Äôs totally happy with this. ‚ÄúUltimately I just like the idea that someone‚Äôs listening to my music on their iPod on the other side of the world‚Äù. But he‚Äôs also careful to point out that he doesn‚Äôt try to make a living from his music and concedes that, for those who do, there are greater challenges.</p>
<p>As part of the production process, Richard sourced all artwork for ‚ÄòBarry Starr‚Äô from Public Domain or CC sources, but he says finding images which could be used with the CC BY SA licence he used for the album, which also fit his purpose, was trickier than he thought.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere were some great images I really liked, but they had either ND or, more commonly, NC," Richard says. "Given that people could pay, I couldn‚Äôt use NC. I guess the difficulty I had finding good stuff showed me that open access is still at the ‚Äòevangelical‚Äô stage in many respects and we need more converts for it to become more self-sustaining‚Äù.</p>
<p>By day, Richard works as Copyright Officer at the University of Otago, addressing any copyright issues or questions encountered by staff and research students there. This can be a challenge: while most staff have an understanding of the broad concepts of copyright, it can be a complex web of legislation, licences and rights.</p>
<p>Richard has found himself a staunch advocate of open access in the tertiary sector and CC as the main vehicle for that. ‚ÄúCC licences simplify a lot of things from a copyright point of view‚Äù, he says. ‚ÄúOften a staff member or a PhD student will come to me or one of our library staff with questions about permission for something they want to use in a piece of research. One of the most common problems is that they just don‚Äôt hear from someone they‚Äôve contacted to get permission‚Äù.</p>
<p>He says a lot of the time accessibility is the last thing researchers and academics are thinking about. They‚Äôre used to things being done a certain way and aren‚Äôt necessarily aware of the open access alternatives. Their reputations as academics are affected by how often they‚Äôre being published in scholarly journals, and the quality of those journals is taken into account too.</p>

<h5><em>By Hannah Mettner</em></h5>
<p>Richard White is an interesting example of an artist using CC to make his own creative output available, while working in a job that clearly demonstrates the pitfalls and possibilities of copyright and open access day in and day out.</p>
<p>Richard has made two of his albums available for download on Bandcamp, <a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">under the name Mermaid Guitar</a>. He began by offering his earlier album, <a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/album/me-for-a-day" target="_blank">‚ÄòMe for a Day‚Äô</a>, with a five dollar price tag, and then decided to offer ‚ÄòBarry Starr‚Äô for free, with the ‚Äúname your price‚Äù function, where users choose how much they‚Äôd like to pay.</p>
<p>Despite being available for free, the second album has had more downloads <i>and</i> more sales -- so he‚Äôs now offering the earlier album under the same terms. For Richard, this makes the process of selling an album more exciting. As he puts it, ‚ÄúPeople have paid a lot more than I thought they might, more than the five dollars I initially offered the first album for."</p>
<p>[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2754915517 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=1]</p>
<p>Plenty of others have downloaded his music for free, but Richard says that he‚Äôs totally happy with this. ‚ÄúUltimately I just like the idea that someone‚Äôs listening to my music on their iPod on the other side of the world‚Äù. But he‚Äôs also careful to point out that he doesn‚Äôt try to make a living from his music and concedes that, for those who do, there are greater challenges.</p>
<p>As part of the production process, Richard sourced all artwork for ‚ÄòBarry Starr‚Äô from Public Domain or CC sources, but he says finding images which could be used with the CC BY SA licence he used for the album, which also fit his purpose, was trickier than he thought.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere were some great images I really liked, but they had either ND or, more commonly, NC," Richard says. "Given that people could pay, I couldn‚Äôt use NC. I guess the difficulty I had finding good stuff showed me that open access is still at the ‚Äòevangelical‚Äô stage in many respects and we need more converts for it to become more self-sustaining‚Äù.</p>
<p>[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2754915517 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=6]</p>
<p>By day, Richard works as Copyright Officer at the University of Otago, addressing any copyright issues or questions encountered by staff and research students there. This can be a challenge: while most staff have an understanding of the broad concepts of copyright, it can be a complex web of legislation, licences and rights.</p>
<p>Richard has found himself a staunch advocate of open access in the tertiary sector and CC as the main vehicle for that. ‚ÄúCC licences simplify a lot of things from a copyright point of view‚Äù, he says. ‚ÄúOften a staff member or a PhD student will come to me or one of our library staff with questions about permission for something they want to use in a piece of research. One of the most common problems is that they just don‚Äôt hear from someone they‚Äôve contacted to get permission‚Äù.</p>
<p>He says a lot of the time accessibility is the last thing researchers and academics are thinking about. They‚Äôre¬† used to things being done a certain way and aren‚Äôt necessarily aware of the open access alternatives. Their reputations as academics are affected by how often they‚Äôre being published in scholarly journals, and the quality of those journals is taken into account too.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the major roadblock for open access publications, just getting enough visibility and usage to attract good quality research, to gain a name as a good journal, not just an open access journal. I mean, I‚Äôd love it if all research was open‚Äù.</p>
<p>[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2765089846 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=4]</p>
<p>Other countries are mandating that all publicly funded research should be open -- the U.S. Government, for example -- but New Zealand isn‚Äôt making any moves yet. Instead academics do their research, write it up, submit it for publication, go through the peer review process, and are accepted into these big journals where they‚Äôre published, which universities around the world then pay subscription fees to access.</p>
<p>He appreciates the freedom Creative Commons licences give both creator and reuser, academic and artistic. ‚ÄúWhen someone has used a CC licence they‚Äôve declared up front what they‚Äôre happy for others to do with their work. So part of my work is helping people understand the implications of their choices with their own work as part of the knowledge ecosystem.</p>
<p>"In that respect it‚Äôs no different from choosing CC in an artistic medium: you‚Äôre sharing your work for others to use and build on. ¬†I can‚Äôt claim that my music has informed great cultural achievements but there are people who‚Äôve put it in compilations or used it in their films, which is immensely satisfying‚Äù.</p>

<p>Over the last week, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been running <a title="Creative Commons Workshops" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schools">free ‚ÄòCC in Schools‚Äô workshops</a> across the country.¬†Later in the week, we‚Äôll post slides, audio and summaries of each of the speakers, as well as the issues raised in the lively Q&amp;As that followed.</p>
<p>With support from <a href="https://internetnz.net.nz/" target="_blank">InternetNZ</a>, these workshops talked about how a growing number of New Zealand schools are using CC licensing to share their teaching resources. Resource sharing, of course, isn‚Äôt new: everyday, teachers share countless resources across a range of vibrant professional networks, from the <a href="http://www.vln.school.nz/" target="_blank">VLN</a> to subject-area email lists. For the most part, though, resource sharing among teachers is necessarily informal. It often takes place in the form of email attachments, without licensing or metadata attached.</p>
<p>This means that other teachers, who may be new to the profession -- or who may simply not be part of that specific conversation or network ‚Äì tend to miss out. They may, as a result, end up having to reinvent that resource later on, which gives them less time for the many, many other things teachers have do.</p>
<p>It would be nice, then, if New Zealand had a central, searchable repository of properly labelled and openly licensed teacher-made resources. (If you‚Äôre not sure we need such a repository, check out the site visits at<a href="http://maths.nayland.school.nz/" target="_blank"> Nayland College's excellent Maths portal</a> (soon to be CC-licensed!) ‚Äì it‚Äôs had over <i>1.28 million</i>).</p>
<p>The good news is that the <a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/portal/" target="_blank">Network for Learning portal</a> looks set to help meet this demand. While the portal is still in beta, it has the capacity to allow teachers to find and reuse free and open resources from the entire New Zealand teaching community. This would mean that teachers, including those new to teaching, could spend less time reinventing the wheel, and more time adapting quality resources for their individual classrooms.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But the barriers to sharing resources are not only technical ‚Äì they‚Äôre legal. Under <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345930.html" target="_blank">section 21 of the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994</a>, where an employee makes copyright works ‚Äúin the course of his or her employment [...] that person's employer is the first owner of any copyright in the work.‚Äù</p>
<p>What to do? The so<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SRR-Legally.png"><img class="wp-image-5229 alignleft" alt="SRR Legally" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SRR-Legally.png" width="249" height="255"></a>lution for many New Zealand schools is a <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank">Creative Commons IP policy</a>, approved by a school‚Äôs BoT. This policy gives teachers permission in advance to share resources under an open Creative Commons licence. This means that teachers can legally make the most of online resource sharing portals, such as the Network for Learning (or <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikieducator</a>).</p>
<p>Such policies are also supported by the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/" target="_blank">New Zealand Government‚Äôs Open Access and Licensing framework</a>, approved by Cabinet in 2010. This framework instructs core agencies ‚Äì like the Ministry of Education ‚Äì to consider using Creative Commons licences when releasing copyright works. Happily, NZGOAL also encourages Boards of Trustees to do the same.</p>
<p>But why use a CC licence? Simply put, an open licence gives others teachers clarity about what they can do with your work and how you wish to be credited. As Andrew Matangi ‚Äì who had a big hand in writing the CC licences -- pointed out in the workshops, the licences are also legally robust, which means that you don‚Äôt need to worry about issues like liability. (Andrew‚Äôs example was a malfunctioning science experiment).</p>
<p>Importantly, the more open CC licenses also allow the creation of ‚Äòderivative‚Äô works ‚Äì that is to say, these licences let you adapt and improve the works. As every teacher knows, this is crucial, as even the best resources need to be tweaked or remixed for the unique challenges of individual classrooms. Simply put, digital technologies make remix easy; CC licences make remix legal.</p>
<p>This sounds quite legalistic, but the primary effects of a CC policy ‚Äì as Stephen Lethbridge and Mark Osborne both pointed out ‚Äì are <i>cultural</i>. Stephen and Mark‚Äôs CC policies were passed to support their schools‚Äô desire to be collaborative, open and networked places, where teachers and students share, make and innovate.</p>

<p>Next week, a range of teachers, principals, government officials and copyright experts are getting together to discuss how New Zealand teachers can legally share and reuse teaching resources.</p>
<p>Speakers include Andrew Matangi from Buddle Findlay, Stephen Lethbridge, principal of Taupaki School and Carolyn Stuart, Education Sector Lead for the Network for Learning.</p>
<p>Taking place in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, the events follow the rapid uptake of Creative Commons licensing policies by New Zealand schools. These policies make it legal for teachers to share their resources without asking advance permission from the school.</p>
<p>As Matt McGregor, Public Lead of Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ, points out, more than forty New Zealand schools have now adopted Creative Commons policies, up from four in March 2013. These schools include Tawa Intermediate, Albany Senior High School and Taupaki School.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNew Zealand has over 50,000 teachers working in over 2,500 schools,‚Äù says McGregor. ‚ÄúIf teachers were encouraged to legally share and collaborate ‚Äì rather than reinvent the wheel ‚Äì the savings of time and money across the education sector are potentially enormous.‚Äù</p>
<p>Stephen Lethbridge, Principal of Taupaki School, points out that it‚Äôs in the nature of teachers to share.</p>
<p>Taupaki School passed its Creative Commons policy after noticing that, as <a href="http://stephenlethbridge.com/?p=135" target="_blank">Lethbridge puts it</a>, ‚Äúteachers were sharing more on more resources online and connecting with a great many schools who were visiting us. It would have been a nightmare to seek permission from the board, more likely the school principal, every time a teacher or student wanted to share information.‚Äù</p>
<p>Mark Osborne, former Deputy Principal of Albany Senior High School, <a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/" target="_blank">points out</a> that the use of Creative Commons has had broader cultural effects at the school.</p>
<p>As he said in 2012, ‚ÄúThe big change taking place is that teachers are collaborating more, and they‚Äôre also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources. This is quite different from what happens in most schools.‚Äù</p>
<p>Creative Commons policies have been supported by the New Zealand Government‚Äôs Open Access and Licensing framework, or NZGOAL, approved by Cabinet in 2010. This framework outlines massive cultural, economic and educational benefits of sharing publicly funded copyright materials.</p>

<p>MEDIA RELEASE 13 February 2014</p>
<p>The Media Text Hack Group is proud to release v1 of the hacked Media Studies Textbook, following a highly successful remote collaboration with participants from across New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>The project was spearheaded by Dr Erika Pearson, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Media, Film and Communication¬† University of Otago. As Pearson explains, ‚Äúthe textbook is designed to be used by students in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific. To this end, the textbook includes nearly fifty entries on a range of topics and issues common to curricula across the region.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve also released the text book under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. This means that educators and students can adapt and rewrite the textbook using their own examples and explanations, without having to ask our permission in advance.‚Äù</p>
<p>Inspired by similar projects around the world, and supported by funding from Creative Commons, the Media Text Hack Group sought to act as ‚Äòcurators‚Äô of the vast array of information about media and communication, and drew together examples specific to the region.</p>
<p>The text can be read linearly, like a book, and the online format also means that readers can also dive in and out of sections as they wish, following hypertext links across the material and out to useful information across the web.</p>
<p>As Richard White, Copyright Officer at the University of Otago, puts it, "This is a real 21st century textbook - I hesitate to even use that word - that harnesses the power of the web to break out of the print model we've had for the last several hundred years.¬† It's open access, which means a lot of different things: it's free; anyone can read it, use it, adapt it; it's also open to wider scrutiny, which helps improve it over time."</p>
<p>This first release represents a core of work based on the common curricula of media and communication studies programs across the region.¬† It is hoped that future versions will develop and expand these areas, as well as take advantage of new tools of collaboration and sharing.¬† All are welcome to take, use, recycle and adapt the material under the Creative Commons Attribution licence.</p>
<p>"It's great to see an initiative like this coming out of the Humanities, where most similar examples have been in Science disciplines,‚Äù says White.</p>
<p>"Erika's team have really achieved something wonderful here.¬† As far as we know this is the first initiative of its kind in NZ, and in this discipline, perhaps even the world.‚Äù</p>
<p>This release will soon be followed by a ‚Äòcookbook‚Äô which will discuss the process of developing the book.</p>
<p>As Pearson puts it, ‚Äúthis cookbook will hopefully guide and inspire others to produce their own open educational resources.¬† Open textbooks ensure that educational resources are accessible, affordable and reusable, helping communities to realise the goal of enabling universal access to education.‚Äù</p>

With the launch of its sister site, Audio Culture, in 2013, we thought we'd take the opportunity to revisit both projects. Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ intern Hannah Mettner sat down with NZ On Screen Project Director Clarion Coughlan.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/" target="_blank">NZ On Screen</a> has provided online access to a wealth of New Zealand film, television and music video since 2008. From the outset they‚Äôve used a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial</a> licence for all the work they put into the site. While the video content belongs to the rightsholders, all the synopses, backgrounds and biographies relating to videos and people is licensed under CC. And this material is impressive in its scope and quality; the introductions to the collections, particularly, are personable as well as thorough.</p>
<p>Clarion, the Project Director, talks about how they want to make the content <i>work</i>; their aim is not to put everything they possibly can online, but rather to choose culturally significant pieces and give them space to talk to each other.</p>
<p>NZ On Screen is a curated website, carefully chosen and added to, and the context provided by the written material is crucial. Clarion says ‚Äúrather than just publishing videos, we contextualise them through our writing. As NZ On Screen has been paid for by tax payers (via NZ On Air funding), it makes sense to make that writing available under Creative Commons: To give something back‚Äù.</p>
<p>Having that CC licensed work reused also serves as a useful advertising tool; when writers reuse their pieces on blogs or have them published elsewhere, and actors‚Äô agencies reuse what is effectively a pre-written biography, the CC licence brings people back to the NZ On Screen website.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the popularity of NZ On Screen, May 2013 saw the launch of a sister project, <a href="http://www.audioculture.co.nz/" target="_blank">Audio Culture</a> ‚Äì the ‚Äònoisy library of New Zealand music‚Äô. The site aims to address the ‚Äòdigital silence‚Äô that has surrounded New Zealand music online, and to collect together the stories, multimedia and ephemera that have contributed to NZ music from the last 100 years.</p>
<p>AudioCulture kicked off with 250 pages of people, labels and scenes, all under searchable indexes, plus music, interviews and photographs, with another 300 pages following in the second year. It was certainly very well-received, gaining 25,000 page views in its first month live.</p>
<p>Following the successful formula employed over at NZ On Screen, the music on the site is licensed by PPNZ Music Licensing and APRA/AMCOS and the images have been cleared with copyright owners, but the written content in Profiles, Stories, Labels and Scenes all falls under the CC-BY-NC licence. Like the written content on NZ On Screen, these pieces are not brief introductions; they are well-researched and in-depth, written by a wide variety of contributors, often with a personal connection to the subject, providing an extraordinary depth of context.</p>

<p>Having that CC licensed work reused also serves as a useful advertising tool; when writers reuse their pieces on blogs or have them published elsewhere, and actors‚Äô agencies reuse what is effectively a pre-written biography, the CC licence brings people back to the NZ On Screen website.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the popularity of NZ On Screen, May 2013 saw the launch of a sister project, <a href="http://www.audioculture.co.nz/" target="_blank">Audio Culture</a> ‚Äì the ‚Äònoisy library of New Zealand music‚Äô. The site aims to address the ‚Äòdigital silence‚Äô that has surrounded New Zealand music online, and to collect together the stories, multimedia and ephemera that have contributed to NZ music from the last 100 years.</p>
<p>AudioCulture kicked off with 250 pages of people, labels and scenes, all under searchable indexes, plus music, interviews and photographs, with another 300 pages following in the second year. It was certainly very well-received, gaining 25,000 page views in its first month live.</p>
<p>Following the successful formula employed over at NZ On Screen, the music on the site is licensed by PPNZ Music Licensing and APRA/AMCOS and the images have been cleared with copyright owners, but the written content in Profiles, Stories, Labels and Scenes all falls under the CC-BY-NC licence. Like the written content on NZ On Screen, these pieces are not brief introductions; they are well-researched and in-depth, written by a wide variety of contributors, often with a personal connection to the subject, providing an extraordinary depth of context.</p>

<h5>By Conal Thompson</h5>
<p>It is a common misconception that copyright in a work needs to be registered in order to be recognised. The truth is that in New Zealand copyright exists as soon as a work is created, and whether or not copyright does exist in a work is determined by a set of rules established by the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345634.html" target="_blank">Copyright Act 1994.</a></p>
<p>The distinct lack of formalities required by copyright law has increasingly become an issue with the rise (to use a favourite term of journalists and academics) of the ‚Äúscary internet machine-monster‚Äù (okay, I made that one up).</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Monster-Soup.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5147 " alt="V0011218 An woman dropping her tea-cup in horror u" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Monster-Soup.jpg" width="321" height="218"></a> Not a scary internet machine-monster, but close enough. "<a href="http://www.wellcomecollection.org/explore/sickness--health/topics/epidemics/images.aspx?view=a-monster-soup" target="_blank">Monster Soup commonly called Thames Water</a>" by William Heath, London, 1828, via Wellcome Library / Wellcome Images. Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales License .</p>
<p>What's the issue? Take, for instance, a picture that I draw of the ‚Äúscary internet machine-monster‚Äù that I then publish online. From the second that I publish it, copyright exists in that drawing, which is owned by me.</p>
<p>This is regardless of whether or not I put my name to it, place a little ¬©-symbol next to it, or provide any details that can easily trace the drawing back to its creator (me).</p>
<p>Let's say I chose not to do any of those things when I published it. This is what many people do (or to put it better, don‚Äôt do) when they publish their work online. Such a work is known as an ‚Äúorphan work‚Äù ‚Äì meaning the owner of copyright is difficult to find or untraceable.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that if my picture became really popular and other people wanted to use it, the lack of information I provide with the picture makes it difficult for those people to contact me and gain my permission to use it.</p>
<p>This won‚Äôt prevent the spread of the picture onto other websites that make no money from it ‚Äì but what if a big-shot clothing manufacturer decided they wanted to pay me to put my drawing onto t-shirts that they sell? Unfortunately for me, that lucrative deal won‚Äôt be making its way into my bank account, because I didn‚Äôt provide details of who owns the copyright, and the spread of the picture onto a multitude of other websites would have made it virtually impossible for the manufacturer to track down its origin.</p>
<p>If I applied a Creative Commons license to it, however, then it would make it a lot easier for other users to trace its ownership back to me. Say that I wanted my drawing to be able to be shared and easily attributable back to me ‚Äì I would add a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC licence </a>to it, so that others could use it but not make any money from it.</p>
<p>This means I still have the exclusive right to commercially benefit from it, meaning that big-shot clothing manufacturer can still come knocking at my door and I can still earn reward for my work ‚Äì most of all because this time around, they know where to find me.</p>
<p>Note: In 2013, the Berkeley School of Law hosted a symposium on this very issue, called ‚Äú<a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/formalities.htm" target="_blank">Reform(aliz)ing Copyright for the Internet Age</a>‚Äù. If you‚Äôre interested in the legal and political debate surrounding the establishment of formalities for copyright law then head over there and take a look.</p>
