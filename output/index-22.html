<p>Wednesday 9 July, 2014</p>
<p>5.15 to 6.30pm</p>
<p>Sky City, Auckland.</p>
<p>Room TBD</p>
<p>Free</p>
<p>Over the last four years, New Zealand’s culture and knowledge has become indisputably more open. Schools, universities, libraries, public agencies and artists from across the country are now releasing their work into the commons, for everyone to share and reuse.</p>
<p>The commons in New Zealand is growing. But what does this mean for the next generation of artists, writers, researchers and educators? What are their views on copyright, sharing and reuse? And what can we look forward to in the years ahead?</p>
<p>Join us for a wide-ranging, open conversation on the future of the commons in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss how kiwi culture and knowledge -- including textbooks, literature, music and research -- is being released for everyone, free of charge, and free of all legal and technical restrictions.</p>
<p>Featuring a panel discussion with special guests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager at <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a> and author of CC-licensed novel <a href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz/p/ad-lib-by-thomasin-sleigh.html" target="_blank"><em>Ad Lib</em></a>, who will talk about open arts and culture.</li>

<br><li>Saiya <span class="gI">Guo, BA/LLB (Hons) student at the University of Auckland and Editor-in-Chief of Debris Journal, who will talk about copyright.

</span>
</li>

<br><li>Cameron McLean, PhD Candidate at the University of Auckland andOpen Science advocate, who will talk about open research.</li>

<br><li>Erika Pearson, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Media, Film, and Communication at the University of Otago and co-author of <em>Media Studies 101 - A Creative Commons Textbook</em>, who will talk about open textbooks.</li>

</ul>
<p>This meetup will take place after the <a href="http://nethui.org.nz/">Nethui conference proceedings</a> on Wednesday 9 July. You don't need to attend the Nethui conference to attend this meetup, though it is encouraged!</p>

<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><b><i>What is Creative Commons?</i></b></span></h4>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) is the kaitiaki of the Creative Commons (CC) licences in Aotearoa New Zealand. We provide free legal tools that help people release their works for others to share and reuse, in order to grow the commons, that store of works freely available to access and reuse. Learn more at <a title="Home" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/">creativecommons.org.nz</a>.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><b><i>Creative Commons Licences and Māori Works</i></b></span></h4>

<p>The CC licences are not always considered appropriate for Māori cultural works. CC licences cannot be applied to works that no longer qualify for copyright protection, which is likely to be true of many older Māori works. Also, the licences do not provide protections against culturally offensive or otherwise inappropriate uses of Māori works.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><b><i>A Free Legal Notice for Māori Works</i></b></span></h4>

<p>For these reasons, CCANZ is looking to produce a free legal notice that Māori can use to release cultural works more openly. The notice will be a clear and standard expression of the freedoms and restrictions that cultural producers or kaitiaki of Māori cultural works wish to apply. While the notice cannot grant additional legal protections, it will aim to educate the public about the status of Māori works, while at the same time allowing for greater access, sharing and reuse.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><em><strong>Why a 'Notice' and not a 'Licence'?</strong></em></span></h4>

<p>A 'licence' is based on rights that are legally recognised, and full legal recognition of rights to mātauranga Māori and taonga works does not yet exist. A 'notice' will help to ensure that members of the public are aware of the status of a particular work, and also know how to share and reuse it appropriately.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><b><i>How Will It Work?

</i></b></span></h4>

<p>While the details are yet to be determined, it is likely that a statement and symbol would be attached to a work. These would, in turn, link to a standard, legally robust statement of the freedoms and restrictions that the work's kaitiaki wish to apply.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><b><i>More Information</i></b></span></h4>

<p>Minutes from earlier meetings and our general overview of the issues involved can be found at <a title="Indigenous Knowledge" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/indigenous-knowledge/">our Indigenous Knowledge page</a>.</p>
<h4><b><i><span style="color:#800000;">What Next?</span> </i></b></h4>

<p>We want to know more about what this notice should look like. We are looking for all kinds of feedback, formal and informal, from everyone. We’d love to hear from you. Either get in touch using one of the  channels below, or fill out the Google form. All responses will be confidential.</p>

<h5>BY MATT MCGREGOR</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.taupaki.school.nz/Site/Our_School_2.ashx">Taupaki School</a> is a co-educational primary school, located an hour north-west of Auckland. On 20 February 2013, Taupaki School’s Board of Trustees passed a Creative Commons policy, giving permission to Taupaki’s teachers to share and collaborate, legally.</p>
<p>Paula Hogg has been the chair of the Taupaki BoT since 2012, and oversaw the passage of the Creative Commons policy. As Paula explains, the idea for the policy was initially introduced by the school’s principal, Stephen Lethbridge. While the BoT didn’t have any specific expertise on copyright or intellectual property, Stephen ensured that they had all the necessary information.</p>
<p>“We got a great letter from Stephen outlining all the issues, and following that we put it on the agenda for the next meeting. Stephen provided a lot of information for us to read prior to that meeting, so we felt quite well prepared.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, copyright and intellectual property were new issues for the BoT. As Paula says, “Creative Commons was something we’d never heard of -- it wasn’t even on the periphery. While we were aware of copyright laws, we were not as well informed around exactly what was Board and teacher owned.”</p>
<p>According to New Zealand’s <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/57.0/whole.html#DLM345930">1994 Copyright Act</a>, employers hold first ownership of copyright works produced in the course of employment. <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/Copyright-in-Schools/Guidelines-for-schools/For-teachers-and-contractors/Overview-of-copyright-issues#who">As is stated in TKI</a>, the Ministry of Education’s information portal, this means that, “Unless agreed otherwise, the school will own the copyright in any teaching materials that teachers (employees) create during the course of their employment.”</p>
<p>Simply put, this means that teachers who share resources may often be infringing the school's copyright. Creative Commons policies solve this problem by enabling the school to give advance permission to all teachers to legally share and collaborate using an open Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>Stephen Lethbridge introduced the idea of the policy after noticing that, as he put it in a <a href="http://stephenlethbridge.com/?p=135">blog post</a>, that “teachers were sharing more on more resources online and connecting with a great many schools who were visiting us. It would have been a nightmare to seek permission from the board, more likely the school principal, every time a teacher or student wanted to share information.”</p>
<p>As Paula points out, the policy is also strongly aligned with the school’s existing vision. “Our school’s vision strongly encourages collaboration, and we encourage sharing, so it was a bit of a shock to learn that we needed to have a policy for teachers to share legally.”</p>
<p>“The Creative Commons policy was very aligned with our thinking as a board. There was no dissonance in our discussion. The main issue was that everyone was surprised to discover that this isn’t normal practice.”</p>
<p>According to Paula, the CC policy passed because it supported the fundamental mission of the school -- improving student outcomes. “We knew from the documentation Stephen provided, and from other background reading, that professional development is actually one of the best ways to lift student outcomes. And a big part of professional development is sharing best practice, including resources”</p>
<p>Paula also points out the importance of BoTs aligning their school with existing government policy. While the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/nzgoal" target="_blank">New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework</a> encourages schools to use CC to release copyright works, relatively few schools are aware that the policy exists.</p>
<p>Given the number of policy and procedural issues confronting schools, it’s also unlikely that BoTs will seek out additional policy changes that aren’t brought to their attention.</p>
<p>“It’s important that Boards don’t just view this as a legal obligation and stop there. It does encompass a lot more than that, and it’s important that Boards are aware of that.”</p>
<p>As Stephen points out, “With the <a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/portal/">Network for Learning Portal</a> just around the corner school leaders need to revisit their intellectual property documentation. Creative Commons in Schools isn’t about abdicating responsibility and a copy anything approach. It is about acknowledgement, respect and attribution where the license is determined by the creators of amazing information, resources and ideas within our schools.”</p>

<p>According to Paula, the CC policy passed because it supported the fundamental mission of the school -- improving student outcomes. “We knew from the documentation Stephen provided, and from other background reading, that professional development is actually one of the best ways to lift student outcomes. And a big part of professional development is sharing best practice, including resources”</p>
<p>Paula also points out the importance of BoTs aligning their school with existing government policy. While the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/nzgoal" target="_blank">New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework</a> encourages schools to use CC to release copyright works, relatively few schools are aware that the policy exists.</p>
<p>Given the number of policy and procedural issues confronting schools, it’s also unlikely that BoTs will seek out additional policy changes that aren’t brought to their attention.</p>
<p>“It’s important that Boards don’t just view this as a legal obligation and stop there. It does encompass a lot more than that, and it’s important that Boards are aware of that.”</p>
<p>As Stephen points out, “With the <a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/portal/">Network for Learning Portal</a> just around the corner school leaders need to revisit their intellectual property documentation. Creative Commons in Schools isn’t about abdicating responsibility and a copy anything approach. It is about acknowledgement, respect and attribution where the license is determined by the creators of amazing information, resources and ideas within our schools.”</p>

<p>by Herbert Green, 1919. New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. No known copyright restrictions. (O.009829)In November last year, a team of academics, librarians and students got together to hack a media studies textbook – in a weekend.</p>
<p>The textbook was <a href="http://mediatexthack.wordpress.com/about/">published online earlier this year</a> as an open textbook under a Creative Commons Attribution licence, and is available at no cost for educators and students to use. The licence also enables anyone to share, adapt and rewrite the textbook, as long as credit is given to the original creators.</p>
<p>Achieving this over a weekend was obviously an extraordinarily ambitious project – and like any extraordinarily ambitious project, it didn’t always go according to plan.</p>
<p>Happily, the project team, led by Erika Pearson, Bernard Madill, Richard White and Simon Hart at the University of Otago, decided from the beginning to assiduously document the process of hacking the textbook.</p>
<p>The team have now published the Cookbook, a “discussion on the process, pitfalls and successes of hacking an open textbook.”</p>
<p>The Cookbook walks readers through the texthack process, and outlines some of the issues that the team faced, including finding local open materials to embed and locating appropriate infrastructure.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, the Cookbook’s authors conclude that the “curation of this text, and the hack process that drove it, was deeply worthwhile and a highly valuable experience that led to a useful and important output for both those who wrote it and the students and classes that continue to use it.”</p>
<p>The Cookbook itself has the potential to help open textbook projects around the world.</p>
<p>White says “this cookbook will hopefully guide and inspire others to produce their own open educational resources. Just like the textbook we’ve released the cookbook under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. This means that others can add to and improve the recipe using their own experiences with text hacks, without having to ask our permission in advance.”</p>
<p>He sees the project as a return to the “core principles of academia: sharing knowledge, learning from and building on the work of others.”</p>
<p>As White points out, “From my perspective, as a project organiser rather than someone working in the academic discipline, the cookbook represents the most important aspect of the whole project.  While others will be working in different contexts, hopefully everyone who reads the cookbook will find valuable lessons about what worked and what didn’t for us.”</p>
<p>White adds that the team have “already had interest from others who are thinking about what they could do in their own areas, both inside our own university and other national groups.”</p>
<p>The site itself has received thousands of hits from dozens of countries, and feedback had been received requesting the adoption of sections in both secondary and tertiary programs.</p>
<p>The Cookbook is available online <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/texthack/2014/05/15/the-cookbook/">here</a>. If you want a short introduction to the process of hacking an open textbook, Erika has kindly provided her hugely popular <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/texthack/2014/05/15/a-recap-of-a-texthack-in-gifs-because-why-not/">GIF-heavy recap</a>.</p>

<h5>DANIEL STRYPEY BRUCE</h5>
<p>When Land Information New Zealand officials, prompted by the support in NZGOAL for free culture CC licenses, started liberating the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/09/linz-data-service/" target="_blank">publicly-funded map data they hold</a> under CC-BY, they may have anticipated that their data could end up in OpenStreetMap.org (OSM). OSM is the libre licensed, crowdsourced, world mapping project (formerly CC-BY-SA, now Open DataBase License) created as a free-as-in-speech alternative to Google Maps, which licenses copyright map and image data from other companies. What they probably never imagined was their data appearing on community sites like the new NSW government funded <a href="http://www.timebanking.com.au/" target="_blank">TimeBanking platform</a> and in maps powered by Leafet, the free code, mobile-friendly, web map engine which uses OSM as the default source for map data. Such are the unintended benefits that flow from sharing in the commons.</p>
<p>Just as OSM contributed to the development of websites using Leaflet, the cultural commons also has a contribution to make to the development of free code speech recognition software. Douglas Bagnall gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BGLrLXm3c" target="_blank">a great talk</a> about free code speech recognition engines at Kiwi PyCon 2012, and one of the main non-coding challenges he identified is the lack of a suitably large corpus of spoken speech with which to train' the software (the interesting bits for non-coders starts at about 3:00), particularly for less common accents like New Zealand English.</p>
<p>Douglas mentioned a site called VoxForge.org and encouraged us all to record some speech for it. VoxForge collects samples of speech to "compile them into acoustic models for use with Open Source speech recognition engines", with both the acoustic models and the source data are made available under the GNU General Public License, the free code software license used by the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Voxforge is a great resource, but it would be a lot of work to drive enough 'Nu Zylnd' accented speakers there. and it occurred to me recently that there is another source of spoken speech for which there is strong argument for libre licensing; public interest radio. Releasing audio programs made for National Radio, student radio, and community access radio, under a libre license (eg CC-BY), has always seemed like a no-brainer to me. Even before I set up <a href="posts/cc-nz@groups.creativecommons.org.nz" target="_blank">the CC-NZ email list</a>, I was contacting community radio people and telling them about the potential benefits of podcasting and CC licensing for increasing program exposure, as part of my work with Aotearoa.Indymedia.org.</p>
<p>National Radio are publicly-owned and funded, and currently podcast all their programs in both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats. Student radio stations have also been experimenting with recording their shows and turning them into podcasts, and if they libre licensed the sometimes substantial spoken word parts of recordings like <a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/radio1/" target="_blank">the Radio1 shows shared on MixCloud</a>, they'd be unlikely to miss out on any commercial return.</p>
<p>Community access radio stations, as their name suggests, exist to give special interest groups in our communities access to the airwaves, so their unique voices have a chance to be heard in broadcast media. Access stations are heavily subsidised by public broadcasting funding, and their programs aren't expected to have commercial potential.</p>
<p>Whenever these programs are rebroadcast, both the program producers, and the public who subsidize their production, get more bang for their buck. Over the last decade or so, access radio stations have been building up the infrastructure to digitally record programs, so they can be made available as podcasts, on sites like accessradio.org.</p>
<p>What I notice in all three cases though, is that despite NZGOAL-inspired wave of CC license adoptions across public service organisations from LINZ, to schools and tertiary institutions, to archives and museums, I see no sign of CC licenses on locally made radio so far. I'm guessing one issue is legal confusion and risk aversion.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to CC my radio program, what about the copyright songs I played during the program? Who owns the copyright on ads, and is it acceptable to remove them? Radio stations and rebroadcast sites can pay a fixed fee to collection organisations like NZRIA and APRA for permission to play the songs, but they can't pass on that permission to anyone who rebroadcasts the program.</p>
<p>What can we do to show public radio stations that libre licensing - CC or otherwise - is a good fit for their organizational mission, and help them negotiate the legal minefields around copyright? Between them, the RadioNZ, community access, and students stations have vast numbers of hours of recordings, covering a wide range of kiwi accents spoken regularly on ethnic community radio programs. Having these available under a libre license would have benefits beyond just sharing the information and perspective included in public interest radio programs.</p>
<p>It could also be tremendously helpful to people working on getting free code/ open source speech recognition software to recognise New Zilnd accents, which in turn would be tremendously helpful for any kiwi wanting a speech-operated computer that respects their software freedom. The same would be true for speakers of Te Reo Māori, and other Polynesian languages, who, like NZ English speakers, are also less likely to record enough speech at sites like VoxForge for them to generate a useful acoustic model.</p>
<p>In '<a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html" target="_blank">The Coming Civil War over General Purpose Computing</a>', Cory Doctorow asks us to consider the implications if the proprietary software running on many of our personal computers was instead running on our bionic legs;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If I can lo-jack your legs, I can lease them to you with the confidence of my power to repo them if you default on payments. If I can't, I may not lease you legs unless you've got a lot of money to begin with. But if your legs can decide to walk to the repo-depot without your consent, you will be totally screwed the day that muggers, rapists, griefers or the secret police figure out how to hijack that facility."</p>

<p>Like bionic legs, accessibility tools like speech recognition and text-to-speech are augmentations which restore equalit, helping people with conditions from blindness to quadraplegia to have the full use of computers and the internet that most of us take for granted. Such essential tools should not be subject to the price pumping and hidden agendas that go with proprietary sofware.</p>

<h5>BY MATT MCGREGOR</h5>
<p>Meena Kadri is a Wellington-based photographer, designer and Community Manager for <a href="http://www.openideo.com/profiles/meanestindian/" target="_blank">OpenIDEO</a>, a collaborative innovation and design platform.</p>
<p>A long-time user of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> (under the name Meanest Indian), Meena releases many of her photos under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives licence</a>. Her CC-licensed images have appeared in a variety of newspapers, magazines, blogs and books, and have been licensed for commercial use by companies like <a href="http://au.phaidon.com/agenda/" target="_blank">Phaidon</a> and Apple.</p>
<p>Despite this success, Meena confesses that she “never actually intended to sell my photos—I just wanted to put them online. But pretty soon I realised the potential.”</p>
<p>While teaching at India’s <a href="http://www.nid.edu/" target="_blank">National Institute of Design</a> in the mid 2000s, Meena started using Flickr to source high-quality images for her presentations; by 2006, she was using Flickr to share her own photos. “Flickr was the first social network I’d ever used. I realised pretty quickly how to optimise traffic to my site using tags, especially because I was taking photos of events that were both in demand but under-photographed, such as the Uttarayan Kite Festival in India. It didn’t take long to get my photos on the front page of Flickr image search for certain topics.”</p>
<p>Her most popular set of photos--on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/sets/72157594478128903/" target="_blank">Uttarayan Kite Festival, India</a>--has received over 50,000 views. Other popular sets include <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/sets/72157594428155937/" target="_blank">Indian Street Art</a> (over 40,000 views), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/sets/72057594094242130/" target="_blank">Back View Bollywood</a> (nearly 25,000 views) and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/sets/72057594079156428/" target="_blank">Faces of India</a> (over 19,000 views).</p>
<p>Given the popularity of her Flickr account, her images have featured in countless blogs and presentations. For-profit companies have also paid to use her work, including Serendib, the magazine of Sri Lankan Airlines, and Phaidon Books, who included ten of her images in an Indian cookbook. As Meena explains, “what I usually do in these situations is negotiate. For those people with little or no money, such as NGOs, I usually say go for it. For others, I ask, ‘are you getting paid?’ The implication is that if they are getting paid, then I should be getting paid as well. For them, I charge my standard rate.”</p>
<p>Recently, Meena even licensed one of her Creative Commons licensed photos to Apple, her biggest sale so far. At the same time, Meena ensures that images sold to for-profit companies like Apple and Phaidon remain available for reuse under their original non-commercial Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>As Meena’s images grew in popularity, she experimented with using Getty, a stock image service. While she made a small amount of money from the service, Meena “didn’t like that they required you to use All Rights Reserved. I tried it, because they do move a lot of images, but in the end I decided that I preferred using Creative Commons on Flickr.”</p>
<p>One reason for this is that Creative Commons licences require attribution, which is not the case with stock image services like Getty. As Meena explains, “The Creative Commons licences means that I receive a lot of traffic from having lots of sites—from major technology blogs like Wired to smaller community blogs with loyal followers—link back to my Flickr page."</p>
<p>While Meena is keen to emphasise that the upsides of using Creative Commons licensing greatly outweigh the downsides, she has noticed her images being used without proper attribution. “Every now and then, I’ll find unattributed images and send a nice email asking for attribution. It’s important to be nice, as a lot of people genuinely don’t know how the licences works. I tend to assume it’s a mistake, and send them a link to the licence page.”</p>
<p>Other uses have been more problematic. While visiting her father’s hometown in India, Meena opened a major local newspaper to find one of her images used—for commercial purposes and without attribution—to advertise the upcoming Kite Festival. Meena got in touch with the newspaper, pointed out that they did not have a licence for commercial reuse, and was eventually paid her standard rate.</p>
<p>To prevent unlicensed commercial reuse, Meena only puts web-quality images on her Flickr page. This means that her images are good enough for blogs or slideshow presentations; those wanting to use her images for books or posters, however, will need to ask for a higher resolution.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=meanest+indian&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;authuser=0&amp;ei=JM6JUcbmM4ewkAXg1oDACQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=868&amp;sei=J86JUcbyIcH0kQXirIH4BA" target="_blank">Google Image search for 'Meanest Indian'</a> reveals, Meena's CC-licensed photos are being freely reused all over the web. At the same time, for-profit companies are continuing to pay to licence her work for commercial purposes--a great example of artists making money using Creative Commons Non-Commercial licences.</p>
