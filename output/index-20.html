<p>To make it easier for teachers, librarians and school leaders to get in touch, we're piloting a new project: Creative Commons Clinics for Schools.</p>
<p>We're holding weekly Google Hangouts for those working in the schools sector who are keen to discuss and learn more about copyright and CC.</p>
<p>Because Google Hangouts are limited to ten participants, we'll do our best to take and publish notes from each call, so those who can't make it can follow along. As we go, we'll also fold common questions into new print and online resources.</p>
<p>Sign up using the form below and we'll invite you to the Hangout.</p>
<p>Once you're invited, add an agenda item -- either a topic for discussion, or a question -- to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUatHDt5ARFSgr4WI3VgmUPeCx1MM2Z3bBsKIP_wbWI/edit" target="_blank">the collaborative note-taking document here</a>. Every call is currently slated to start with a very short introduction to CC, which can be shortened or lengthened depending on who signs up.</p>
<p>We're experimenting with two times: one after school, and one during lunchtime (which is likely to change from school to school). If one time proves more popular than the other, we'll make the necessary adjustments. If we haven't got the times right, let us know, and we'll add some more sessions.</p>
<p>We know that schools are busy places, so if you can only come for part of the scheduled time, that's fine - you're still more than welcome to join us.</p>
<p>As this is a new idea, we're very keen for your feedback. Please let us know what you think: matt@creativecommons.org.nz</p>

<p></p>
<p>Two week ago, the New Zealand Open Government Data Programme <a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal2/" target="_blank">announced the release of NZGOAL version 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, NZGOAL is a great piece of government policy, which was approved by Cabinet in 2010. In essence, NZGOAL advocates for the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector.</p>
<p>Some organisations, like Public Service Departments, are directed to use NZGOAL; state services agencies are strongly encouraged, while school Boards of Trustees are invited.</p>
<p>Five years on, we’ve seen a reasonably steady uptake on NZGOAL. Public Service Departments are getting steadily better at using open licensing by default, especially data-heavy agencies like Statistics New Zealand, Land Information New Zealand and Ministry for the Environment.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing uptake in the GLAM sector, with Te Papa, National Library of New Zealand and Auckland Museum all making commitments to open licensing. Schools are also beginning to use CC - we’ve currently got around ninety schools with CC policies, and more to come in the future. Local government and research institutions are also beginning to make moves towards greater openness, which is great to see.</p>
<p>As NZGOAL gradually became the default setting for the release of an increasing number copyright and non-copyright works, New Zealand Open Government Data Programme decided that the policy and guidance materials it uses needed updating.</p>
<p>One important change was the simplification of the review and release process flow-chart. You can read about the other changes <a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal2/#changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Most important, though -- from our point of view at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, at least -- is that Creative Commons HQ finished its exhaustive process of developing <a href="http://creativecommons.org/version4" target="_blank">the 4.0 version of the CC licences</a>.</p>
<p>The original version of NZGOAL recommended the use of the Creative Commons 3.0 New Zealand licences. These licences had been ‘ported’ for New Zealand law. If you’re interested in learning more about this, <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/whats-licence/" target="_blank">check out this interview we conducted with Andrew Matangi</a>, who led the initial porting process.</p>
<p>While there is nothing wrong with the 3.0 NZ licences, the arrival of the 4.0 licences is a welcome opportunity to ensure that everyone in the world is using the same CC licences. The CC licence chooser -- which many people use to get their standard licensing statement -- also puts some hurdles in the way of those people looking for the earlier, ported licences.</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that the NZGOAL team have decided to officially recommend the 4.0 licences. While agencies can still decide to use the older 3.0 NZ licences if they want, the guidance material provided by NZGOAL will recommend the 4.0 licences. Over time, we can expect more and more agencies to go down the CC 4.0 road.</p>
<p>For those of you with works licensed under CC 3.0 NZ -- or any other licence -- you don’t need to worry. This licence is still legally valid and robust, and can still be used to licence your work. And if you want to change, that’s fine too. </p>

<p>On Friday 15 May, Matt is heading south to Invercargill. Thanks to SLANZA, we've managed to organise four back-to-back workshops on the day, which will all take place in the Invercargill Public Library Meeting Room.</p>
<p>If you're keen to attend any or all of these free workshops, please email Kirsty: kadam@jameshargest.school.nz</p>
<p></p>
<h4>9.30-10.30am: Creative Commons for the GLAM sector</h4>
<p>In 2014, both the National Library of New Zealand and Te Papa made significant commitments to release digitised collection items for reuse, under either a Creative Commons licence or a clear ‘no known rights’ statement. In this session, we’ll discuss the ins and outs of open access and open licensing for publicly-housed heritage collections, and talk about practical steps local institutions can take to make their collections more open.</p>
<h4>11-12pm: Creative Commons for research and tertiary education</h4>

<p>Around the world, tertiary education institutions are facing a crisis of affordability. On the one hand, the subscription costs for serials rose 402% between 1986 and 2011, a trend which led Harvard University to declare such increases “fiscally unsustainable.” On the other hand, the costs of student textbooks rose 812% from 1978-2012, increases which have had detrimental effects on both student debt and educational outcomes.</p>
<p>In this session, we’ll discuss how many institutions and funders are adopting policies on open access to research and open educational resources, to ensure that all publicly funded research outputs and educational resources are freely available to access and reuse.</p>
<h4>12.30-1.30pm: Creative Commons for schools</h4>

<p>Ever wondered how to share, adapt and reuse free and open educational resources online, without asking permission or breaking the law? Matt from Creative Commons will show you how.</p>
<p>After giving a quick introduction to copyright, Matt will discuss ins and outs of the free Creative Commons licences, and point to the adoption of a Creative Commons policy by over one hundred New Zealand schools. These policies make it legal for teachers to share resources owned by the Board of Trustees under a Creative Commons licence, so that they can be adapted and reused by others. Matt will also demonstrate how to search for more than 880 million works already available for free under a Creative Commons licence, including research, data, music, images and film.</p>
<h4>2-3pm: Creative Commons for Boards and School Leaders</h4>

<p>With the rise of new sharing portals, such as the Network for Learning’s Pond, more New Zealand teachers are going to be sharing teaching resources online. This is a great development. However, as teachers share more openly, schools will need to take greater care regarding their copyright policies, to ensure that teachers know exactly what they can and cannot do with works created during the course of their employment.</p>
<p>In this session, Matt from Creative Commons will provide an overview to copyright in schools, and show how over one hundred schools have used free Creative Commons licensing policies to provide greater certainty to teachers, school leaders and Boards of Trustees on the use and reuse of copyright works. Matt will also provide and walk through a template Creative Commons copyright policy, and discuss how a CC policy might be implemented with teaching staff.</p>

<p>For the month of March (and a little bit of April), Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand have been travelling around New Zealand spreading the word about open access and open licensing for local Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums. In case you didn't make it to any of these events, we've embedded the slides below, along with a short summary of what they said.</p>
<p></p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Matt McGregor and Elizabeth Heritage, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</span></h5>
<p>Matt and Elizabeth began by introducing Creative Commons licensing in Aotearoa New Zealand. They then noted that, while new technologies had provided heritage organisations new opportunities to share their digital collections for reuse, copyright and licensing was still a significant barrier. Usage rights statements, they said, were often vague, overly restrictive &amp; not standardised across the sector. They then ran through three specific recommendations, outlined in the slides, before giving a brief introduction to the licences themselves.</p>
<p>[slideshare id=46702250&amp;w=476&amp;h=400&amp;sc=no]</p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Keitha Booth, New Zealand Open Government Information and Data Programme</span></h5>

<p>Keitha introduced the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework, which advocates for the use of CC licensing across the state sector. Keitha noted that the Open Government Data and Information Programme had expanded its focus to local government. She outlined the NZGOAL adoption process, and the policy framework for each institution, both of which are detailed in the slides, below.</p>
<p>[slideshare id=46702435&amp;w=476&amp;h=400&amp;sc=no]</p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Victoria Leachman, Rights Advisor, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa</span></h5>

<p>Victoria outlined Te Papa's experiences with Creative Commons licensing, beginning with the Rita Angus podcasts in 2008. Victoria noted that CC licensing these podcasts had enabled them to be used by other institutions touring the exhibition - without Te Papa having to write detailed usage agreements. After running through several other CC projects, Victoria discussed the download project, which has so far released over 48,000 images for free high-resolution download. Victoria noted that usage was much greater than predicted at the beginning of the project, and that it was being used for a range of purposes. Victoria closed her presentation by outlining the challenges to open access and open licensing for the GLAM sector, and highlighting the approach taken thus far by Te Papa.</p>
<p>[slideshare id=46702446&amp;w=476&amp;h=400&amp;sc=no]</p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager, DigitalNZ</span></h5>

<p>After introducing DigitalNZ and its mission, Thomasin showed the famous 'magic hat' diagram, which outlines how content from individuals and organisations around New Zealand is harvested by the DigitalNZ and made more easily searchable by the aforementioned magic hat (otherwise known as the DigitalNZ API). She then gave an overview of DigitalNZ's approach to rights, and pointed out some of the common issues faced by DigitalNZ as it attempts to provide clear rights information to end users. Thomasin argued that the point of working through these rights issues was to help produce "A world in which our shared cultural heritage is open to all, regardless of their background. A world in which people are no longer passive consumers of cultural content created by an elite, but contribute, participate, create and share." Thomasin concluded by several standout local and international open GLAM case studies.</p>
<p>[slideshare id=46702442&amp;w=476&amp;h=400&amp;sc=no]</p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader, The Alexander Turnbull Library</span></h5>

<p>Mark began by noting that the internal debates around use and reuse within the National Library of New Zealand repeated debates that are taking place in society at large. Many of the issues arodund reusing collection items were difficult, and many of them turned on the notion of trust. Mark then noted that rights statements across the sector were inconsistent, and that the National Library of New Zealand had developed a set of policy principles to addressed this inconsistency, which are outlined in the slides. Implementation, he said, was ongoing, though three issues currently being addressed were donor and depositor agreements, a flowchart to guide the release process and improving the rights statements and licensing on indigenous knowledge works.</p>
<p>[slideshare id=46702437&amp;w=476&amp;h=400&amp;sc=no]</p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Allison Brown, Digital Services Coordinator, University of Otago Library</span></h5>

<p>Allison discussed the use of Creative Commons licensing within the University of Otago library. In particular, she gave her experience in discussing CC licensing with rights holders, applying CC licensing in a library context, supporting the use of CC by others, managing the use of CC and promoting CC to others.</p>

<p>Educational resources are becoming increasingly unaffordable: since 1978, textbook prices have risen 812%. According to research from the US Public Interest Research Groups, 65% of students choose not to buy a college textbook because it’s too expensive and 94% report that they suffer academically because of this choice.</p>
<p>As a result, more and more educators -- and higher education institutions -- have committed to develop and reuse <a title="Open Education" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/education/">Open Educational Resources</a> (OERs). OERs are resources that made openly available, free of technical, legal and price restrictions on reuse.</p>
<p>Come along to hear about the future of Open Educational Resources in Aotearoa, featuring:</p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Billy Meinke, formerly of Creative Commons International, who will talk about his experience with some of the world's largest OER projects, including the US Government's $2billion TAAACT grants for OERs at community colleges.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Simon Hart, Richard White and Erika Pearson from the Media Text Hack team at the University of Otago, who will talk about the development of an open, CC-licensed Media Studies textbook -- over the course of a weekend.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Matt McGregor, Public Lead of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, who will talk about the future of OERs in the New Zealand tertiary sector, and how educators and institutions can create, use and adopt open textbooks.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
