<p>Based in Auckland, New Zealand, <a href="http://hicksvillecomics.com/" target="_blank">Dylan Horrocks</a> is best known as the author of the award winning <a href="http://vup.victoria.ac.nz/hicksville/" target="_blank"><em>Hicksville</em></a>, a story of a small, comics-obsessed town on New Zealand’s East Coast.</p>
<p><em>Hicksville </em>was named a 'book of the year’ by <em>Comics Journal</em> and features in Auckland University Press’s <a href="http://www.press.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/notices/template/notice_item.jsp?cid=502785" target="_blank"><em>Anthology of New Zealand Literature</em></a>, alongside canonical New Zealand writers James K Baxter, Maurice Gee and Katherine Mansfield.</p>
<p>Dylan is also a long-time supporter of Creative Commons. In fact, since 2009, Dylan has been releasing his work on his website under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>. Users can find finished stories and ongoing serials, including <a href="http://hicksvillecomics.com/magicpen/?p=14" target="_blank"><em>Sam Zabel and the Magic Pen</em></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Dylan-Horrocks-The-American-Dream.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3244 " title="Dylan Horrocks The American Dream" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Dylan-Horrocks-The-American-Dream.jpg" alt="" width="340" height="504"></a> <a href="http://hicksvillecomics.com/americandream/?p=56">The American Dream</a>, Page 13, by Dylan Horrocks.

<p>Dylan first became interested in the the relation between copyright and culture when, as a young comics reader, he saw how many authors had lost the rights to their works—including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman#Publication_history" target="_blank">Siegel and Shuster, the creators of Superman</a>, who sold their work to National Periodicals (later, DC comics).</p>
<p>As Dylan relates, “When freelancers got paid in the early comics industry, they had to sign the back of the cheque to cash it. On the back of the cheque, though, was a printed statement, which basically said ‘all rights to this story and the characters contained therein are hereby handed in perpetuity to the publisher.’</p>
<p>“The key lesson was: never sell your copyright to a company. For a long time, my view of copyright was that it was very, very important for the artist and that you must hold on to it, no matter what.”</p>
<p>Dylan’s view of copyright changed when, in the process of researching a guest lecture for Auckland University, he realised the potential effects of the Internet on the production and distribution of culture.</p>
<p>“I kind of had this revelation: The ease with which media can be copied when it’s digital, and the ease with which it can be distributed through the Internet, offers us an extraordinary historic opportunity.</p>
<p>“Surely we’ve always dreamed of a civilisation in which everyone has access to ideas, without the constraint of shipping piles of paper around the world. As an afterthought, I considered how that would affect the economics of distribution. Having thought about that, I concluded that it might mean the end of royalties. I think it took me two minutes to decide that I was fine with that.”</p>
<p>Dylan realised that the Internet had the potential to expand public access to our rich cultural heritage, including comics. “I’ve spent much of my life hearing rumours of a really interesting comics project, or catching a glimpse of it in some history book about comics, and thinking, I wish I could get my hands on that, and then working so hard looking for ways to access it.”</p>
<p>Dylan talks about Finnish writer and cartoonist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tove_Jansson" target="_blank">Tove Jansson</a>, best known as the inventor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomin" target="_blank">Moomins</a>. For years, Dylan was unaware that Jannson had drawn a comic strip, until he came across a reference to her in German history of comics. After receiving a photocopy of the comic from historian <a href="http://www.paulgravett.com/" target="_blank">Paul Gravett</a>, Dylan decided to run off thirty more copies and give them away to other cartoonists around the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Horrocks-Sam-Zabel-P2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3247 " title="Horrocks Sam Zabel P2" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Horrocks-Sam-Zabel-P2.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="457"></a> <a href="http://hicksvillecomics.com/magicpen/?p=15">The Magic Pen</a>, Page 2, by Dylan Horrocks. This image is made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 New Zealand licence</a></p>
<p>“Eventually, a few years later, my publisher <a href="http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/" target="_blank">Drawn and Quarterly</a> started republishing those comics. They’re selling really well and it’s rewriting the history of comics.”</p>
<p>With the Internet, these practices of sharing and reuse are becoming increasingly common. As Dylan puts it, this is “a fantastic gift to the whole culture. I have access to a vastly greater landscape of recorded culture than any previous generation, and that’s going to change the way artists work. I already see it in the work of younger artists.”</p>
<p>By using a Creative Commons licence on his own work, Dylan hopes that younger artists will be encouraged to remix and adapt their own version of <em>The American Dream</em> or <em>Sam Zabel and the Magic Pen</em>.</p>
<p>As Dylan puts it, “I don’t object to people sharing my work and I don’t object to people using my work as an inspiration for new work, because both for me are really gratifying. It shows that people are engaging with my work and they’re excited by it.</p>
<p>“If people are sharing it around, more people are reading it. The idea that it’s inspiring other people to do new work is gratifying, especially because my work in turn is inspired by other people.”</p>
<p>Creative Commons provides Dylan with an alternative to what he sees as a narrow—but dominant—vision of culture and art. “When I make a piece of art, it’s me responding to a whole lot of art and the world around me. When I finish it, I want it to go back into that flow of art and ideas, and be shared and responded to by people. Treating it as a single piece of property seems wrong. Lots of people have a relationship to that piece of art.”</p>
<p>[quote float="right"]If my comic is photocopied or scanned by a 14 year old and given to his girlfriend—man, I love that[/quote]</p>
<p>Dylan decided to apply a Non-Commercial licence, to ensure that commercial publishers wouldn’t distribute his work without his express permission.</p>
<p>“Part of what appeals to me about CC is that the CC licences that I prefer—which tends to be Attribution-Non-Commercial—far more accurately reflect my preference as an author about how my work is used. The idea of some 14 year old getting to read their work and not paying them really doesn’t bug most writers. We don’t want to put walls up around our work. We just don’t want people getting rich off it, without us.</p>
<p>“Creative Commons doesn’t actually take any of the rights I care about as an author. If someone wants to make a big Hollywood film or sell tee-shirts, they can get in touch, just as they can under copyright. And if there is going to be money changing hands, then some of that money should be coming to me.”</p>
<p>Currently, Dylan’s printed comics are not released under a Creative Commons licence. While acknowledging that open licensing could actually <em>increase</em> sales, he notes that many publishers continue to be cautious about copyright. “The fact that I’m serialising stuff online while I’m working on it does cause problems with publishers. It’s an ongoing process. That’s something for the CC community to help with—helping artists who want to use CC to find ways to bring publishers and traditional distributors on board.”</p>
<p>Dylan hopes that his use of Creative Commons licences on his website will encourage young artists to share and adapt his work. “If my comic is photocopied or scanned by a 14 year old and given to his girlfriend—man, I love that. Or if someone wants to make a teeshirt of my comic to give as a present for Christmas, go for it. Creative Commons reflects my own personal ethics about how my work is used.”</p>

Researchers, academics, students and members of the public will discuss  the benefits of openness in academic research, as well as the institutional, legal and social barriers to implementing open research and open access models.</p>
<p>The conference will begin by looking at how open research can be supported through research methods and processes, including funding mandates and the use of new, community-centred technologies. Following this, the second section of day one will bring the worldwide open access movement into Australian and New Zealand contexts, with special regard to publicly funded research. Finally, Don Christie of Catalyst IT will look into intellectual property and business models of ‘open products.'</p>
<p>Day two will be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>, an open discussion amongst conference-goers and the wider community, aimed at exploring ways of making Open Research happen on both sides of the Tasman.</p>
<p>On day 3, a small group of participants will draft an Open Research declaration, to support the moves towards open access to scholarly publishing in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is proud to support open access and open licensing for scholarly research, and it would be great to see our Auckland-based community get involved.</p>
<p>For more information about the conference, and to register, visit the<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nzauopenresearch/"> Open Research site</a>. Registration is only $20.</p>

             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2013-01-09T21:41:42+13:00">2013-01-09 21:41</time>

<p></p>
<a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/" target="_blank">UC CEISMIC</a> is a federated archive of materials from the Canterbury earthquakes, hosted by the <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank">University of Canterbury</a>, which launched in November 2011. With content provided by major New Zealand cultural institutions, like <a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Te Papa</a> and the<a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank"> National Library</a>, as well as ordinary New Zealanders, the archive is an extraordinary—and extraordinarily open—digital resource.
<p>The idea for the archive began when <a href="http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/engl/people/millar.shtml" target="_blank">Associate Professor Paul Millar</a> from the Department of English at the University of Canterbury approached <a href="http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/engl/people/smithies.shtml" target="_blank">Dr James Smithies</a>, then working at the Ministry of Health, about what he could do in response to the February earthquakes.</p>
<p>James pointed Paul to the 9/11 archive, organised by the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">Center for History and New Media</a> at George Mason University. They also considered the <a href="http://hurricanearchive.org/" target="_blank">Hurricane Memory Bank</a>, a project designed to collect and preserve stories from hurricanes Rita and Katrina. Paul pitched the idea to the university’s Senior Management team and received a very positive response. He immediately began tireless work to get James down to Christchurch and turn the idea into reality.</p>
<p>With these projects in mind, James and Paul considered how they might build something similar for the Canterbury earthquakes. As James put it, the team soon decided that they “would just go out and collect everything.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/programme-team" target="_blank">Dr Christopher Thomson</a>, Programme Office Manager for UC CEISMIC, outlined the steps James and Paul had to take to get the archive online.</p>
<p>“They put a proposal to the university and got some funding to set something up. From there, they started have conversations with people across the cultural heritage sector, and saw that lots of people were asking the same kinds of questions about an archive for the Canterbury earthquakes.</p>
<p>“They then decided to set up the UC CEISMIC consortium.”</p>
<p>The UC CEISMIC consortium is led by the University of Canterbury and made up of organisations from across the cultural heritage sector, including <a href="http://archives.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Archives New Zealand</a>, the <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank">National Library of New Zealand</a>, the <a href="http://www.mch.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Ministry for Culture</a><a href="http://www.mch.govt.nz/" target="_blank"> and Heritage</a>, the <a href="http://www.canterburymuseum.com/" target="_blank">Canterbury Museum</a>, <a href="http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/" target="_blank">Christchurch City Libraries</a>, <a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/" target="_blank">NZ OnScreen</a>, the <a href="http://www.ntrc.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank">Ngai Tahu Research Centre</a>, <a href="http://cera.govt.nz/" target="_blank">CERA</a>, <a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Te Papa</a> and the <a href="http://www.filmarchive.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Film Archive</a>.</p>
<p>As Christopher puts it, “the idea was that each of the consortium members would collect their own material and archive it according to their own policies, and then use <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a> to surface it in one place, so that users could search for earthquake-related content at ceismic.org.nz.”</p>
<p>So where does Creative Commons come in? Given the ambitions of the project, in these early stages “Creative Commons wasn’t in the mix.” Later, though, James began to introduce the idea of open licensing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">James had been a Creative Commons supporter for years, had strong support from Paul to investigate CC licenses, and was offered excellent advice from Jason Darwin at CWA New Media (later <a href="http://www.learningmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank">Learning Media Limited</a>). He understood the problems ‘All Rights Reserved’ copyright can pose for heritage projects, though, and soon found there were issues having multiple licensing agreements across different sections of the project.</p>

<p>The problem was handed to Christopher Thomson when he arrived in the team. However, little progress could be made, despite his best efforts and those of a range of stakeholders. The problem was worst with research–oriented data, which had specific issues related to ethics and privacy.</p>
<p>In the end, when approaching potential depositors, the UC CEISMIC team recommended the use of Creative Commons licences, though remained open to more restrictive licensing agreements, according to the specific needs of content providers.</p>
<p>The archive launched in November 2011, with ten thousand items, and continues to grow.</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury’s specific contribution to the consortium is called <a href="https://quakestudies.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank">UC QuakeStudies</a>, and includes materials from <a href="http://www.fairfaxmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank">Fairfax Media</a>, <a href="http://www.crc.govt.nz/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Environment Canterbury</a> and the <a href="http://www.historic.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Historic Places Trust</a>. While much of this content remains All Rights Reserved, the archive has recently added a collection by Murray Quartly, who runs <a href="http://www.focus360.co.nz/" target="_blank">focus360.co.nz</a>.</p>
<p>After the earthquakes, Murray took a series of 360 degree panorama photographs of central Christchurch, producing what Christopher describes as a “virtual tour of the Red Zone.” After meeting with the UC CEISMIC team, Quartly decided to release the photos under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives licence</a>.</p>
<p>Several more collections are ready to go live, and dozens more planned. Creative Commons will be used as much as possible, and it is hoped that a full review can be undertaken in years to come that assess opportunities to migrate targeted collections to CC licenses.</p>
<p>Another significant part of the consortium is QuakeStories, which is run by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. This archive contains stories and photos from the earthquake from ordinary New Zealanders, and is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share-Alike licence</a>.</p>
<p>Both Christopher and James suggest that the biggest hurdles to using Creative Commons licences have come from researchers—especially those working through the University’s ethics committee, which is already a complex process.</p>
<p>The UC CEISMIC team continue to encourage their partners to use open licensing, wherever possible, and Creative Commons licences remain a core part of the UC CEISMIC programme.</p>
<p>As Christopher points out, “We don’t really know how people are going to use our content. It makes sense to make it open wherever possible, because we don’t know what research questions and methods will be like in 100 years’ time. We want to leave that open as far as possible, for the future.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">James had been a Creative Commons supporter for years, had strong support from Paul to investigate CC licenses, and was offered excellent advice from Jason Darwin at CWA New Media (later <a href="http://www.learningmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank">Learning Media Limited</a>). He understood the problems ‘All Rights Reserved’ copyright can pose for heritage projects, though, and soon found there were issues having multiple licensing agreements across different sections of the project.</p>

<p>The problem was handed to Christopher Thomson when he arrived in the team. However, little progress could be made, despite his best efforts and those of a range of stakeholders. The problem was worst with research–oriented data, which had specific issues related to ethics and privacy.</p>
<p>[quote float="right"]We don’t really know how people are going to use our content... We want to leave that open as far as possible, for the future.[/quote]</p>
<p>In the end, when approaching potential depositors, the UC CEISMIC team recommended the use of Creative Commons licences, though remained open to more restrictive licensing agreements, according to the specific needs of content providers.</p>
<p>The archive launched in November 2011, with ten thousand items, and continues to grow.</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury’s specific contribution to the consortium is called <a href="https://quakestudies.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank">UC QuakeStudies</a>, and includes materials from <a href="http://www.fairfaxmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank">Fairfax Media</a>, <a href="http://www.crc.govt.nz/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Environment Canterbury</a> and the <a href="http://www.historic.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Historic Places Trust</a>. While much of this content remains All Rights Reserved, the archive has recently added a collection by Murray Quartly, who runs <a href="http://www.focus360.co.nz/" target="_blank">focus360.co.nz</a>.</p>
<p>After the earthquakes, Murray took a series of 360 degree panorama photographs of central Christchurch, producing what Christopher describes as a “virtual tour of the Red Zone.” After meeting with the UC CEISMIC team, Quartly decided to release the photos under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives licence</a>.</p>
<p>Several more collections are ready to go live, and dozens more planned. Creative Commons will be used as much as possible, and it is hoped that a full review can be undertaken in years to come that assess opportunities to migrate targeted collections to CC licenses.</p>
<p>Another significant part of the consortium is QuakeStories, which is run by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. This archive contains stories and photos from the earthquake from ordinary New Zealanders, and is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share-Alike licence</a>.</p>
<p>Both Christopher and James suggest that the biggest hurdles to using Creative Commons licences have come from researchers—especially those working through the University’s ethics committee, which is already a complex process.</p>
<p>The UC CEISMIC team continue to encourage their partners to use open licensing, wherever possible, and Creative Commons licences remain a core part of the UC CEISMIC programme.</p>
<p>As Christopher points out, “We don’t really know how people are going to use our content. It makes sense to make it open wherever possible, because we don’t know what research questions and methods will be like in 100 years’ time. We want to leave that open as far as possible, for the future.”</p>

<a href="http://www.nzta.govt.nz/" target="_blank">The New Zealand Transport Agency</a> (NZTA) is one of New Zealand’s largest producers of spatial data. Since August 2012, the organisation has been uploading its aerial imagery to <a href="http://koordinates.com/" target="_blank">Koordinates</a>, a platform for geospatial datasets, under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence.</a>
<p>The spatial team has been considering how to open its data since the release of the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal" target="_blank">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing (NZGOAL) framework</a>, approved by Cabinet in July 2010. According to Geospatial Specialist Chris Worts, “We realised that this is something we should be doing more. There was nothing stopping us.”</p>
<p>NZTA produces a range of datasets, many of which were available on request. For members of the public, though, this wasn’t necessarily obvious; nor was the process of disseminating the data straight-forward.</p>
<p>When NZTA received a request, someone in the spatial team—often Chris himself—would have to manually extract the data. “It would be a case of emailing data or copying the data onto hard drives and sending it out, which can be labour intensive.”</p>
<p>With hosting platforms like Koordinates—coupled with free open licenses like Creative Commons—it’s become much easier for the public to find and reuse publicly funded datasets. Koordinates provides an ideal platform for NZTA to start releasing their own spatial data, as it is both popular and easy to use.</p>
<p>Before uploading the datasets to Koordinates, Chris had received only handful of enquiries. In the three months since then, the datasets have received <a href="http://koordinates.com/#/maps/nzta/layers/" target="_blank">thousands of views and over 700 downloads</a>—an exponential rise in the reuse of NZTA’s datasets.</p>
<p>Their experience supports <a href="http://www.geospatial.govt.nz/linz-media-release-spatial-information-adds-hundreds-of-millions-to-new-zealand-s-economy/" target="_blank">a 2009 report from Land Information New Zealand</a>. As the report concludes, the financial benefit of opening publicly funded spatial data is enormous:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Had key barriers [to the reuse of publicly funded spatial data] been removed it is estimated that New Zealand could have benefited from an additional $481 million in productivity-related benefits in 2008, generating at least $100 million in government revenue” (ix).</p>

<p>While it's hard to argue with such a conclusion, the process of actually releasing the datasets can be quite complex. Not all datasets produced by NZTA are suitable for public reuse.</p>
<p>Some datasets, for example, might not be accurate in two or three years--or even two or three days--time; also, many are designed for a specific use, and are therefore not suitable for wide release. For this reason, Chris highlights the importance of “providing accurate metadata, so that users know the limitations of a dataset and how, when and why the data was created”.</p>
<p>While the spatial team has no concrete plans to release more datasets, Chris says that the team will continue to release datasets as appropriate in the future.</p>
<p>Other areas of NZTA have also started to embrace Creative Commons licensing. Like many public agencies, NZTA produces an enormous range of content, including advertisements, reports, videos and images. <a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/" target="_blank">NZTA's Education Team</a> recently ran a <a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/competitions/the-nzta-remix-competition-safer-journeys-for-teens" target="_blank">successful remix competition</a>. The winners included Tawa College’s Drink Driving Website and Darfield High Schools Shakepearean Warrant of Fitness Advertisement.</p>

<p>Like other government agencies, it looks like NZTA is starting to join the commons. Chris points to a shift in mindset within the organisation.</p>
<p>“It is something different that’s running through your mind now, it’s not just, what can I use it for? Instead we ask, what are the potential wider benefits?”</p>

<p></p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.whs.school.nz/" target="_blank">Wellington High School (WHS)</a> became the first Wellington school to adopt a Creative Commons policy, which mandates a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution licence</a> for all teaching materials.</p>
<p>Under their Creative Commons policy, the teachers of WHS can share, remix and reuse their teaching materials—including quizzes, lesson plans and classroom activities—without having to ask their Board of Trustees for permission.</p>
<p>Before WHS adopted their Creative Commons policy, those teachers that shared their materials online would have been in violation of copyright. This is because, like other New Zealand schools, the copyright to all teaching materials created by WHS teachers in the course of their employment <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/Copyright-in-Schools/Guidelines-for-schools/For-teachers-and-contractors/Overview-of-copyright-issues#teacher" target="_blank">is held by the WHS Board of Trustees</a>.</p>
<p>As every teacher knows, sharing is a crucial part of education; and <a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/" target="_blank">with the rollout of Ultra-Fast Broadband</a> and the growing use of portable devices, school leaders are realising that there is an extraordinary capacity to share, adapt and collaborate with others across New Zealand. Without a Creative Commons policy, there is a chance that this potential will remain unrealised.</p>
<p>Changing policies, though, is a big step. How did WHS go about it? The process started on the 23rd of November, 2010, when Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand and the OER Foundation hosted <a href="http://wikieducator.org/WeCreate/Events" target="_blank">WeCreate, a Creative Commons workshop for New Zealand educators</a>. With support from the Ministry of Education, the workshop was attended by over 30 Wellington school leaders.</p>
<p>The workshop introduced the suite of Creative Commons licences, outlined <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/" target="_blank">the New Zealand Government’s position on open licensing</a> and encouraged schools to develop policies to allow the development of <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/" target="_blank">Open Education Resources (OERs)</a>. Among the attendees were WHS Classics teacher Trudy Harvey and Librarian Jane Shallcrass.</p>
<p>As Jane put it, “We saw the Albany Senior High School Creative Commons policy and when we came back to school, we decided we should do something about it. We met with one of the Deputy Principals, gave them a copy of the policy and said, ‘we think we should have one of these at our school.’”</p>
<p>As one of the first schools in New Zealand to mandate Creative Commons licensing, school leaders at Wellington High School spent the next year considering the policy. Embracing the Creative Commons ethos, school leaders at Wellington High adapted <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank">the existing Creative Commons policy from Albany Senior High School</a>; this was approved at a board meeting in early 2012.</p>
<p>For Trudy and Jane, this was good news. When the new policy was announced, however, some of the school’s teachers were concerned. Their problem, though, was not Creative Commons--their problem was <em>copyright</em>. Some teachers were worried that the copyright to any work they brought into the classroom—everything from photos to computer programmes—would be automatically owned by the school.</p>
<p>While this is not the case, school leaders were careful to bring more complex cases to the BoT, who made it clear that they had no desire to assert copyright over such works. The school is considering making alterations to the policy to address exceptional cases.</p>
<p>As Jane pointed out, these anxieties about copyright underscore the importance of a Creative Commons policy. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank">The easy to understand Creative Commons licences </a>cut through the ambiguities and uncertainties of copyright, ensuring that teachers can legally share and collaborate, without going through the motions of asking permission--or, even worse, breaking the law.</p>
<p>While the Creative Commons policy at WHS is less than a year old, many teachers have started--or continued--to use Creative Commons licences, on everything from general teaching resources to professional development presentations and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTXeuuotjc" target="_blank">videos of school events</a> (including their recent prize-giving). Jane looks forward to seeing more examples of sharing, remix and reuse in 2013.</p>

<p>Last month, we announced at the National Digital Forum and Nethui South that we, in partnership with DigitalNZ, would be running <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/">Mix &amp; Mash 2013: The New Storytelling.</a> We're extremely pleased that <a href="http://www.orcon.net.nz/">Orcon</a> is sponsoring our first issue, and that <a href="http://www.squiz.co.nz/">Squiz</a> is sponsoring the Supreme Winner. We'll announce other sponsors over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>This is going to be a major initiative for Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, as more and more schools start to adopt Creative Commons policies for their teaching materials. We especially want to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>demonstrate the range and value of New Zealand openly licensed and public domain materials;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>increase the profile of Creative Commons licensed materials, including open educational resources and Creative Commons policies, in New Zealand schools; and,<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>educate New Zealand students on copyright, licensing and reuse.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<p>Sounds good, doesn't it? Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand was a proud sponsor of earlier versions of the competition, but this year we're especially excited to be sitting front and centre.</p>
<p>So, how's it going to work? And how's it different from <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2010-winners/" target="_blank">the Mixes and Mashes of earlier years</a>?</p>
<p>First of all, this is going to be less a one-off 'competition' than an ongoing showcase: we really want to show off the creative work of kiwi students and the public. This means that there'll be three deadlines--in May, August and November--equating to three main 'issues' of student work, which means in turn that there'll be plenty of opportunities for students to share their work with the global Creative Commons community.</p>
<p>But we also want to show off the amazing range of public domain and Creative Commons materials <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">accessible through DigitalNZ</a>, so we're also going to highlight some of those materials for students to adapt, remix &amp; reuse.</p>
<p>We're also cutting down on the categories, to keep everything nice and simple!</p>
<p>And what will entries look like? Well, we don't really know--we want New Zealand's young people, as well members of the public, to show <em>us</em> what new storytelling looks like--but we have an idea. It could be a familiar form, such as a poem or a short-story; it could include video, music, animation, painting or comics; it could be something utterly surprising, something we never expected.</p>
<p>But, since you asked, here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2010, Jem Yoshioka won the ‘ Mix and Mash Supreme Creative Remix’ with ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2010-winners/supreme-remix">An Opal Dream Cave,</a>’ her reinvention of Katherine Mansfield’s poem ‘The Opal Dream Cave’ and a variety of public domain materials.</li>

    <li>In 2011, Alan Zia won the ‘Mix and Mash Literature Remix’ with ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/literature-remix/">Crossed Cultures,</a>’ his remix of Renee Liang’s ‘Crossed Cultures’ and Dylan Horrocks ‘Siso.’</li>

    <li>In 2011, Candy Elsemore won the ‘Mix and Mash Supreme Creative Remix’ with ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/supreme-creative-remix/">A Grand Mother</a>,’ a digital story which made use of a variety of openly licensed archival materials.</li>

    <li>In 2011, Rita Godlevskis won the ‘ Mix and Mash Digital Story’ category for ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/digital-story/">New Zealand,</a>’ which also made used of a variety of public domain materials from New Zealand libraries and archives.</li>

</ul>

I'm a sucker for anything that makes me cry."</p>

<h5>By Danyl Strype</h5>
<p>[<em>This is an opinion piece from a member the Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ community. If you want to write for us, please email admin@creativecommons.org.nz</em>]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1XZHVYqenw" target="_blank">DIY MySpam</a> is a song and video by independent musician Jayme Gutierrez, which sings the praises of the share and donate business model</p>
<p>One point Jayme's playful lyrics make is that for most of the history of recorded music, the successful artists and songs have been chosen by corporate gatekeepers, which increasingly own both the major music labels which manufacture and sell musical commodities, and the mass media channels which promote them. However, in the decentralized social media culture of the web, we the audience decide which musicians becomes prominent, via the network effect of sharing music we like in our social networks and patronising its creators through direct donations and crowdfunding campaigns.</p>
<p>Although Jayme Gutierrez doesn't appear to use CreativeCommons licenses yet, he does offer 'magnet links' on his own homepage, <a href="http://www.jaymegutierrez.com/music.html" target="_blank">to help people freely torrent his music</a>.</p>
<p>This must be deeply confusing to anyone who buys into the anti-BitTorrent hysteria, which has resulted in dawn raids on Kim Dotcom's family home, and threatens UK webmaster Richard O'Dwyer with extradition to the US for copyright violation. How could anyone hope to make a living out of music without trying desperately to generate profit through creating artificial scarcity? Jayme is relying on the what Malcolm Gladwell, author of 'The Tipping Point', calls the "stickiness factor". He hopes that having his music circulating freely online will attract people to his website to make  donations, or offer him paid jobs as a composer and musician.</p>
<p>Could these tactics of self-production and self-promotion to a global audience be the future for budding musicians, and indeed artists of all kinds? These digital tools do open up a plethora of opportunities for hobby musicians (and for those whose political ideologies reject commercialization entirely), but contrary to the self-serving propaganda of the recording industry associations, the change we are seeing is not from music-making being a paid activity, to being an unpaid activity.</p>
<p>Rather, it is a change away from an extremely well-paid activity for a handful of mega-stars, and the corporate bureaucracy that has grown up around them. A change to a paid activity for anyone who can find success in the share and donate economy - the native economy of the Internet.  A true "free market" in a way that a market dependent on the corporate welfare of a state-enforced monopoly like copyright can never honestly claim to be. We the audience decide, with our 'Likes' and our pledges, who makes a living out of their music. This could be seen as the first steps towards a radical democratization of culture (and indeed investment).</p>
<p>If so, what role does that leave for people who make their living off the "content industries"? It's the same question faced by people working in fossil fuel industries, as communities transition to renewable energy, and by chemical industries as people increasingly join the "slow food" movement, and choose 'organic and 'spray-free''. These are questions which public organisations, whether they be part of governmental or civil society, can help to answer. At heart though, they are exactly the sort of questions we need artistic (and academic) freedom to answer. Freedom which the beneficiaries of the "content industries" are desperate to see taken away. We must not let them succeed, for our own sake, but also for theirs.</p>
