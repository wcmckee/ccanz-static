The New Zealand government has taken positive steps toward open access licensing this winter as the 'NZGOAL framework' has been aproved by Cabinet. Part of the framework's purpose is to provide guidance on licensing of government copyright works for re-use using Creative Commons licences.



The release of NZGOAL was announced by the Minister of State Services late last week. <a href="http://www.e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal" target="_blank">The framework</a> (itself <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">CC BY 3.0 NZ</a>) and additional materials are <a href="http://www.e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal" target="_blank">available here</a> with a press release on the E-government website.</body></html>
