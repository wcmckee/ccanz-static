<h2>Using Creative Commons content</h2>

If you've new to the Creative Commons licences and have found some CC material you'd like to use for the competition, take a look at our <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences_explained__1" target="_self">licences explained page</a> or <a href="mailto:admin@creativecommons.org.nz" target="_self">get in contact</a> for some friendly tips on how it all works (not legal advice).



This competition is very important for rewarding those who can re-use content and datasets in ways that are creative, that solve real world problems or display a truly innovative spark. We encourage the New Zealand Creative Commons community to get involved, since showcasing what can be done with open access materials encourages our State Agencies and cultural institutions to apply open access wherever they can. The more we creatively draw upon our Kiwi commons, the more reason we have for unlocking knowledge for the benefit of all.</body></html>
