On 6 &amp; 7 February 2013, the University of Auckland is hosting the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nzauopenresearch/" target="_blank">NZ AU Open Research conference</a>, with support from Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand. Researchers, academics, students and members of the public will discuss  the benefits of openness in academic research, as well as the institutional, legal and social barriers to implementing open research and open access models.



The conference will begin by looking at how open research can be supported through research methods and processes, including funding mandates and the use of new, community-centred technologies. Following this, the second section of day one will bring the worldwide open access movement into Australian and New Zealand contexts, with special regard to publicly funded research. Finally, Don Christie of Catalyst IT will look into intellectual property and business models of ‘open products.'



Day two will be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>, an open discussion amongst conference-goers and the wider community, aimed at exploring ways of making Open Research happen on both sides of the Tasman.



On day 3, a small group of participants will draft an Open Research declaration, to support the moves towards open access to scholarly publishing in Aotearoa New Zealand.



Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is proud to support open access and open licensing for scholarly research, and it would be great to see our Auckland-based community get involved.
