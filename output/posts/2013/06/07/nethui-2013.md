TUESDAY 9 July 2013, 6pm-7.15pm at NetHui 2013, Room: Square Affair 2, Wellington Town Hall



Across the world, museums, galleries, archives, libraries and broadcasters—from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/arts/design/museums-mull-public-use-of-online-art-images.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">the Rijksmuseum</a> in The Netherlands to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/archives/openarchives.htm" target="_blank">ABC Australia</a>—are using Creative Commons licences and clear ‘no known copyright’ statements to open their collections for greater public access and reuse.



What are some of the challenges in opening New Zealand’s publicly funded and publicly housed culture and heritage? And what developments can we expect in the years ahead?



Join us for a wide-ranging, open discussion on copyright and Creative Commons in the culture and heritage sector.



Speakers include:

<ul>

	<li>Courtney Johnston, Director, Hutt City Museums</li>

	<li>Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader, Alexander Turnbull Library</li>

	<li>Victoria Leachman, Rights Advisor, Te Papa Tongarewa</li>

	<li>Brenda Leeuwenberg, Digital Advisor, NZ On Air</li>

</ul>
