Many of us have worked on really interesting projects involving Creative Commons licences. Some of us have encountered some expected and unexpected challenges along the way.



Come to this meeting to share the cool projects happening right here in Wellington, and learn from each others' mistakes and triumphs.



You don't have to have your own experience of CC to come along - it's a great introduction to the tools and how they support free culture.
