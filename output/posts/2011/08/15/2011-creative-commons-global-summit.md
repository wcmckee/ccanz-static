Registration is now open for the 2011 Creative Commons Global Summit in Warsaw, Poland, 16-18 September.

<h2>The Conference</h2>

<em>From <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011" target="_self">Creative Commons ...</a></em>



For three days in September 2011, the Creative Commons Global Summit will bring together the CC community in Warsaw, Poland, to engage strategically on the future of our shared commons, to renew and further build CC’s vital community, to collaborate on mutual projects and initiatives, and to celebrate our successes as we head towards the end of our first decade together.



CC HQ and meeting host, CC Poland, are still working on preparing the final agenda for the meeting, but a <a title="Summit 2011 overview" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Summit_2011_overview" target="_self">preliminary program</a> is now available.



The Global Summit will bring together members of CC's <a title="CC Affiliate Network" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network" target="_self">Affiliate Network</a> worldwide, CC board and staff, key stakeholders and many others interested in the present and future of the commons. It will include regional meetings, plenary sessions, legal-focused sessions, community-focused sessions, workshops, regional planning sessions and special discussion sessions on key issues such as key adoption areas, data, public domain and the new version 4.0 licenses. The meeting will also include a "public day", featuring sessions of most interest to members of the public, including case study showcases, sessions on CC use in areas such as education, government and science, and a CC Salon featuring local and international CC creations.



In addition, CC’s <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/people/board" target="_self">Board of Directors</a> will have a board meeting in Warsaw and will be available to meet with Affiliates.

<h2>The Poster Competition</h2>

<em>From </em><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28608" target="_self"><em>Creative Commons ...</em></a>



Some of our CC affiliates in Asia are hosting a poster design competition for the summit, based on the theme, “Powering an Open Future.”



From the website:



<em>The Creative Commons Global Summit 2011 provides an opportunity for volunteers, industry leaders and practitioners of the worldwide open content licensing movement to explore and showcase the past, present and future of Creative Commons, copyright and free culture. It will be an event focused on sharing, openness and collaboration, with an eye towards setting the path for the Creative Commons community over its next 10 years.</em>



The winning designs (judged by an international panel and by popular vote) will be introduced at the Global Summit with people in attendance from all over the world, featured prominently at the venue and also as part of a CC visual arts exhibit. The designer will receive a gift of the printed poster from a professional publishing company in Warsaw.
