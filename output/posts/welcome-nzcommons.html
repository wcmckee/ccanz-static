<h5><strong>BY MATT MCGREGOR</strong></h5>
<p>Welcome to NZCommons, a site dedicated to opening New Zealand's culture and knowledge for sharing and reuse. Managed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</a>, NZCommons aims to be a busy community resource on the commons, with pieces ranging across government, data, education, copyright, heritage, research and the arts. We'll be adding additional categories as the site develops.</p>
<p>But why create a new site? While an increasing number of kiwis are sharing their work for reuse -- including schools, universities, musicians, museums and government departments -- we think it can be hard to find reliable commentary and advice on copyright and the commons.</p>
<p>We want NZCommons to be an information hub for the enormous number of New Zealanders, from librarians and teachers to artists and iwi groups, who are both excited and anxious about sharing their own work more openly and reusing content they find online.</p>
<p>At the moment, most of the content on NZCommons was written by or for Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ over the last four years -- but that will soon change. NZCommons is a community website, which means that its character will be largely determined by the people who volunteer to write for it. We've got dozens of people lined up to write for us over the next few months, from a variety of different fields.</p>
<p>At the same time, we're always on the lookout for more contributors. If you've got something to say about copyright, licensing and/or the commons in Aotearoa, then <a title="Contribute" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/contribute/">check out our contributors page</a> and get in touch.</p>
<p>You'll also note, between the articles, some particularly wonderful images. Most of these were sourced from <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/">Te Papa's great tranche</a> of out-of-copyright or CC licensed treasures, released a few weeks ago. We'll continue to plunder this and other great New Zealand open resources, including the <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">ever-growing resources at DigitalNZ</a>. If you see or make anything that needs showing off on our site, let us know.</p>
<p>We want the content on this website to travel, so unless we say otherwise, all the words on this website are licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>. You'll have to check the referencing for the images, which, like the wintery Wellington image below -- chosen because I'm writing from a particularly wintry Wellington morning -- is sourced from elsewhere.</p>
<p>Finally, we'd like to thanks our partners, <a href="https://internetnz.net.nz/" target="_blank">InternetNZ</a> and <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Land Information New Zealand</a>, who ensure that Creative Commons continues to flourish in Aotearoa New Zealand. We'd also like to thank <a href="http://prefer.co.nz/" target="_blank">Prefer</a>, for their in-kind support, and the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resource Foundation</a>, the new affiliate hosts of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
