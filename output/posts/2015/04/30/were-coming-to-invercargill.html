<p>On Friday 15 May, Matt is heading south to Invercargill. Thanks to SLANZA, we've managed to organise four back-to-back workshops on the day, which will all take place in the Invercargill Public Library Meeting Room.</p>
<p>If you're keen to attend any or all of these free workshops, please email Kirsty: kadam@jameshargest.school.nz</p>
<p></p>
<h4>9.30-10.30am: Creative Commons for the GLAM sector</h4>
<p>In 2014, both the National Library of New Zealand and Te Papa made significant commitments to release digitised collection items for reuse, under either a Creative Commons licence or a clear ‘no known rights’ statement. In this session, we’ll discuss the ins and outs of open access and open licensing for publicly-housed heritage collections, and talk about practical steps local institutions can take to make their collections more open.</p>
<h4>11-12pm: Creative Commons for research and tertiary education</h4>

<p>Around the world, tertiary education institutions are facing a crisis of affordability. On the one hand, the subscription costs for serials rose 402% between 1986 and 2011, a trend which led Harvard University to declare such increases “fiscally unsustainable.” On the other hand, the costs of student textbooks rose 812% from 1978-2012, increases which have had detrimental effects on both student debt and educational outcomes.</p>
<p>In this session, we’ll discuss how many institutions and funders are adopting policies on open access to research and open educational resources, to ensure that all publicly funded research outputs and educational resources are freely available to access and reuse.</p>
<h4>12.30-1.30pm: Creative Commons for schools</h4>

<p>Ever wondered how to share, adapt and reuse free and open educational resources online, without asking permission or breaking the law? Matt from Creative Commons will show you how.</p>
<p>After giving a quick introduction to copyright, Matt will discuss ins and outs of the free Creative Commons licences, and point to the adoption of a Creative Commons policy by over one hundred New Zealand schools. These policies make it legal for teachers to share resources owned by the Board of Trustees under a Creative Commons licence, so that they can be adapted and reused by others. Matt will also demonstrate how to search for more than 880 million works already available for free under a Creative Commons licence, including research, data, music, images and film.</p>
<h4>2-3pm: Creative Commons for Boards and School Leaders</h4>

<p>With the rise of new sharing portals, such as the Network for Learning’s Pond, more New Zealand teachers are going to be sharing teaching resources online. This is a great development. However, as teachers share more openly, schools will need to take greater care regarding their copyright policies, to ensure that teachers know exactly what they can and cannot do with works created during the course of their employment.</p>
<p>In this session, Matt from Creative Commons will provide an overview to copyright in schools, and show how over one hundred schools have used free Creative Commons licensing policies to provide greater certainty to teachers, school leaders and Boards of Trustees on the use and reuse of copyright works. Matt will also provide and walk through a template Creative Commons copyright policy, and discuss how a CC policy might be implemented with teaching staff.</p>
