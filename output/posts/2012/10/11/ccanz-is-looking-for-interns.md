<html><body><h3>Who are you looking for?</h3>

Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) is looking for two paid interns to help out over the university holidays.



The first intern will be a talented designer or visual artist, keen to produce a range of CCANZ resources, including an A2 poster.



The second intern will be a confident and engaging writer from either law, the humanities or related disciplines, willing to develop a Creative Commons research guide, write blog posts and conduct interviews for a range of Creative Commons case studies.



Both interns will be energetic supporters of open licensing and open culture, capable of working both collaboratively and independently. While all students are encouraged to apply, the successful candidates are likely to be entering their fourth or fifth years of study.

<h3>Where? When? And how much?<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cc.large_.png"><img class="wp-image-2249 alignright" title="cc.large" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cc.large_-300x300.png" alt="" width="160" height="160"></a></h3>

Interns will be paid $15 per hour. The amount of paid hours available will depend on the result of our November crowd-funding campaign. Candidates should note that, should the crowd-funding campaign fail, CCANZ will no longer be in a position to offer paid internships. We hope, however, to provide a total of at least 75 hours paid work. Interns will not be expected to work for free, though there may be opportunities to volunteer after the duration of the internship.



Ideally, the successful candidates will work between fifteen and twenty hours per week, between 8.30am and 3pm, at the Thorndon home of the Royal Society of New Zealand. Both interns will work under the direct supervision of the Public Lead for CCANZ. The internship will run from January 10 to February 15 2013, though specific details will not be determined until early December.



The successful candidates will be temporary employees of the Royal Society of New Zealand, which hosts the CCANZ project. Regrettably, CCANZ is unable to provide accommodation in Wellington, and candidates should note that their pay is unlikely to cover living costs in the Wellington area.
