<html><body><p>With Open Access Week (October 22-28) around the corner, there's plenty of events taking place across the country. With moves towards open access to scholarly publishing taking place in the UK, the EU, USA and Australia, it seems like a good time to start thinking about what open access will look like closer to home.



To this end, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is hosting a series of posts on the theme of Open Access. Featuring contributions from academics, publishers and librarians, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/open_access_2012/">Open Access in Aotearoa</a> will discuss the future of free and open access to New Zealand’s publicly funded scholarly research.



Several New Zealand universities are also hosting their own Open Access activities.
