<p>UNESCO Asia and the Pacific Regional Bureau for Education, Commonwealth of Learning and Thai Teachers TV recently held a <a href="http://oercongress.weebly.com/asia-pacific.html" target="_self">policy forum on Open Educational Resources</a> (OER). Creative Commons projects from this region <a href="http://wikieducator.org/CC_Asia_Pacific_OER" target="_self">showcased success</a> in the OER movement. Regional meetings lead up to the World OER Congress and the formation of a <a href="http://oercongress.weebly.com/paris-declaration.html" target="_self">Declaration</a> for governments to sign. The Congress will bring together Ministers of Education/Human Resource Development, senior policy makers, expert practitioners, researchers and relevant stakeholders to discuss what works and what won’t work, and to agree on a Declaration with a set of targets for a 2015 World Conference.</p>

<h3>OER In New Zealand</h3>
<p>The New Zealand Government has its own <a title="http://nzgoal.info" href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework</a> which provides guidance for agencies releasing data and content for reuse. The framework recommends CC BY as the default licence for this.</p>
<p>CC New Zealand collaborates with the Ministry of Education to provide professional development for teachers around New Zealand on Creative Commons and OER. We encourage and support schools to follow in the path of <a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School" target="_self">Albany Senior High School</a>, who have a CC intellectual property policy at their school, and utilize open source software.</p>
<p>The <a title="OERF" href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF" target="_self">Open Education Resource Foundation</a> has its base in Otago. <a title="Otago Polytechnic/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic/Home" target="_self">Otago Polytechnic</a> was the first institution in the world to adopt default CC-BY intellectual property policy, and five Kiwi institutions are founding anchor partners of the <a title="OER university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" target="_self">OERu initiative</a>.</p>
<h3>OER in Australia</h3>

<p>The University of Southern Queensland (USQ) is a strong provider of distance education programs, with 75% of its students studying by distance education. <a title="http://ocw.usq.edu.au" href="http://ocw.usq.edu.au/" target="_self">USQ’s OpenCourseWare (OCW)</a> portal makes 10 courses available under a CC BY-NC-SA license.</p>

It is led by the University of Tasmania and funded by the</p>
<p>Australian Learning and Teaching Council Ltd (ALTC) – now Office of Learning and Teaching (OLT)).</p>
<h3>OER in South Korea</h3>

<p><a title="http://www.snow.or.kr" href="http://www.snow.or.kr/" target="_self">SNOW</a> “Sookmyung Network for Open World” is a community type OER platform that delivers remarkable courseware around the world to a Korean speaking audience. Users can upload OER content to share, discuss with comments, and translate into Korean</p>
<p><a title="http://ocw.korea.edu" href="http://ocw.korea.edu/" target="_self">Korea University’s OCW</a> is the official Open CourseWare site for Korea University and makes course materials available through CC licensing. It holds more than 270 classes, provided by professors who believe in sharing and opening up their resources.</p>

<p><a title="http://egoing.net/" href="http://egoing.net/" target="_self">Egoing</a> is a independent blogger who is voluntarily uploading online tutorials.
