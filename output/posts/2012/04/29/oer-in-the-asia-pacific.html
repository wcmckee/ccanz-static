<p>UNESCO Asia and the Pacific Regional Bureau for Education, Commonwealth of Learning and Thai Teachers TV recently held a <a href="http://oercongress.weebly.com/asia-pacific.html" target="_self">policy forum on Open Educational Resources</a> (OER). Creative Commons projects from this region <a href="http://wikieducator.org/CC_Asia_Pacific_OER" target="_self">showcased success</a> in the OER movement. Regional meetings lead up to the World OER Congress and the formation of a <a href="http://oercongress.weebly.com/paris-declaration.html" target="_self">Declaration</a> for governments to sign. The Congress will bring together Ministers of Education/Human Resource Development, senior policy makers, expert practitioners, researchers and relevant stakeholders to discuss what works and what won’t work, and to agree on a Declaration with a set of targets for a 2015 World Conference.</p>

<h3>OER In New Zealand</h3>
<p>The New Zealand Government has its own <a title="http://nzgoal.info" href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework</a> which provides guidance for agencies releasing data and content for reuse. The framework recommends CC BY as the default licence for this.</p>
<p>CC New Zealand collaborates with the Ministry of Education to provide professional development for teachers around New Zealand on Creative Commons and OER. We encourage and support schools to follow in the path of <a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School" target="_self">Albany Senior High School</a>, who have a CC intellectual property policy at their school, and utilize open source software.</p>
<p>The <a title="OERF" href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF" target="_self">Open Education Resource Foundation</a> has its base in Otago. <a title="Otago Polytechnic/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic/Home" target="_self">Otago Polytechnic</a> was the first institution in the world to adopt default CC-BY intellectual property policy, and five Kiwi institutions are founding anchor partners of the <a title="OER university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" target="_self">OERu initiative</a>.</p>
