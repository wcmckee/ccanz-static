<html><body><p>The <a href="http://www.cckorea.org/xe/?mid=english" target="_self">Creative Commons Korea</a> project has released an attractive new content search tool - making it easy to source Creative Commons licensed materials.



The "<a href="http://eng.letscc.net/" target="_self">Let's CC</a>" website brings you relevant results from pools such as Flickr, Foopedia, Clipart, Freesound, Slideshare and more. Simply type in a search term and filter for how many freedoms the copyright owner has granted you with their Creative Commons licence.



"Let's CC" was originally created for a Korean audience, so we're thrilled that Kiwi's can enjoy it in its English language version. Other CC content searches can be made through global CC's own <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_self">search interface</a> and through <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_self">DigitalNZ</a> for New Zealand results.</p></body></html>
