That's right: <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons is turning ten</a>! The Creative Commons licence suite--which has spread to over seventy countries and has been applied to over 500 million objects--was first launched on 16 December 2002.



To celebrate, affiliates from around the world are hosting events, and Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is no different. In collaboration with the New Zealand Film Archive, we're screening <a href="http://ripremix.com/" target="_blank">RIP: A Remix Manifesto</a>, a film which fittingly features Creative Commons co-founder <a href="http://10.creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Lawrence Lessig</a> and prominent remix artists like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Talk_%28musician%29" target="_blank">Girl Talk</a>.



To cover costs, we're charging $8 at the door. Feel free to come down and catch up with other Creative Commoners from around the region.
