The drive for ‘open’ in tertiary education—be it ‘open education,’ ‘open research’ or ‘open access’—is quickly gaining steam. In May, the academic senate of the University of California San Francisco joined Harvard and MIT to announce that all current and future research would be made available to the public. In December 2011, the British government made a commitment to provide open access to publicly funded data.



At the same time, academics are experiencing tensions between the drive to make publicly funded research openly available and the need to publish in ‘prestige’ journals. International movements such as Open Educational Resources (OER) are helping to guide teachers and researchers through these murky waters.  These movements are also working to lower the cost of producing educational resources, in order to supply them online to educators, for free.



How can twenty-first century researchers and tertiary education providers navigate their rights and responsibilities in regards to their work? How do we help realise ‘Open Research’ and its relationship to ‘Open Government’? What are our expectations for ‘Open Education’?



Join us for an evening of information and discussion on the Open Research and OER Movements in tertiary education.



Speakers will include:



-          Dr Fabiana Kubke, Senior Lecturer, School of Medical Sciences, University of Auckland



-          Professor Anne Fitzgerald, Queensland University of Technology Law Faculty and Creative Commons Australia



-          Dr Wayne Mackintosh, Director Open Education Resource Foundation and Commonwealth of Learning Chair in OER, Otago Polytechnic
