<html><body><p>Last month, we announced at the National Digital Forum and Nethui South that we, in partnership with DigitalNZ, would be running <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/">Mix &amp; Mash 2013: The New Storytelling.</a> We're extremely pleased that <a href="http://www.orcon.net.nz/">Orcon</a> is sponsoring our first issue, and that <a href="http://www.squiz.co.nz/">Squiz</a> is sponsoring the Supreme Winner. We'll announce other sponsors over the next few weeks.



This is going to be a major initiative for Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, as more and more schools start to adopt Creative Commons policies for their teaching materials. We especially want to:

</p><ul>

	<li>demonstrate the range and value of New Zealand openly licensed and public domain materials;</li>

	<li>increase the profile of Creative Commons licensed materials, including open educational resources and Creative Commons policies, in New Zealand schools; and,</li>

	<li>educate New Zealand students on copyright, licensing and reuse.</li>

</ul>

Sounds good, doesn't it? Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand was a proud sponsor of earlier versions of the competition, but this year we're especially excited to be sitting front and centre.



So, how's it going to work? And how's it different from <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2010-winners/" target="_blank">the Mixes and Mashes of earlier years</a>?



First of all, this is going to be less a one-off 'competition' than an ongoing showcase: we really want to show off the creative work of kiwi students and the public. This means that there'll be three deadlines--in May, August and November--equating to three main 'issues' of student work, which means in turn that there'll be plenty of opportunities for students to share their work with the global Creative Commons community.



But we also want to show off the amazing range of public domain and Creative Commons materials <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">accessible through DigitalNZ</a>, so we're also going to highlight some of those materials for students to adapt, remix &amp; reuse.



We're also cutting down on the categories, to keep everything nice and simple!



And what will entries look like? Well, we don't really know--we want New Zealand's young people, as well members of the public, to show <em>us</em> what new storytelling looks like--but we have an idea. It could be a familiar form, such as a poem or a short-story; it could include video, music, animation, painting or comics; it could be something utterly surprising, something we never expected.



But, since you asked, here are some examples:

<ul>

	<li>In 2010, Jem Yoshioka won the ‘ Mix and Mash Supreme Creative Remix’ with ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2010-winners/supreme-remix">An Opal Dream Cave,</a>’ her reinvention of Katherine Mansfield’s poem ‘The Opal Dream Cave’ and a variety of public domain materials.</li>

	<li>In 2011, Alan Zia won the ‘Mix and Mash Literature Remix’ with ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/literature-remix/">Crossed Cultures,</a>’ his remix of Renee Liang’s ‘Crossed Cultures’ and Dylan Horrocks ‘Siso.’</li>

	<li>In 2011, Candy Elsemore won the ‘Mix and Mash Supreme Creative Remix’ with ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/supreme-creative-remix/">A Grand Mother</a>,’ a digital story which made use of a variety of openly licensed archival materials.</li>

	<li>In 2011, Rita Godlevskis won the ‘ Mix and Mash Digital Story’ category for ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/digital-story/">New Zealand,</a>’ which also made used of a variety of public domain materials from New Zealand libraries and archives.</li>

</ul>

I'm a sucker for anything that makes me cry."
