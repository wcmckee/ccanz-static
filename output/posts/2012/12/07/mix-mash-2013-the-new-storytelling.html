<p>Last month, we announced at the National Digital Forum and Nethui South that we, in partnership with DigitalNZ, would be running <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/">Mix &amp; Mash 2013: The New Storytelling.</a> We're extremely pleased that <a href="http://www.orcon.net.nz/">Orcon</a> is sponsoring our first issue, and that <a href="http://www.squiz.co.nz/">Squiz</a> is sponsoring the Supreme Winner. We'll announce other sponsors over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>This is going to be a major initiative for Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, as more and more schools start to adopt Creative Commons policies for their teaching materials. We especially want to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>demonstrate the range and value of New Zealand openly licensed and public domain materials;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>increase the profile of Creative Commons licensed materials, including open educational resources and Creative Commons policies, in New Zealand schools; and,<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>educate New Zealand students on copyright, licensing and reuse.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre>




<p>Sounds good, doesn't it? Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand was a proud sponsor of earlier versions of the competition, but this year we're especially excited to be sitting front and centre.</p>
<p>So, how's it going to work? And how's it different from <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2010-winners/" target="_blank">the Mixes and Mashes of earlier years</a>?</p>
<p>First of all, this is going to be less a one-off 'competition' than an ongoing showcase: we really want to show off the creative work of kiwi students and the public. This means that there'll be three deadlines--in May, August and November--equating to three main 'issues' of student work, which means in turn that there'll be plenty of opportunities for students to share their work with the global Creative Commons community.</p>
<p>But we also want to show off the amazing range of public domain and Creative Commons materials <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">accessible through DigitalNZ</a>, so we're also going to highlight some of those materials for students to adapt, remix &amp; reuse.</p>
<p>We're also cutting down on the categories, to keep everything nice and simple!</p>
<p>And what will entries look like? Well, we don't really know--we want New Zealand's young people, as well members of the public, to show <em>us</em> what new storytelling looks like--but we have an idea. It could be a familiar form, such as a poem or a short-story; it could include video, music, animation, painting or comics; it could be something utterly surprising, something we never expected.</p>
<p>But, since you asked, here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2010, Jem Yoshioka won the ‘ Mix and Mash Supreme Creative Remix’ with ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2010-winners/supreme-remix">An Opal Dream Cave,</a>’ her reinvention of Katherine Mansfield’s poem ‘The Opal Dream Cave’ and a variety of public domain materials.</li>

    <li>In 2011, Alan Zia won the ‘Mix and Mash Literature Remix’ with ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/literature-remix/">Crossed Cultures,</a>’ his remix of Renee Liang’s ‘Crossed Cultures’ and Dylan Horrocks ‘Siso.’</li>

    <li>In 2011, Candy Elsemore won the ‘Mix and Mash Supreme Creative Remix’ with ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/supreme-creative-remix/">A Grand Mother</a>,’ a digital story which made use of a variety of openly licensed archival materials.</li>

    <li>In 2011, Rita Godlevskis won the ‘ Mix and Mash Digital Story’ category for ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/digital-story/">New Zealand,</a>’ which also made used of a variety of public domain materials from New Zealand libraries and archives.</li>

</ul>

I'm a sucker for anything that makes me cry."</p>
