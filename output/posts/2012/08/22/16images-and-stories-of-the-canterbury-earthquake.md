<html><body><p>After the earthquake in Canterbury, several New Zealand government agencies – following the <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_blank">NZGOAL</a> framework – released their photos, videos and data under a Creative Commons licence.



At the time, this meant that the public could post, reuse and share the latest information about the extent of the disaster. In 2012, these resources constitute an extraordinary – and extraordinarily open – archive. Here are a few examples:



Land Information New Zealand <a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/3185-christchurch-post-earthquake-aerial-photos-24-feb-2011/?embed=1" target="_blank">released their aerial photography on the Koordinates platform</a>, which is still their most popular download.

As we reported <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2011/04/post-quake-imagery-of-christchurch-carries-cc-licence/" target="_blank"> at the time</a>, Civil Defence also released footage of inner-city Christchurch under an open Creative Commons licence.

After the earthquake, public institutions like the Christchurch City Library, the National Library of New Zealand and Canterbury University formed the <a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/" target="_blank">CEISMIC Consortium</a> and began to call for people who experienced the earthquake to share their stories and photos online.



They developed several websites, including <a href="http://www.quakestories.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Quake Stories</a> and a section of <a href="http://http://ketechristchurch.peoplesnetworknz.info/canterbury_earthquakes_2010_2011" target="_blank">Kete Christchurch</a>. Most of the stories and photos on these sites have been given a Creative Commons 3.0 New Zealand licence, to make sure the public has advance permission to share and reuse the works.



Most recently, the plan for the <a href="http://ccdu.govt.nz/the-plan" target="_blank">Christchurch Recover Plan</a> was published with a Creative Commons Attribution licence.
