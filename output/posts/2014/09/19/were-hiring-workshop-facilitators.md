<html><body><p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is looking for casual workshop facilitators based in Auckland, Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin.



Creative Commons is helping to roll out open policy to every school, research and heritage institution in New Zealand -- but to do this, we’re going to need some help.



We’re looking for confident, articulate candidates who can commit to providing one to two workshops per month. Successful candidates will be paid a standard rate of $100 per workshop provided, though should note that this work is very casual, and will depend on local demand.



These positions won’t pay the rent, but they're a great opportunity to help grow the Commons in Aotearoa New Zealand.



Candidates should have their own form of transport, or be able to get around their home city to local schools, research and heritage institutions.



We’ll provide some training and all the materials you’ll need, though a working knowledge of copyright and Creative Commons is desirable. You should also have some public speaking experience.



We’re also building a pool of (unfortunately unpaid) volunteers who can commit to providing a workshop or writing for our community site, NZCommons.org.nz, every two or three months. If you’re keen to volunteer, let us know on your application.



Please send us a short CV and a quick cover letter outlining your interest in helping out CC.



We’re looking for facilitators based in Auckland, Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin. Applicants based in other regions are welcome to apply, though should note there is unlikely to be much work available outside of the main centres.



Applications close 8 October 2014.</p></body></html>
