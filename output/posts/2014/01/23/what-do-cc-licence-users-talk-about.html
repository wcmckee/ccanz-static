<p>[<em>For the first few weeks of 2014, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been joined by three talented interns, Hannah Mettner, Conal Thompson and Sun Jeong. They're making new Creative Commons resources, writing case studies, editing our upcoming CC book and researching the use of CC licensing in the cultural sector. Hannah, a writer and editor, has been reading and editing the 40+ case studies of New Zealand CC licence users. Here are some of her reflections]</em></p>

<h5>By Hannah Mettner</h5>
<p>For the last week, I’ve been going through<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/case-studies/" target="_blank"> the case studies</a> we’ve collected over the years as individuals and organisations have begun to use Creative Commons licences, and I’ve noticed a few trends. Here they are…</p>
<h5><em>1. People love using CC</em></h5>

<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Attribution.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5085" alt="Attribution" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Attribution.jpg" width="190" height="190"></a>It really does seem that once people use/experience CC they love it. There’s a growing attitude of generosity around information, and to me, more interestingly, creativity. A lot of people are saying stuff like “it works fantastically for us”, and that they’re “inclined to start from a default position of ‘everything should be open’”. Just imagine!</p>
<h5><em>2. CC helps increase visibility and reuse</em></h5>

<p>Organisations are noticing a massive increase in visibility and usage upon making data available online with CC licence. Some report user numbers increasing by 1000% in a single year.</p>
<h5><em>3. CC saves time</em></h5>

<p>Another commonality is that having information CC licensed online frees up time for employees. Rather than having to manually address requests for information every time they’re received, they could focus on other things. AND because they don’t have to spend time preparing the information, they don’t need to charge for it.</p>
<h5><em>4. CC can help artists commercially</em></h5>

<p>Artists using CC licensing have initially begun doing so for the social-creative implications; it’s exciting for them to have others experience and reuse their work. But wider exposure can mean increased commercial gain as an added benefit. Some artists are posting work to the internet during its creation and making the final piece available for purchase. Some have non-commercial licences but have had work picked up and paid for by big-name companies.  And many of them are remixing and reusing and being inspired by one another!</p>
