<h5>By Conal Thompson</h5>
<p>It is a common misconception that copyright in a work needs to be registered in order to be recognised. The truth is that in New Zealand copyright exists as soon as a work is created, and whether or not copyright does exist in a work is determined by a set of rules established by the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345634.html" target="_blank">Copyright Act 1994.</a></p>
<p>The distinct lack of formalities required by copyright law has increasingly become an issue with the rise (to use a favourite term of journalists and academics) of the “scary internet machine-monster” (okay, I made that one up).</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Monster-Soup.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5147 " alt="V0011218 An woman dropping her tea-cup in horror u" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Monster-Soup.jpg" width="321" height="218"></a> Not a scary internet machine-monster, but close enough. "<a href="http://www.wellcomecollection.org/explore/sickness--health/topics/epidemics/images.aspx?view=a-monster-soup" target="_blank">Monster Soup commonly called Thames Water</a>" by William Heath, London, 1828, via Wellcome Library / Wellcome Images. Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales License .</p>
<p>What's the issue? Take, for instance, a picture that I draw of the “scary internet machine-monster” that I then publish online. From the second that I publish it, copyright exists in that drawing, which is owned by me.</p>
<p>This is regardless of whether or not I put my name to it, place a little ©-symbol next to it, or provide any details that can easily trace the drawing back to its creator (me).</p>
<p>Let's say I chose not to do any of those things when I published it. This is what many people do (or to put it better, don’t do) when they publish their work online. Such a work is known as an “orphan work” – meaning the owner of copyright is difficult to find or untraceable.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that if my picture became really popular and other people wanted to use it, the lack of information I provide with the picture makes it difficult for those people to contact me and gain my permission to use it.</p>
<p>This won’t prevent the spread of the picture onto other websites that make no money from it – but what if a big-shot clothing manufacturer decided they wanted to pay me to put my drawing onto t-shirts that they sell? Unfortunately for me, that lucrative deal won’t be making its way into my bank account, because I didn’t provide details of who owns the copyright, and the spread of the picture onto a multitude of other websites would have made it virtually impossible for the manufacturer to track down its origin.</p>
<p>If I applied a Creative Commons license to it, however, then it would make it a lot easier for other users to trace its ownership back to me. Say that I wanted my drawing to be able to be shared and easily attributable back to me – I would add a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC licence </a>to it, so that others could use it but not make any money from it.</p>
<p>This means I still have the exclusive right to commercially benefit from it, meaning that big-shot clothing manufacturer can still come knocking at my door and I can still earn reward for my work – most of all because this time around, they know where to find me.</p>
<p>Note: In 2013, the Berkeley School of Law hosted a symposium on this very issue, called “<a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/formalities.htm" target="_blank">Reform(aliz)ing Copyright for the Internet Age</a>”. If you’re interested in the legal and political debate surrounding the establishment of formalities for copyright law then head over there and take a look.</p>
