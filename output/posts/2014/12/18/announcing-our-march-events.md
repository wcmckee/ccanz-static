<html><body><p>In March 2015, we're holding (at least) 18 events across the country, focusing on schools and GLAM (that's galleries, libraries, archives and museums).



These events will be a chance to discuss how Creative Commons is being used across New Zealand's school and GLAM sectors. Our schools and GLAM organisations make and look after an extraordinary amount of high-quality works, and we think that there are massive social, cultural and economic benefits to sharing this work more openly.



Currently, we have events planned Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Hawkes Bay, New Plymouth, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Wellington, Nelson, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Westport. But we're keen to do even more! If you want CC to come to your organisation or region, and can help us find a venue and an audience, we'll be sure to come.



If you're keen to attend any of these events, please fill out the form below! There are more details regarding times, dates, venues and speakers on <a title="Creative Commons Roadtrip – GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/">GLAM events here</a> and on <a title="Creative Commons Roadtrip – Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/">schools events here</a>.



A big thanks to our partners, Land Information New Zealand and InternetNZ, for enabling us to hold these events. Also, a big thanks to LIANZA and Te Papa for partnering with us on the GLAM events.
