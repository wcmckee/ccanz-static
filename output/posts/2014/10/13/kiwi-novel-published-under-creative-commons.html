<p>Author <a title="Thom Sleigh" href="https://twitter.com/TSleigher" target="_blank">Thomasin Sleigh</a> has published her debut novel, <a title="Ad Lib" href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz/p/ad-lib-by-thomasin-sleigh.html" target="_blank"><i>Ad Lib</i></a>, under Creative Commons <a title="CC licence" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">BY-NC-SA</a> 4.0 licence, with the publishing collective <a title="Lawrence &amp; Gibson publishers" href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz/" target="_blank">Lawrence and Gibson</a>.</p>
<p>Thomasin’s work at Digital NZ to open up Aotearoa’s cultural treasures for sharing and reuse has informed her decision to license her own work under CC. “Publishing <i>Ad Lib</i> under a Creative Commons licence was very much an ideological decision. I am an advocate for unlocking cultural resources and, even though my book is published in paper format at the moment, and so is relatively difficult to copy compared to an ebook, I wanted to contribute to the creative commons.”</p>
<p>Thomasin has chosen a licence that gives people advance permission to use her work in their own creations, as long as they attribute her and don’t make money from it. “Because I don’t write fiction for a living, I have the freedom to release my work in a way that might be more difficult for professional novelists.” She is also concerned with future-proofing. “The media landscape is only going to change, and keep changing ever more rapidly. I don’t want there to be any confusion in the future about how my work is to be treated.” Fundamentally, Thomasin sees potential reuse as a compliment, not a threat: “if anyone wanted to use or copy from <i>Ad Lib</i>, I would be genuinely flattered.”</p>
<p>Publishing a paper book under a CC licence is relatively unusual, and Thomasin was lucky to be published by Lawrence and Gibson, a Wellington-based publishing collective that is open to new and experimental ways of doing things. The cover for <i>Ad Lib</i> was designed by Berlin-based illustrator <a title="Judith Carnaby" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/AD-LIB" target="_blank">Judith Carnaby</a>, who licenses her work under CC BY-SA.</p>

<p>The printing for <i>Ad Lib</i> was done by hand at <a title="Rebel Press" href="http://www.rebelpress.org.nz/about" target="_blank">Rebel Press</a>, an anarchist publishing collective that also offers printing services. Thomasin says that the print irregularities resulting from this handmade process are “love letters from me to the reader”.</p>

<p>If <i>Ad Lib</i> were to be published as an ebook in the future, Thomasin says she would definitely license it BY-NC-SA as well. As well as opening up her own work, Thomasin’s licensing decision has exposed publishers at Lawrence and Gibson to the possibilities of book publishing with Creative Commons, so watch this space.</p>
<p><i>Thomasin is the Community Manager at <a title="Digital NZ" href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">Digital NZ</a></i><i>, a search and data service, which seeks to make Aotearoa's digital treasures easy to find, share, and use. On the international stage, Thomasin is a member of the <a title="OpenGLAM" href="http://openglam.org/working-group/" target="_blank">OpenGLAM Working Group</a></i><i>, a global network of people who work to open up cultural data and content in the GLAM sector (galleries, libraries, archives and museums). Thomasin has an MA in art history and a background in writing contemporary art criticism.</i></p>
