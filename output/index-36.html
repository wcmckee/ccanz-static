<h5>Let's Sprint!</h5>

<p>Earlier this week, we announced our plans to organise <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz/sprints" target="_blank">the Great 2016 Open Educational Resource Sprints</a>.</p>
<p>As I said in my post last week, we’re getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies, which are enabling teachers to legally share and collaborate. This is good news, of course, but the risk is that the policy becomes just a piece of paper, to which no one really pays all that much attention.</p>
<p>It’s our opinion at CCANZ that it’s about time we put these policies into practice, and show how kiwi teachers can work together to make new, open resources.</p>
<p>Hence, the Sprints. But when you announce a new idea like an OER Sprint, you quickly find people asking a few quite important questions.</p>
<h5>What's a Sprint, Anyway?</h5>

<p>Let’s begin with the first one. What’s a sprint?</p>
<p>A resource sprint is an idea borrowed from the technology sector, where it is sometimes called a ‘hack.’ <a href="https://www.govhack.org.nz" target="_blank">The ‘GovHack’ weekends</a> are one example of technologists, designers and a range of other volunteers coming together to make new products and services from open government data and information.</p>
<p>In the education sector, one of the big examples that inspired us was the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/02/announcing-the-creative-commons-media-studies-textbook/" target="_blank">Media Text Hack</a> (there’s that word again), where a team of educators and researchers got together to write an open Media Studies textbook. It’s now an assigned undergraduate textbook at the University of Otago.</p>
<p>The other example - which itself inspired the Media Text Hack team - was the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oppikirjamaraton">Oppikirjamaraton</a> (that’s Finnish for ‘textbook marathon). This event involved about thirty Finnish mathematics educators writing a new textbook for schools.</p>
<p>Both of these events give us working models of how an OER Sprint might work. Both organising teams have also been open about the problems they had during the event (such as technology - surprise, surprise) and what they would do differently.</p>
<h5>Decisions, Decisions</h5>

<p>Despite these fantastic examples, there’s still a heap of details about the event that we need to figure out. We’ve decided to open up the process early, so everyone can see how our decisions are being made. Hopefully, at the end, we have a model that schools, associations and informal groups of teachers can use to sprint - or hack - their way to the resources they need.</p>
<p>So, what do we need to think about? I’ll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at NZCommons <a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/23k8VZ9w/oer-sprints" target="_blank">and in our open Loomio group</a>, with other volunteer organisers. But here's a few to get us started.</p>
<ul>
<li>How long should it last for? Some sprints last for two days, others just one. Some sprints keep strict, family-friendly time-frames, while others keep working deep into the night. My feeling is that we ought to keep it short and sweet - i.e a busy 9/10-5 - for either one or two days, though with an expectation than many participants won’t be able to commit for the full period.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Technology - the bane of many such events. We’ll need to find a technical platform that works for everyone. My initial thinking is that Google Docs will work fine for small teams, and is a technology many teachers already use. Some bigger projects with many more collaborators  have had issues with using Google Docs, and more technical platforms - like Github - have also been problematic.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Participants, volunteers and facilitators. What skills do we need? And what’s the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts (like academics), facilitators and other volunteers? My feeling is that we need to keep the focus of the event as ‘by teachers, for teachers’, with other volunteers serving to support the needs of the participants teachers. At the same time, we want to take advantage of the collective expertise of everyone who wants to help out.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>What’s a ‘resource’? Other sprints have focused on making single book (or book-like entity). My feeling is that a ‘resource’ is whatever the heck participants decide to make on the day, and that this should be the decision of each individual team.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Team formation: what constitutes a team? How many people? 3-6 seems about right, though I'm not sure about this.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>What about virtual participation? If we’re working on Google docs, this is fine - though virtual collaboration can breed those dreaded Technological Problems, which we’ll want to avoid. But we shouldn’t put any barriers on people participating, either.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>What will the events actually look like? My assumption is that it will involve people sitting at tables, talking and typing. We should try to minimise the amount of scene-setting at the beginning, and look to have a plethora of helpers to solve problems as they arise. This will involve giving clear guidance beforehand. A minor amount of faffing about at the beginning is probably unavoidable.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>How much does it cost? From our point of view, there are two sorts of costs: event costs; and outreach costs, before and after the event. For the event, we’ll need funding or in-kind sponsorship to cover food, drink, venue, technology and other incidental costs. For the outreach, we’ll need funding to get resources on CC and OER to as many teachers as possible.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally, how many events? We’re not sure, yet, though before the end of the year, we should make some initial committments. I’m obviously keen to have them anywhere and everywhere, though this will depend on us getting strong local support.</li>

</ul>

<p>Next year, we're going to help organise a series of <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/sprints/" target="_blank">Open Educational Resources Sprints</a>.</p>
<p>A OER sprint - known as a hack weekend in the technology community - is where a group of enthusiastic volunteers get together to make new open educational resources in a short period of time (that's the 'sprint' part).</p>
<p>The resources are then made available to everyone, for free, under an open Creative Commons licence, allowing others to copy, adapt and reuse (that's the 'open' part).</p>
<p>This isn't a new idea. One inspiring project was <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34643" target="_blank">the Oppikirjamaraton</a>, in which a group of thirty maths teachers wrote a new high school textbook <em>in five hours.</em></p>
<p>Closer to home, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/02/announcing-the-creative-commons-media-studies-textbook/" target="_blank">the Media Text Hack</a> saw a group of educators create a free and open Media Studies undergraduate textbook in a weekend (now an assigned textbook at the University of Otago).</p>
<p>So, which resources will be made? That's entirely up to the teams that take part. We've already contacted the associations for English, Digital Technologies and Science teachers, and other associations are welcome to jump on board.</p>
<p>If you're keen to get involved, fill out the form, below, and we'll keep you in the loop. You can also join our Loomio group, where we'll be doing most of the organising.</p>

<h5>BY MATT MCGREGOR</h5>
<h5>CC Policies for All!</h5>

<p>For a few years now, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/about/who-we-are/">we at CCANZ</a> - that’s Elizabeth and me and a broad community of volunteers - have been working on a sprawlingly ambitious project that has since become known as ‘CC in Schools.’</p>
<p>To date, the main part of <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools/" target="_blank">CC in Schools</a> has been advocating for individual schools to pass Creative Commons policies. These policies, approved at a Board of Trustees level, simply give permission for teachers to share their resources using a CC licence. We’ve written about this a tonne--including in just about every teaching publication in the country--so I won’t go into it now.</p>
<p>We’re pretty happy with the progress. We’ve got around 100 schools on board - and probably quite a few more that haven’t got in touch with us - including some of the largest schools in the country, such as Hutt Valley High School, Burnside High School and Middleton Grange. We’re going to continue to beaver away, and are working at partnering more formally with some of the bigger educational fish in Aotearoa, to help scale this work to every other school in the country.</p>
<h5>So We Have This CC Policy...</h5>

<p>But the point of these CC policies was never just to have some nice-sounding pieces of paper in various school policy packs. CC in Schools was (and is) motivated by a desire to: a) make it less risky for teachers to share their work; and b) grow a commons of open educational resources. This will save time and money and ensure that the best resources in the country are available to anyone who wants them, free of technical, price and legal restrictions on reuse.</p>
<p>In advocating for these policies, we’ve faced one basic hurdle - and, by the way, this hurdle is categorically not that schools and teachers don’t want to share their work.</p>
<p>It’s a hurdle that’s best summed up by a lovely cartoon that Jessica Coates, from our mates at CC Australia, likes to use in her presentations. It’s something that all of us (except, perhaps, for IP lawyers) can sympathise with:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copyright-Law.jpg"><img class="wp-image-753 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copyright-Law.jpg" alt="Copyright Law" width="532" height="407"></a> Slide 12 from "<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Jessicacoates/open-access-glam-34793864">Open Access GLAM</a>" by Jessica Coates. Made available under a <a href="http://Slide%2012%20from%20%22Open%20Access%20GLAM%22%20by%20Jessica%20Coates.%20Made%20available%20under%20a%20CC%20BY%203.0%20unported%20licence.">CC BY 3.0 unported licence</a>.</p>
<h5>Do I Really Have To Think About Copyright?</h5>

<p>So, here’s the hurdle: most people just don’t want to spend their time thinking about copyright. Those who dip their toes into the copyright waters tend to find out pretty quickly that copyright isn’t intuitive; it isn’t common sense: and it doesn’t work in the way that many people would like. They also find that some parts of copyright -- like permitted uses for educators -- can get quite complex, and they generally have a hard time getting straight answers (sometimes because those straight answers simply don’t exist).</p>
<p>Copyright discussions also have a habit of becoming overly moralistic (‘stealing’, ‘ripping off’), technical (‘see section 21.2 of the 1994 Copyright Act’) or otherwise devolving into a lecture (‘In 1709, the Statute of Anne...’).</p>
<p>Some of this is unavoidable. Copyright isn’t going away, and unless New Zealand decides to adopt more liberal and broad fair use exceptions in our upcoming review, some of the complexity isn’t going to go away, either.</p>
<h5>Spend Less Time Thinking about Copyright</h5>

<p>But some of it really is avoidable. A big part of the problem with copyright and educational resources in New Zealand is that creators effectively outsource thinking about copyright to the end user. Even when works are made to be freely shared and adapted - like many educational resources - the user has the burden of figuring out whether their use is legal. They may choose not to use the work at all; they may use it, and risk breaking the law.</p>
<p>This is why we need more creators to use CC. It brings me back to one of the goals of CC in Schools (worth keeping in mind with policies like this): to grow a commons of educational resources where <em>the end user doesn’t need to think about copyright</em>. All they need to is follow the human-readable licence terms.</p>
<p>Using CC licences can reduce the amount of time teachers (and others) spend thinking about copyright, and also reduce any legal risks, by ensuring that the people using your resources know exactly what they can (and cannot) do.</p>
<p>This is obviously a challenge. While large sharing portals are making it easier than ever to add a licence, it can seem like One More Thing. But remember: by adding a licence, you’re ensuring that others, further down the line, can spend less time thinking about copyright. And that, I think, is something we (and maybe even lawyers) can all get behind.</p>
