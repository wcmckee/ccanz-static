<p>Author <a title="Thom Sleigh" href="https://twitter.com/TSleigher" target="_blank">Thomasin Sleigh</a> has published her debut novel, <a title="Ad Lib" href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz/p/ad-lib-by-thomasin-sleigh.html" target="_blank"><i>Ad Lib</i></a>, under Creative Commons <a title="CC licence" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">BY-NC-SA</a> 4.0 licence, with the publishing collective <a title="Lawrence &amp; Gibson publishers" href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz/" target="_blank">Lawrence and Gibson</a>.</p>
<p>Thomasin’s work at Digital NZ to open up Aotearoa’s cultural treasures for sharing and reuse has informed her decision to license her own work under CC. “Publishing <i>Ad Lib</i> under a Creative Commons licence was very much an ideological decision. I am an advocate for unlocking cultural resources and, even though my book is published in paper format at the moment, and so is relatively difficult to copy compared to an ebook, I wanted to contribute to the creative commons.”</p>
<p>Thomasin has chosen a licence that gives people advance permission to use her work in their own creations, as long as they attribute her and don’t make money from it. “Because I don’t write fiction for a living, I have the freedom to release my work in a way that might be more difficult for professional novelists.” She is also concerned with future-proofing. “The media landscape is only going to change, and keep changing ever more rapidly. I don’t want there to be any confusion in the future about how my work is to be treated.” Fundamentally, Thomasin sees potential reuse as a compliment, not a threat: “if anyone wanted to use or copy from <i>Ad Lib</i>, I would be genuinely flattered.”</p>
<p>Publishing a paper book under a CC licence is relatively unusual, and Thomasin was lucky to be published by Lawrence and Gibson, a Wellington-based publishing collective that is open to new and experimental ways of doing things. The cover for <i>Ad Lib</i> was designed by Berlin-based illustrator <a title="Judith Carnaby" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/AD-LIB" target="_blank">Judith Carnaby</a>, who licenses her work under CC BY-SA.</p>

<p>The printing for <i>Ad Lib</i> was done by hand at <a title="Rebel Press" href="http://www.rebelpress.org.nz/about" target="_blank">Rebel Press</a>, an anarchist publishing collective that also offers printing services. Thomasin says that the print irregularities resulting from this handmade process are “love letters from me to the reader”.</p>

<a href="posts/2014/10/09/lincoln-universitys-open-access-policy.html" class="u-url">Lincoln University's Open Access Policy</a>
             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2014-10-09T12:20:41+13:00">2014-10-09 12:20</time>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p></p>
<p>In July 2013, Lincoln University passed <a href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/About/Policies/Open-Access-Policy/" target="_blank">a wide-ranging Open Access policy</a>, becoming the first New Zealand university to do so. Coverage includes research outputs including data, teaching materials and the University’s business records.</p>
<p>The policy states that “as an organisation Lincoln University has a policy position which endorses making content openly and freely available as the first and preferred option.” It goes on to state that "Lincoln University takes a broad ethical position which asserts that if public funding has supported the creation of an idea, research or other content then it is reasonable and fair that it be made publicly accessible.”</p>
<p>The policy also encourages copyright owners “to apply a Creative Commons Licence to their intellectual output to determine how material may be used, reused or repurposed.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/staff-profile?staffId=Penny.Carnaby" target="_blank">Penny Carnaby, the University Librarian at Lincoln</a>, had been aware of the benefits of open access and open licensing since her time as National Librarian at the National Library of New Zealand (NLNZ), where she participated in the Chief Executives’ steering group on open data and information during the development of <a href="https://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/" target="_blank">NZGOAL</a>.</p>
<p>Approved by Cabinet in 2010, NZGOAL -- the New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework -- supports and advocates for the uptake of Creative Commons licensing for copyright works produced or funded by State Services agencies.</p>
<p>From her experience at NLNZ, Penny became particularly interested in opening up copyright works produced by the university sector -- including journal articles, datasets and educational resources. She also noted the growing importance of <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/institutional-repositories-101/" target="_blank">Institutional Repositories</a> in research libraries around the world as a way of ensuring much greater public access to the intellectual output of an academic institution. Penny had been at National Library when the network of IRs was established, along with the NLNZ managed <a href="http://www.nzresearch.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZResearch</a>, which uses a DigitalNZ powered harvester to gather information from research deposited in repositories across the New Zealand research sector and make them easier to find.</p>
<p>Noting the strength of <a href="posts/2014/10/09/www.researcharchive@lincoln.ac.nz." target="_blank">Lincoln’s Institutional Repository, LURA,</a> Penny began to investigate what it would take to develop an open access policy at Lincoln -- New Zealand’s first -- in line with other universities around the world. The policy was given strong support from the Vice Chancellor, Dr Andrew West, who nominated open access as a business driver for the university in 2013.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0-MfI4ma-U?rel=0&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]</p>
<p>This strong institutional support enabled a process of consultation across the university, which gave university staff an opportunity to voice concerns before the policy was approved. The university also developed a joint union and management working party, which spent six months working through issues and developing a final policy that the university community could be comfortable with.</p>
<p>Penny notes that research staff were, generally speaking, comfortable with the principle of open scholarship, as they could see the inherent benefits of OA to disseminating their research to a broader audience.</p>
<p>The same was not true of open educational resources, which was a relatively novel concept to most teaching staff. “Academics are generally dual professionals,” Penny points out. “Each profession -- teaching and research -- has different drivers. Researchers are often fundamentally motivated by the desire to see their published works have a broad public impact. We found that the same is not necessarily true of academic teaching resources.</p>
<p>“In the end, we developed an elegant and respectful solution: the copyright to educational resources would remain with the creator, while the university would retain the right to use these resources for the educational purposes of the institution -- such as using them as open educational resources in MOOCs.”</p>
<p>Penny notes that this process of discussion and consultation was both the most important and most difficult part of implementing open access across the university.</p>
<p>In order to support the implementation process, <a href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/About/News/Current-news/Te-Wiki--Open-Access-Week-events/" target="_blank">Lincoln held its Open Access Week in July</a>, holding several public events, including a talk by Dr Mark Hahnel, CEO of <a href="http://figshare.com/" target="_blank">Figshare</a>, and a debate on Open Access, with the moot 'Open Access or Open Slather?' Penny was placed on the 'Open Slather' team, and <a title="Researcher’s Lament" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/pennys-poem/" target="_blank">presented this poem as part of her argument</a>).</p>
<p>These events helped expose awareness gaps in the institution, which a university wide implementation group is helping to address.</p>
<p>Penny advises other other institutions developing an OA policy to “make the policy itself as broad as possible -- including not only research articles but educational resources and even public records. Institutions will also need to develop the policies alongside other, existing policy settings, such as data management and intellectual property.”</p>
<p>“And then think very carefully about implementation. Implementation is everything.” At Lincoln, this process of implementing the policy has led to -- at last count -- eighty-seven discrete activities across the university.</p>
<p>“Open Access changes every conversation you have,” says Penny. “Rather than arguing why works need to be open, the focus at Lincoln University is on why certain works need to be closed. This requires a massive cultural shift to take place.”</p>

<h5><strong>BY MATT MCGREGOR</strong></h5>
<p>In July 2013, Lincoln University passed <a href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/About/Policies/Open-Access-Policy/" target="_blank">a wide-ranging Open Access policy</a>, becoming the first New Zealand university to do so. Coverage includes research outputs including data, teaching materials and the University’s business records.</p>
<p>The policy states that “as an organisation Lincoln University has a policy position which endorses making content openly and freely available as the first and preferred option.” It goes on to state that "Lincoln University takes a broad ethical position which asserts that if public funding has supported the creation of an idea, research or other content then it is reasonable and fair that it be made publicly accessible.”</p>
<p>The policy also encourages copyright owners “to apply a Creative Commons Licence to their intellectual output to determine how material may be used, reused or repurposed.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/staff-profile?staffId=Penny.Carnaby" target="_blank">Penny Carnaby, the University Librarian at Lincoln</a>, had been aware of the benefits of open access and open licensing since her time as National Librarian at the National Library of New Zealand (NLNZ), where she participated in the Chief Executives’ steering group on open data and information during the development of <a href="https://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/" target="_blank">NZGOAL</a>.</p>
<p>Approved by Cabinet in 2010, NZGOAL -- the New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework -- supports and advocates for the uptake of Creative Commons licensing for copyright works produced or funded by State Services agencies.</p>
<p>From her experience at NLNZ, Penny became particularly interested in opening up copyright works produced by the university sector -- including journal articles, datasets and educational resources. She also noted the growing importance of <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/institutional-repositories-101/" target="_blank">Institutional Repositories</a> in research libraries around the world as a way of ensuring much greater public access to the intellectual output of an academic institution. Penny had been at National Library when the network of IRs was established, along with the NLNZ managed <a href="http://www.nzresearch.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZResearch</a>, which uses a DigitalNZ powered harvester to gather information from research deposited in repositories across the New Zealand research sector and make them easier to find.</p>
<p>Noting the strength of <a href="posts/www.researcharchive@lincoln.ac.nz." target="_blank">Lincoln’s Institutional Repository, LURA,</a> Penny began to investigate what it would take to develop an open access policy at Lincoln -- New Zealand’s first -- in line with other universities around the world. The policy was given strong support from the Vice Chancellor, Dr Andrew West, who nominated open access as a business driver for the university in 2013.</p>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/t0-MfI4ma-U?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>This strong institutional support enabled a process of consultation across the university, which gave university staff an opportunity to voice concerns before the policy was approved. The university also developed a joint union and management working party, which spent six months working through issues and developing a final policy that the university community could be comfortable with.</p>
<p>Penny notes that research staff were, generally speaking, comfortable with the principle of open scholarship, as they could see the inherent benefits of OA to disseminating their research to a broader audience.</p>
<p>The same was not true of open educational resources, which was a relatively novel concept to most teaching staff. “Academics are generally dual professionals,” Penny points out. “Each profession -- teaching and research -- has different drivers. Researchers are often fundamentally motivated by the desire to see their published works have a broad public impact. We found that the same is not necessarily true of academic teaching resources.</p>
<p>“In the end, we developed an elegant and respectful solution: the copyright to educational resources would remain with the creator, while the university would retain the right to use these resources for the educational purposes of the institution -- such as using them as open educational resources in MOOCs.”</p>
<p>Penny notes that this process of discussion and consultation was both the most important and most difficult part of implementing open access across the university.</p>
<p>In order to support the implementation process, <a href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/About/News/Current-news/Te-Wiki--Open-Access-Week-events/" target="_blank">Lincoln held its Open Access Week in July</a>, holding several public events, including a talk by Dr Mark Hahnel, CEO of <a href="http://figshare.com/" target="_blank">Figshare</a>, and a debate on Open Access, with the moot 'Open Access or Open Slather?' Penny was placed on the 'Open Slather' team, and <a title="Researcher’s Lament" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/pennys-poem/" target="_blank">presented this poem as part of her argument</a>).</p>
<p>These events helped expose awareness gaps in the institution, which a university wide implementation group is helping to address.</p>
<p>Penny advises other other institutions developing an OA policy to “make the policy itself as broad as possible -- including not only research articles but educational resources and even public records. Institutions will also need to develop the policies alongside other, existing policy settings, such as data management and intellectual property.”</p>
<p>“And then think very carefully about implementation. Implementation is everything.” At Lincoln, this process of implementing the policy has led to -- at last count -- eighty-seven discrete activities across the university.</p>
<p>“Open Access changes every conversation you have,” says Penny. “Rather than arguing why works need to be open, the focus at Lincoln University is on why certain works need to be closed. This requires a massive cultural shift to take place.”</p>

<h5><strong>BY PENNY CARNABY
<p></p></strong></h5>
<p>OPEN, ACCESS, promiscuity ...all bubble but no squeak</p>
<p>Has come out to wreck LU’s Open Access week</p>
<p>With definitions so pious and platitudes by the score</p>
<p>Cry out..</p>
<p>Free! Open! Saviours STOP! It makes our ears sore!</p>
<p>Open this Open that.. Is it Gold or just Green?</p>
<p>With MOOCS, mashups and link rot UG, it sounds quite obscene!</p>
<p>Defining OA can lead to copious frustrations</p>
<p>With Berlin, APCs and even Budapest declarations!</p>
<p>With this hype and confusion getting us in the poo</p>
<p>What on earth are our glorious researchers to do?</p>
<p>With this rapidly growing Open Access disputation</p>
<p>We must at all cost, AFFIRM academic reputation!!!</p>
<p><em>Researcher’s Lament was written for an OA week at Lincoln University, June 2014, as part of the LU Great Debate 2014 - for the negative side. The moot: Open Access enhances academic reputation.  Penny is the University Librarian and Professor Digital Knowledge Systems at Lincoln University. </em></p>

<p></p>
<p>On 4 March 2014, the University of Waikato <a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/news-events/media/2014/03university-of-waikato-approves-open-access-mandate-guidelines.shtml" target="_blank">announced the passage of an open access mandate</a>, becoming the first university to adopt a direct deposit mandate in New Zealand, and the second university, after Lincoln, to adopt an institutional OA policy.</p>
<p>The primary principle driving the adoption of the policy, as stated on its opening line, is that “Freedom to exchange ideas and to publish acquired knowledge are fundamental to the purposes of a university.”</p>
<p>The policy represents the University of Waikato’s commitment “to the concept of open access to knowledge through the deposit of full text, academic publications into the University’s digital repository, the Research Commons, wherever possible.”</p>
<p>The momentum for the policy was established during <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/waikato.ac.nz/open-access-week-2012/panel-sessions" target="_blank">Open Access Week 2012,</a> when OA advocates Fabiana Kubke and Alex Holcombe spoke at a panel entitled, ‘An Open Access Mandate for the University of Waikato?’ The panel generated interest in OA from the university community, and led to David Nichols, Senior Lecturer in Computer Science, and Ross Hallett, University Librarian, to develop a detailed paper outlining the benefits, risks and options for an OA policy at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>In that paper, David and Ross deliberately provided the university with options as to what the final OA policy might look like. As David says, “We deliberately provided the university with a range of options and wording for the policy. We also made sure that we explicitly laid out the costs and benefits.”</p>
<p>In presenting the policy to groups within the university, David emphasised the importance of the digital visibility of the institution and noted the successful deposit mandate in place for student theses since 2006.</p>
<p>In terms of benefits, David and Ross pointed to the increased download rates, potential citation advantages, as well as the broader importance of making the university’s research available to the wider society, including industry, university alumni and professional groups, such as teachers and journalists.</p>
<p>David notes that higher ideals, such as the need for the public to have access to publicly funded research, were also emphasised during the consultation process. This ties in nicely with the motto of the university “Ko Te Tangata - For the People” -- a motto which ended up introducing the policy for its embodiment of the university’s “commitment to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible.”</p>
<p>After releasing the paper, it travelled for several months -- with David and Ross-- through the various committees of the university, a process which enabled staff from every school and faculty to provide comment and raise potential concerns.</p>
<p>One such concern was the question of what happens if infringing material is uploaded to the IR. Some academics were concerned about possible liability, should they mistakenly upload material for which they do not have the rights. They were reassured when told that Library repository staff would continue to offer a mediated deposit service, checking publisher copyright agreements for potential infringement before adding items to the repository.</p>
<p>The consultation process also provided the opportunity to clarify confusion around green and gold OA, as well as the names publishers give to document versions at different stages of the review process, such as ‘preprint’, ‘postprint’ and ‘published’.</p>
<p>David noted that it was also important for Waikato to include a waiver in their policy, for those publications that may not be appropriate for deposit in the IR. “It was important that the policy wasn’t seen as entirely black and white.”</p>
<p>According to the widely accepted OA colour scheme, Waikato’s policy is green, with no references to gold (or publisher-implemented) OA or Creative Commons licensing.</p>
<p>As David points out, “We’ve restricted the definition of OA for this policy to ‘read-only.’ The policy doesn’t engage with reuse rights at all. These are issues that we may be able to address in future revisions, though it was important that this policy took the simplest first step.</p>
<p>“A general notion of incrementalism was essential to the whole process, especially given the fact that scholarly publishing is a changing landscape, with many moving parts, including requirements from external funders.”</p>
<p>This incremental approach followed those taken by comparable institutions overseas, such as Queensland University to Technology, who have had a deposit mandate since 2004. David and Ross consulted with QUT during the development of the policy.</p>
<p>“QUT have also made public useful information about the progress of their policy over time, including graphs of the effects on deposit rates. Their model suggested that we needed to take a long term approach to implementing the policy -- there was never going to be an instant change. Progress will be gradual.”</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why Waikato didn’t follow the example of another leading OA institution, the University of Liège, which mandates that only works deposited in the Institutional Repository will be considered during internal promotion and review. While this is a good model for increasing the number of works in the IR, it is potentially less helpful for gaining support from researchers.</p>
<p>David is now working with the Library, Research Office and Information Technology Services to implement a new research information system -- called Symplectic Elements-- to help reduce the transaction costs of depositing research into the university’s repository.</p>
<p>As David pointed out, while the policy is important, the means of technically implementing the policy must be as smooth as possible. With the new system, the time commitment required by the academic to deposit an article should be no more than the time required to respond to an email request.</p>
<p>The new system will also help Waikato determine the baseline number of OA articles currently published by university staff, which will make it easier to chart progress in the years to come.</p>
<p>Ultimately, David underlines the importance of basing the OA efforts at the library. He also advises other institutions looking at OA to factor in a lot of consultation and listening to staff. As disciplines have their own norms and terminology, it’s also important to find advocates across the university’s various schools and faculties.</p>
<p>David also reiterates the importance of not trying to solve all the problems with scholarly publishing in one fell swoop. “The policy,” David says, “is just the first step.”</p>

<p>In terms of benefits, David and Ross pointed to increased download rates and potential citation advantages. They also noted the broader importance of making the university’s research available to society in general, including industry, university alumni, and professional groups, such as teachers and journalists.</p>
<p>David notes that higher ideals, such as the need for the public to have access to publicly funded research, were also emphasised during the consultation process. This ties in nicely with the motto of the university “Ko Te Tangata - For the People” -- which, in the context of OA, is expressed as the university’s “commitment to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible.”</p>
<p>After releasing the paper, it travelled for several months -- with David and Ross -- through the various committees of the university, a process which enabled staff from every school and faculty to provide comment and raise potential concerns.</p>
<p>One such concern was the question of what happens if infringing material is uploaded to the institutional repository (IR). Some academics were concerned about possible liability, should they mistakenly upload material for which they do not have the rights. They were reassured when told that Library repository staff would continue to offer a mediated deposit service, checking publisher copyright agreements for potential infringement before adding items to the repository.</p>
<p>The consultation process also provided the opportunity to clarify confusion around green and gold OA, as well as the names publishers give to document versions at different stages of the review process, such as ‘preprint’, ‘postprint’ and ‘published’.</p>
<p>David noted that it was also important for Waikato to include a waiver in their policy, for those publications that may not be appropriate for deposit in the IR. “It was important that the policy wasn’t seen as entirely black and white.”</p>
<p>According to the widely accepted OA colour scheme, Waikato’s policy is green, with no references to gold (or publisher-implemented) OA or Creative Commons licensing.</p>
<p>As David points out, “We’ve restricted the definition of OA for this policy to ‘read-only.’ The policy doesn’t engage with reuse rights at all. These are issues that we may be able to address in future revisions, though it was important that this policy took the simplest first step.</p>
<p>“A general notion of incrementalism was essential to the whole process, especially given the fact that scholarly publishing is a changing landscape, with many moving parts, including requirements from external funders.”</p>
<p>This incremental approach followed those taken by comparable institutions overseas, such as Queensland University of Technology, which has had a deposit mandate since 2004. David and Ross consulted with QUT during the development of the policy.</p>
<p>“QUT has also made public useful information about the progress of its policy over time, including graphs of the effects on deposit rates. Its model suggested that we needed to take a long-term approach to implementing the policy -- there was never going to be an instant change. Progress will be gradual.”</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why Waikato didn’t follow the example of another leading OA institution, the University of Liège, which mandates that only works deposited in the Institutional Repository will be considered during internal promotion and review. While this is a good model for increasing the number of works in the IR, it is potentially less helpful for gaining support from researchers.</p>
<p>David is now working with the Library, Research Office and Information Technology Services to implement a new research information system -- called Symplectic Elements -- to help reduce the transaction costs of depositing research into the university’s repository.</p>
<p>As David pointed out, while the policy is important, the means of technically implementing the policy must be as smooth as possible. With the new system, the time commitment required by the academic to deposit an article should be no more than the time required to respond to an email request.</p>
<p>The new system will also help Waikato determine the baseline number of OA articles currently published by university staff, which will make it easier to chart progress in the years to come.</p>
<p>Ultimately, David underlines the importance of basing the OA efforts at the library. He also advises other institutions looking at OA to factor in a lot of consultation and listening to staff. As different disciplines have their own norms and terminology, it’s also important to find advocates across the university’s various schools and faculties.</p>
<p>David also reiterates the importance of not trying to solve all the problems with scholarly publishing in one fell swoop. “The policy is just the first step.”</p>
