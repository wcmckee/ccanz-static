<p>For the month of March (and a little bit of April), Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand have been travelling around New Zealand spreading the word about open access and open licensing for local Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums. In case you didn't make it to any of these events, we've embedded the slides below, along with a short summary of what they said.</p>
<p></p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Matt McGregor and Elizabeth Heritage, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</span></h5>
<p>Matt and Elizabeth began by introducing Creative Commons licensing in Aotearoa New Zealand. They then noted that, while new technologies had provided heritage organisations new opportunities to share their digital collections for reuse, copyright and licensing was still a significant barrier. Usage rights statements, they said, were often vague, overly restrictive &amp; not standardised across the sector. They then ran through three specific recommendations, outlined in the slides, before giving a brief introduction to the licences themselves.</p>
<p>[slideshare id=46702250&amp;w=476&amp;h=400&amp;sc=no]</p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Keitha Booth, New Zealand Open Government Information and Data Programme</span></h5>

<p>Keitha introduced the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework, which advocates for the use of CC licensing across the state sector. Keitha noted that the Open Government Data and Information Programme had expanded its focus to local government. She outlined the NZGOAL adoption process, and the policy framework for each institution, both of which are detailed in the slides, below.</p>
<p>[slideshare id=46702435&amp;w=476&amp;h=400&amp;sc=no]</p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Victoria Leachman, Rights Advisor, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa</span></h5>

<p>Victoria outlined Te Papa's experiences with Creative Commons licensing, beginning with the Rita Angus podcasts in 2008. Victoria noted that CC licensing these podcasts had enabled them to be used by other institutions touring the exhibition - without Te Papa having to write detailed usage agreements. After running through several other CC projects, Victoria discussed the download project, which has so far released over 48,000 images for free high-resolution download. Victoria noted that usage was much greater than predicted at the beginning of the project, and that it was being used for a range of purposes. Victoria closed her presentation by outlining the challenges to open access and open licensing for the GLAM sector, and highlighting the approach taken thus far by Te Papa.</p>
<p>[slideshare id=46702446&amp;w=476&amp;h=400&amp;sc=no]</p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager, DigitalNZ</span></h5>

<p>After introducing DigitalNZ and its mission, Thomasin showed the famous 'magic hat' diagram, which outlines how content from individuals and organisations around New Zealand is harvested by the DigitalNZ and made more easily searchable by the aforementioned magic hat (otherwise known as the DigitalNZ API). She then gave an overview of DigitalNZ's approach to rights, and pointed out some of the common issues faced by DigitalNZ as it attempts to provide clear rights information to end users. Thomasin argued that the point of working through these rights issues was to help produce "A world in which our shared cultural heritage is open to all, regardless of their background. A world in which people are no longer passive consumers of cultural content created by an elite, but contribute, participate, create and share." Thomasin concluded by several standout local and international open GLAM case studies.</p>
<p>[slideshare id=46702442&amp;w=476&amp;h=400&amp;sc=no]</p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader, The Alexander Turnbull Library</span></h5>

<p>Mark began by noting that the internal debates around use and reuse within the National Library of New Zealand repeated debates that are taking place in society at large. Many of the issues arodund reusing collection items were difficult, and many of them turned on the notion of trust. Mark then noted that rights statements across the sector were inconsistent, and that the National Library of New Zealand had developed a set of policy principles to addressed this inconsistency, which are outlined in the slides. Implementation, he said, was ongoing, though three issues currently being addressed were donor and depositor agreements, a flowchart to guide the release process and improving the rights statements and licensing on indigenous knowledge works.</p>
<p>[slideshare id=46702437&amp;w=476&amp;h=400&amp;sc=no]</p>
<h5><span style="color:#800000;">Allison Brown, Digital Services Coordinator, University of Otago Library</span></h5>

<p>Allison discussed the use of Creative Commons licensing within the University of Otago library. In particular, she gave her experience in discussing CC licensing with rights holders, applying CC licensing in a library context, supporting the use of CC by others, managing the use of CC and promoting CC to others.</p>

Made available by REANNZ under a Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence." width="593" height="391"></a> Action from the ROCS Workshop in Queenstown, New Zealand, 25 March 2015. Made available by REANNZ under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence</a>.</p>
<p>On the morning of 25 March, I found myself helping Fabiana Kubke and Cameron McLean run a workshop for a hodge-podge of enthusiastic librarians, researchers and infrastructure providers in a conference room in Queenstown, New Zealand.</p>
<p>The workshop was held in Queenstown as part of the <a href="http://www.eresearch.org.nz/content/eresearch-nz-2015" target="_blank">eResearch NZ 2015 conference</a>, organised by the National e-Science Infrastructure (NeSI), Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand (REANNZ) and New Zealand Genomics Limited (NZGL). The conference brought together researchers and infrastructure providers to, as the name of the conference suggests, discuss the future of eResearch in Aotearoa.</p>
<p>We were there to tease out how we might develop open educational resources on Reproducible, Open and Collaborative Science research (i.e. research that ROCS - thanks to Peter Murray-Rust for the splendid acronym-ing. And yes, the allusion to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_%28mythology%29" target="_blank">the mythical Roc</a> is entirely intentional.). These open resources will be incorporated into a cross-disciplinary 700-level (i.e. postgraduate) course at the University of Auckland, though we are hopeful that the resources could be used for a range of different purposes across the New Zealand tertiary education sector and beyond.</p>
<p>We had come well prepared. Fabiana and Cameron had held a similar workshop in Auckland in September last year, and had a heap of data from those sessions regarding which skills and tools researchers valued. While at Mozfest in 2014, Fabiana had also worked with the wonderful Kaitlin Thainey (from Mozilla Science Lab) and the equally wonderful Billy Meinke (then at CC International) to help develop a flexible and modular structure.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to cover. Open research, broadly defined, refers to a research process that effectively ‘bakes in’ openness from the beginning. This ensures that other researchers -- as well as people who aren’t researchers or experts in any given field -- can follow the research process, which makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues and to reproduce the research in other contexts (<a href="http://www.jove.com/blog/2012/05/03/studies-show-only-10-of-published-science-articles-are-reproducible-what-is-happening" target="_blank">which is not always easy</a>).</p>
<p>The other reason to make research more open is to give access to a range of groups currently almost entirely excluded from research. These include policy makers, advocates, citizen scientists, journalists, teachers and students outside of large research institutions -- as well as the general public, who have often paid for the research in the first place.</p>
<p>This is a big issue, and copyright and open licensing is only one aspect. As the picture above suggests, there are heaps of skills needed to practise open research; moreover, many of these skills are generally <i>not</i> taught in the existing science education system. How, then, do we teach open research skills, to make open research standard practice across the research sector?</p>
<p>One of the difficulties is that most established researchers don’t know quite what ‘open research’ looks like, and generally lack the basic knowledge, skills and tools required make their research truly open. This is a problem, because established researchers -- like established teachers, librarians, government officials and Public Leads of Creative Commons -- pass on the norms of research practice on to their students, and thus reproduce the system as they know it.</p>
<p>The solution devised by Fabiana and team is to start from the middle: i.e, with postgraduate and early-career researchers. Rather than take on the twin challenge of immediately scaling a course to several thousand undergraduates and attempting to change the practices of late-career researchers, the aim is to train the next generation of researchers and lecturers in the ethos and practices of open research.</p>
<p>So, what did we cover? Rather than lecture at a room of experts, we decided to mine them for their expertise. Employing a delicate mix of table arrangements, peer pressure and sugary incentives, we had the attendees arrange themselves into five groups, and from there Cameron gave them a series of activities so they could share the skills and tools necessary to conduct open research.</p>
<p>The response was fantastic - so fantastic that I could barely keep up. One of the initial questions - what is missing from our existing modules? - received at least 18 responses, and it seemed like the following question - which skills are most important? - could have had a 75-minute workshop all of its own.</p>
<p>The workshop ended with a discussion on some of the practicalities of teaching open science, a discussion that sadly had to be cut short at the end of our allotted 75 minutes.</p>
<p>After the session, Cameron, Fabiana and I met to debrief, and agreed that the skills the open resources would need to address - such as research communication, data management, collaboration, versioning and visualisation - were notably <i>not</i> specific to computer scientists, and, more notably, not even limited to scientists. While there were some technical and domain-specific suggestions (one of my notes reads “optimising in a parallel universe”: how great does that sound?), the groups soon began to focus on skills and capabilities that would be useful to researchers across every discipline.</p>
<p>Practising what we preach, Cameron has shared <a href="https://github.com/kubke/MozFest2014-OS-Skills-Curriculum/wiki/eResearchNZ-2015-Workshop" target="_blank">all our existing data and resources on Github</a>. My rough notes from the session are <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/6iKGo4Qi1E" target="_blank">on an etherpad here</a>, and will be expanded as we bring the notes from participants together. We (and by we I mean Cameron) also has a pile of written notes from the participants that we’re going to gather together and publish.</p>

<h5><strong>BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE</strong></h5>
<p>Wow, we turned around twice and suddenly it’s the fourth week of the Creative Commons Road Trip!</p>
<p>Today Matt McGregor and I were in the same room as each other for the first time in a couple of weeks, and we took the opportunity to swap notes. It’s been a crazy busy fortnight but so much fun. Huge thanks to our awesome team of speakers and facilitators who are doing such a brilliant job -- and thank you to everyone who has come along so far. We’re really enjoying meeting new people, fielding new questions (that always make us think!), and hearing new stories about how Kiwis are using -- or want to use -- Creative Commons in such a range of different ways.</p>
<p>Week 2 of the Road Trip saw us travelling around the country; Matt in the North Island and me in the South. Between us -- and with the help of our trusty facilitators -- we delivered events in Hamilton, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Whanganui. Then Week 3 was even busier: the Creative Commons Road Trip made back to Auckland, Hamilton, and Dunedin, plus branching out to Tauranga and Palmerston North. Events have been targeted at the schools and heritage sectors.</p>
<p>It’s been great to have requests come in from schools and heritage institutions around the country for events where they are. We’ve added Napier to the mix now! The CC Road Trip will be there on 1-2 April.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-488" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"></a> CC BY</p>
<p>As if that weren’t enough, we’re really pleased to announce that we’re extending the Road Trip and branching out into Open Education. Come along to hear about the future of Open Educational Resources in Aotearoa, featuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Billy Meinke, formerly of Creative Commons International, who will talk about his experience with some of the world’s largest OER projects, including the US Government’s $2billion TAAACT grants for OERs at community colleges.</li>

    <li>Simon Hart, Richard White and Erika Pearson from the Media Text Hack team at the University of Otago, who will talk about the development of an open, CC-licensed Media Studies textbook — over the course of a weekend.</li>

    <li>Matt McGregor, Public Lead of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, who will talk about the future of OERs in the Kiwi tertiary sector, and talk about how educators and institutions can create, use and adopt open textbooks.</li>

</ul>
<p>We will be running events in mid-April in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch, completely free. <a title="OER events" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2015/03/open-education-in-aotearoa/" target="_blank">Register here</a>.</p>
<p>Onwards to Week 4! There are still places left for our Wellington and Christchurch heritage sector events, so <a title="GLAM Road Trip" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank">register today</a>!</p>

<p><em>This piece was originally published in the March edition of the <a title="Education Gazette" href="http://www.edgazette.govt.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Education Gazette Tukutuku Kōrero</a>.</em></p>
<p>How many times today have you broken the law? If you’re a teacher who likes to adapt and share resources, the answer might surprise you.</p>
<p>There is currently a major problem with copyright in education. Under the 1994 Copyright Act, employers (for schools, this means the Board of Trustees) hold the copyright to all teaching resources that teachers create in the course of their employment. This means that when teachers seek to save time and money by sharing these resources (including taking resources they have created from one job to another) but don't have the Board's express permission, they are infringing copyright and breaking the law.</p>
<p>That’s the bad news. The good news, however, is that help is at hand.</p>
<p>Copyright is not like other forms of intellectual property (like patents and trademarks): you don’t have to apply or register -- you don’t even have to use the little © symbol. Copyright occurs automatically upon the creation of a work, and it is entirely up to the owner to permit or deny the right to copy that work as they see fit.</p>
<p>All owners of copyright everywhere -- including Boards of Trustees -- have the power to give permission for (or ‘license’) others to reuse their copyright works in specific ways. However, most copyright owners are not sure exactly how to do this in a clear and legally robust manner.</p>
<p>This is where Creative Commons comes in: we provide free, legally robust and ‘human-readable’ licences that anyone can use to clarify what they want others to do -- and not do -- with their works. These licences can make copyright work for schools and for teachers, by enabling the sharing, adaptation and reuse of teaching resources and other works.</p>
<p>For this to happen, schools need to adopt a Creative Commons policy, which effectively changes -- and clarifies -- the school’s default relationship with copyright. Instead of making it illegal to share, these policies enable and encourage the sharing of resources using Creative Commons licensing.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, this sharing is becoming easier every day. The increasing availability of digital technologies and the rise of centralised resource sharing portals -- like the Network for Learning portal, <a title="Pond" href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/pond/" target="_blank">Pond </a>-- have made the process of sharing simple and quick.</p>
<p>As more New Zealand schools start using Pond, Creative Commons licences can ensure that every teacher is able to share and collaborate with colleagues in other schools around the country confidently and legally. Simply put, digital technologies and Pond make sharing resources easy; Creative Commons licences make sharing resources legal. And the potential time- and money-savings of national-level collaboration are huge.</p>
<p>By adopting a Creative Commons policy at your school, you’ll not only be making your working life easier, you’ll be following a growing trend. Over the past couple of years, over a hundred New Zealand schools have adopted a Creative Commons policy. Such policies provide a clear statement of a school’s position on in-copyright resources produced by teachers employed at the school, and allow teachers to use Creative Commons licensing to share their work for reuse. These policies also ensure that, when teachers leave, both the teacher and the school retain access to all teaching resources.</p>
<p>Schools with Creative Commons policies are well in line with current Government thinking. Boards of Trustees are encouraged to consider using Creative Commons licences for their teaching resources, using the <a title="NZGOAL" href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/" target="_blank">New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework</a>, approved by Cabinet in 2010. The recent <a title="Future Focused Learning Report" href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/EducationInitiatives/UFBInSchools/FutureFocusedLearning.aspx" target="_blank">Future Focused Learning in Connected Communities report</a>, put out by Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye’s 21st Century Learning Reference Group, supported this by encouraging schools to enable teachers to use Creative Commons licensing to share their resources.</p>
<p>One such school is Taupaki School, a co-educational primary school located an hour north-west of Auckland. On 20 February 2013, Taupaki School’s Board of Trustees passed a Creative Commons policy, giving permission to Taupaki’s teachers to share and collaborate, legally.</p>
<p>The idea for the policy was initially introduced by the school’s principal, Stephen Lethbridge, and was then overseen by Board Chair Paula Hogg.</p>
<p>Stephen introduced the idea of the policy after noticing that “teachers were sharing more and more resources online and connecting with a great many schools who were visiting us. It would have been a nightmare to seek permission from the board, more likely the school principal, every time a teacher or student wanted to share information.”</p>
<p>The Creative Commons policy is also strongly aligned with Taupaki School’s existing vision. Paula says, “Our school’s vision strongly encourages collaboration, and we encourage sharing, so it was a bit of a shock to learn that we needed to have a policy for teachers to share legally.  The Creative Commons policy was very aligned with our thinking as a board. There was no dissonance in our discussion. The main issue was that everyone was surprised to discover that this isn’t normal practice.”</p>
<p>According to Paula, the Creative Commons policy passed because it supported the fundamental mission of the school — improving student outcomes. “We knew from the documentation Stephen provided, and from other background reading, that professional development is actually one of the best ways to lift student outcomes. And a big part of professional development is sharing best practice, including resources.”</p>
<p>Works licensed under Creative Commons can also be a great resource for students as well as teachers. Since 2010, <a title="DigitalNZ" href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a> (at the National Library) has been running the <a title="Mix and Mash" href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_blank">Mix &amp; Mash</a> competition, which encourages Kiwi students to tell new stories by adapting and remixing Public Domain and Creative Commons licensed content.</p>
<p>In the May 2013 showcase, the student award was won by Travis, Evan and Jared Manning (aged 11, 9 and 6). Using stop motion animation, poetry, story writing and drawing, their video tells ‘The Story of Rangitoto.’ Judges praised the story as “a dramatic and exciting retelling of the origins of a familiar piece of the Auckland landscape."</p>
<p>As well as learning about copyright and licensing -- essential skills for digital citizenship -- Mix &amp; Mash also encourages students to actively and legally engage with their cultural heritage.</p>
<p>If you’re keen to learn more, and to see about getting Creative Commons licensing going at your school, the good news is that we’ve already done a lot of the legwork for you. Schools looking to adopt Creative Commons licensing can visit <a title="CC in Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools/" target="_blank">creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools</a> for a range of helpful tools, including an off-the-shelf Creative Commons policy that you can adapt for your own purposes.</p>

<p>Educational resources are becoming increasingly unaffordable: since 1978, textbook prices have risen 812%. According to research from the US Public Interest Research Groups, 65% of students choose not to buy a college textbook because it’s too expensive and 94% report that they suffer academically because of this choice.</p>
<p>As a result, more and more educators -- and higher education institutions -- have committed to develop and reuse <a title="Open Education" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/education/">Open Educational Resources</a> (OERs). OERs are resources that made openly available, free of technical, legal and price restrictions on reuse.</p>

<h5><strong>BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE</strong></h5>
<p>We have officially completed the first five events of the Creative Commons Road Trip! When we planned the events back in December last year, we were expecting a quiet start to the month, with some <a title="CC Road Trip schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/" target="_blank">schools events</a> in Auckland and Wellington, gradually branching out to Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin in the second week. In the third and fourth week, we were planning to basically repeat that pattern, shifting focus to the <a title="CC Road Trip GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank">heritage sector</a>.</p>
<p>As we promoted the month, though, we started to get requests from other parts of the country,  quickly turning a tour of the main centres into a truly national road trip. Now that the organisational dust has settled, we’ve decided to also visit Tauranga, Napier, Havelock North, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Nelson and Greymouth. We’re also making plans to visit Hutt City, Whangarei and Invercargill.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-488" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"></a> CC BY</p>
<p>So, we had a busy first week! In addition to the Creative Commons schools events in Wellington and Auckland, we held events in Greymouth, Nelson and Havelock North. Attendance varied: we had a small turnout for an after-school event in Auckland, though the staffroom at Havelock North High School at 8am was full.</p>
<p>Highlights from week one:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Network for Learning officially joined the Creative Commons Road Trip, with Tim Kong, Pete Hall and Carolyn Stuart attending the school events.</li>

    <li>We had some <a title="Bay of Plenty Times" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&amp;objectid=11412205" target="_blank">handy coverage</a> in the <i>Bay of Plenty Times</i>, advertising our events in Tauranga on 16 March.</li>

    <li>Melissa Laing, one of the new CC regional facilitators, gave her first (of many, we hope!) introductions to CC licensing, alongside Pete Hall from N4L and Esther Casey from Cognition Education.</li>

    <li>As one of our speakers was ill, Matt skyped into an event at Nelson Provincial Museum -- from a half-full internet cafe in Napier. Both the Nelson museum community and the Napier internet-cafe community now have a working knowledge of CC licensing in the heritage sector.</li>

    <li>We’re receiving a heap of requests to send out resources. Keep them coming!</li>

    <li>We’ve launched our <a title="CC resources" href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">new resources page</a>, full to the brim with brochures, videos, posters and case studies on CC licensing in tertiary education, research, heritage and schools.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-GLAM.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-489" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-GLAM-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"></a> CC BY</p>
<p>In week two -- starting today! -- we’re going to be running schools events in Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton and Dunedin, as well as a heritage event in Whanganui. Week two happens to overlap with international <a title="Open Education Week" href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_blank">Open Education Week</a>, so we’re excited to join our friends and colleagues around the world in spreading the news on the benefits of open educational resources. There are still places available at all our upcoming events, so <a title="CC Road Trip" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/12/announcing-our-march-events/" target="_blank">register today</a>!</p>
