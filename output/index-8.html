<p>Since the adoption of the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/declaration-open-and-transparent-government" target="_blank">Declaration on Open and Transparent Government in August 2011</a>, New Zealand's government agencies have been releasing their high-value data for innovative reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. By June 2012, 75% of all government departments had already released their data, and the majority had plans to do so in the future.</p>
<p>And yet, as the open government folks like to say, you're only as good as your last reuse.  This is why Creative Commons licences are so important: they allow members of the public to share, remix and reuse public data, without having to ask permission in advance. Going by download figures from platforms like<a title="Koordinates: the one place for geodata" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/10/koordinates-the-one-place-for-geodata/" target="_blank"> Koordinates</a>, more people are viewing and downloading publicly funded data. But what about reuse?</p>
<p>There are a few great examples coming to light. Last week, the government's ICT hub published two new case studies. The first, <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/open-data-case-studies/anz-truckometer-case-study" target="_blank">on the ANZ truckometer</a>, has<a href="http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/truckometer-buoyed-strong-dairy-activity-ca-121000" target="_blank"> received</a> <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/7652708/Agriculture-drives-weak-economy" target="_blank">a lot of</a> <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/7476113/Truckometer-suggests-weak-economy" target="_blank">media</a> <a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/115752/indicator-suggests-economy-will-continue-to-muddle-along" target="_blank">attention</a> since its release in April. Using traffic volume data released by NZTA,</p>
<p></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">"ANZ selected key routes and applied statistical techniques to smooth out anomalies and gaps. The result is a strong correlation between traffic flows and predicting economic growth or decline as measured by GDPdata from Statistics New Zealand. ANZ has found that, in general, light traffic flows give a 6 month heads-up on the direction the economy will take and heavy traffic flows give an even more accurate picture 6 months later."</p>
<p>The second case study <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/open-data-case-studies/charities-register" target="_blank">looked at the Charities Register</a>, a tool released by the Charities Commission in June 2011. The Register offers information from over 25, 000 registered charities for reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. Since this initial release, the Register has been used by:</p>
<ul>
<li>funding bodies like The Southern Trust;</li>

    <li>government bodies like the Ministry for Social Development and the Families Commission;</li>

    <li>media organisations;</li>

    <li>students and researchers;</li>

    <li>local government bodies, like the Manawatu District Council; and,</li>

    <li>volunteer portals, such as that under construction by Student Job Search.</li>

</ul>
<p>These are, of course, just a couple of examples of how government data is being released and reused--there are many, many more. Some of these are up at <a href="http://opendatastories.org/" target="_blank">Open Data Stories</a>. Creative Commons and the good people in the New Zealand Open Government Data and Information Programme will continue to release more case studies in the weeks ahead. Look out for these, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/case-studies/" target="_blank">check out some of our older case studies</a>, and get in touch if you've been reusing openly licensed government data. We're always keen to hear what you've doing.</p>

<h5>I've heard of Creative Commons, but I'm not really sure what it is.</h5>
<p>Fair enough. In a nutshell, the most open Creative Commons licences allow your audience to share, remix and reuse your work, without having to ask your permission in advance. For more details, check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/25684782"> this video</a>, have a look at <a title="Resources" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank">our resources page</a>, peruse the range of<a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos" target="_blank"> international videos</a> and then, if you've still got any questions, flick me an email: admin@creativecommons.org.nz</p>
<h5>If I use Creative Commons, I won't be able to make any money, right?</h5>

<p>Wrong. There's nothing about using a Creative Commons licence that stops you from making money. Remember, with Creative Commons licences, you keep your copyright. All the licences do is give your audience advance permission to share your work.</p>
<h5>But if I give my work an open licence, how will I make money?</h5>

<p>Fair question. There are a variety of possible models. If you're a painter, you might share digital copies of your work to generate publicity, and to attract buyers beyond the relatively small New Zealand art scene. If you're a musician, you might use an open licence to sell tickets to your shows. If you're a writer, you might decide that releasing a digital copy, with all the free distribution and publicity this implies, will increase sales at book-stores.</p>
<h5>Will this really work for everyone?</h5>

<p>There are no guarantees, but an open licence means that the potential pool of people interested in your work--and willing to pay for some version of it--is many, many times larger. It's worth remembering that most New Zealand artists don't make a living selling their work, but have to rely on support from funding agencies like Creative NZ or, more likely, hold down a day job.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2009-02-25-magicpen_031.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2067" title="2009-02-25-magicpen_03" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2009-02-25-magicpen_031.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="433"></a> A page from <a href="posts/2012/10/02/hicksvillecomics.com/magicpen/?p=28">Sam Zabel and the Magic Pen</a>, by Dylan Horrocks. Made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 New Zealand License.</a></p>
<h5>It sounds a bit radical for me. What's wrong with the old models of production and distribution?</h5>

<p>Quite simply, they pre-date the internet. Digital production and distribution channels provide artists with much larger potential audiences. At the very least, artists should consider pursuing both models at once, using online publicity to drive more conventional, off-line opportunities.</p>
<h5>Right. But what's this got to do with Creative Commons?</h5>

<p>Creative Commons licences give your audience permission to share and--if you decide to adopt our free culture licences--remix and reuse your work. This will ensure your work is experienced by as many people as possible.  Without an open licence, it is illegal for your audience to share or reuse your work.</p>
<h5>Do I have to licence everything?</h5>

<p>Nope. While some people like to licence everything they make, others choose to dip their toes in the Creative Commons waters. Gary Henderson, a playwright and theatre director, chose <a href="http://www.rocketman.co.nz/free/index.html" target="_blank">to licence a few scripts</a>. <a href="http://jemshed.com/" target="_blank">Jem Yoshioka </a>published an entire comic, <em><a href="http://jemshed.theotherwalls.com/comic/sunshine/" target="_blank">Sunshine</a></em>, on her website, while Gary Peters put up some <a href="http://www.garypeters.info/" target="_blank">images of his installations</a>. While Dylan Horrocks's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hicksville_%28comics%29" target="_blank"><em>Hicksville</em></a> is published under full copyright,<a href="http://hicksvillecomics.com/" target="_blank"> the comics on his website</a> are all made available under a Creative Commons Attribution Non Commerial licence.</p>
<h5>I'm not a lawyer. Isn't this going to be a hassle?</h5>

<p>Wrong again. Creative Commons licences are free and easy to understand. While we love to hear from licence users, you don't even need to register: all you need to do is figure out which licence you'd like to use, then copy and paste the icon and licensing statement from the Creative Commons website. The Creative Commons icon contains HTML metadata, enabling search engines to find your work. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/" target="_blank">With our new licensing tool</a>, it really is ridiculously easy.</p>
<h5>But I don't read legalese. How do I know what I'm getting myself into?</h5>

<p>I sympathise. But unlike many legal documents, our licences have been specially translated into <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">human-readable language</a>, so you and your audience know exactly what kind of licence you're providing.</p>
<h5>I've licensed my work. What happens next?</h5>

<p>Here's the thing: We actually have no idea. No one does. That's the beauty of an open licence; it's also the beauty of the internet. Because works with a Creative Commons licence can be freely shared, your work could travel around the world. This might not necessarily happen to your work, though under the default All Rights Reserved of full copyright, your audience would have to break the law for this happen.<em></em></p>
<h5>Give me some success stories.</h5>

<p>Alright. Your openly licensed work might, like Bronwyn Holloway Smith's <a href="http://bronwyn.co.nz/projects/gifts/" target="_blank">Ghosts in the Form of Gifts</a>, get picked up for <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/bronwyn-holloway-smith/" target="_blank">an American art show</a>. It could, like Disasteradio, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/03/luke-rowell-disasteradio/" target="_blank">help you tour the world</a>. Your work could, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/09/how-a-19-year-old-student-became-one-of-the-hottest-political-photographers-in-the-country/" target="_blank">like nineteen year old American photographer Gage Skidmore</a>, end up featuring in major newspapers and magazines, including The Atlantic and American news network MSNBC.</p>
<h5>Impressive, but how will people know it's my work?</h5>

<p>The six main Creative Commons licences all requires users to provide attribution, including a link back to the original work. This means that everyone who sees your work will always know the original author and be able to visit your website.</p>
<h5>What if people don't follow the conditions of the licence?</h5>

<p>If people break the conditions of your licence, then the licence is revoked.</p>
<h5>Tell me again why I'd want to use Creative Commons?</h5>

<p>There's a bunch of reasons. It might be because you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximise exposure and increase distribution;</li>

    <li>Use an innovative business model;</li>

    <li>Contribute to and participate in the public sphere;</li>

    <li>Encourage collaboration; or,</li>

    <li>Grow the commons.</li>

</ul>
<h5>If I do this, will you help spread the word?</h5>

<p>Sure. We're always looking for new <a href="http://http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/case-studies/" target="_blank">case studies</a>. Give us an email and let us know what you've been working on: admin@creativecommons.org.nz</p>

<h5>Alice Meadows</h5>
<p>Although many publishers now offer authors some form of Open Access (OA), it’s probably fair to say that we did not exactly rush to embrace the open access (OA) model initially – not without reason, since there were, and in some respects still are, genuine concerns about the viability of OA both as a long-term, sustainable business model and as a way of ensuring the quality of scholarly articles. And, with online licenses and philanthropic deals ensuring wider access to scholarly content than ever before, it wasn’t clear that OA was really necessary.</p>
<p>However, in the last few years things have changed. A combination of factors – including declining library budgets while article submissions continue to increase; political pressure for free access to state-funded research articles (often conflated with access to the research itself) fanned by sometimes hostile media coverage; growing demand from authors; and, most recently, the introduction of mandated OA by the Research Councils UK – have forced publishers to open our eyes to OA as a business model. And, when we did, we discovered that OA offers many new opportunities for us, as well as real benefits for the scholarly and wider community.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it is now accepted that gold (author or funder pays) OA <em>can</em> be profitable. Whether you are a not-for-profit with a commitment to making your content openly available, or a commercial publisher in need of a sustainable business model that will deliver increased earnings per share – someone, somewhere, sometime is going to have to pay for the people, technology, and other resources needed in order for you to publish high-quality content. In the last few years, organizations as diverse the Public Library of Science (PLoS), one of the original OA publishers, and Springer, one of the world’s largest commercial publishers, have proved that gold OA is a viable business model. (<a href="http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2011/07/2010-plos-progress-update/">PLoS’s income exceeded its expenses for the first time in 2010</a>, while Springer’s Executive Vice President, Wim van der Stelt, told this year’s Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP) conference that his company wouldn’t be involved with OA publishing if it wasn’t at least as profitable as traditional subscription publishing.)</p>
<p>Second, contrary to the fears of some, gold OA doesn’t have to lead to a decline in quality. Just because payment for publishing services is being made by an author (or his/her funder) rather than by a library doesn’t mean that scholarly journals will start publishing bad science. Again PLoS provides a good example – <em>PloS Biology</em>, its first journal, has an impact factor of 11.452 in 2011, making it the top-ranked journal in ISI’s Biology category. Of course, there are plenty of OA journals where quality is an issue – just as there are subscription journals – but a continuing commitment to the peer review process should ensure the continuing high quality of top journals, irrespective of business model.</p>
<p>Third, the demand for access to content from across all regions and sectors continues to grow; to remain viable, publishers need to respond to this. A 2010 <a href="http://www.rin.ac.uk/node/1172">CIBER survey</a> found that 93% of respondents in universities and colleges believed research papers were easy or fairly easy to access, yet when asked to which of a range of resources they would most like to see access improved 38.5% identified journal articles as their first choice. Finding new ways to make the results of research more readily available to more people – inside and outside of the scholarly community – is a necessity, not a bonus.</p>
<p>Of course, OA is not without its challenges – and not just for publishers. Green (unfunded) OA, for example, is a real threat in some disciplines as seen by the results of <a href="http://www.publishingresearch.net/documents/ALPSPPApotentialresultsofsixmonthembargofv.pdf">an ALPSP survey of librarians</a> earlier this year, which found that 65% of respondents would cancel their subscriptions to some or all arts, social sciences, and humanities journals if they were freely available after a six-month embargo. Since green OA is effectively dependent on the continuation of subscription journals, widespread OA mandates would likely drive these journals – and potentially the communities they serve – out of existence, especially as these disciplines are often also unfunded and, therefore, unable to pay article publication charges (APCs).</p>
<p>Organizing payments for APCs is also likely to cause difficulties and disruption, at least in the short term. In the UK, it is unclear how the recent <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/RCUK%20_Policy_on_Access_to_Research_Outputs.pdf">Research Council UK (RCUK) mandate</a> will be implemented in practice – neither funders nor universities have systems or resources in place yet to manage this new process.</p>
<p>Another risk is that widely mandated gold OA could lead to a ‘race to the bottom’, with APCs being driven down to the point where the publishing process is no longer sustainable. Conversely, there could be pressure for journals either to increase APCs or to publish more articles (thereby potentially lowering the quality and Impact Factor) in order to maintain revenues.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for many scholarly publishers, 2012 may well be seen as the year that OA finally became mainstream. The opportunities are now widely believed to outweigh the risks; exciting new prospective services and products beckon; and a mixed economy, in which subscription journals, hybrid journals, and OA journals co-exist peacefully, is already becoming a reality – great news for authors, readers, and publishers alike. In future, let’s hope we can expand the focus from open access to open science by providing more and better access to summaries of research results (already required by funding agencies) and to the underlying data.</p>

<p>Here's something most of us can agree on: New Zealand culture is far more vibrant than the arts coverage of our major media organisations suggests. According to <a href="http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/assets/paperclip/publication_documents/documents/210/original/new_zealanders_and_the_arts_full_report_final_for_web.pdf?1338201080" target="_blank">a study by Creative New Zealand</a>, 80% of New Zealanders attended an arts event in 2011 (8). If we widen the range to 2008-2011, that figure rises to 95% (9). 87% agreed that "the arts are good for you"; 80% felt that "the arts help define who we are as New Zealanders" (16).</p>
<p>Good news, then: The arts in New Zealand are fairly strong, and, as the surveys from <a href="http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/assets/ckeditor/attachments/82/arts-survey-06.pdf?1296979201" target="_blank">2005</a> and <a href="http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/assets/ckeditor/attachments/17/new_zealanders_and_the_arts_-_attitudes_attendance_and_participation_in_2008.pdf" target="_blank">2008</a> suggest, they have been for a while now.</p>
<p>But while our attitudes to the arts might not be changing, the way our young people <em>participate</em> in the arts certainly is. As the authors conclude,</p>
<p></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Around four in every five (83%) young people that we surveyed said they have used a computer to create their own art in the past 12 months. Digital art has emerged as the artform that young people most want to be more involved with (9).</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, if we consider the population as a whole, the figure that has "used a computer to create an original work of art" drops to<em> 22%</em> (15).</p>
<p>It's common for older generations to see digital arts practice as a kind of fad and to dismiss terms like "remix," "tweak," &amp; "mashup" as nothing more than new media buzzwords; but these figures give some substance to the hype. According to Creative NZ, more kids want to 'mix &amp; mash' than act, or paint, or write. Far from being a fad, it seems more accurate to say that online remix culture is on its way to becoming the dominant mode of cultural expression in Aotearoa.</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSjs-5Yuto</p>
<p>[Manny's Story, by Casey Carsel, which won a <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/" target="_blank">Special Judges Award and Student Prize </a>in Digital NZ's Mix &amp; Mash 2011. Licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution</a>]</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that with the rise of e-books, online video streaming and digital music, all artforms will soon be digital, one way or another. This will make it much easier for New Zealanders to share, remix and reuse their culture. This has the potential to transform both the production <em>and </em>consumption of New Zealand art, as the capacity to spread artworks 'virally,' coupled with free editing tools, enables what we might pompously call the 'democratisation of culture.'</p>
<p>After all, imagine if 80% of New Zealands attended an arts event not once a year, but once a <em>month</em>?</p>
<p>Pompous or otherwise, the figures from CreativeNZ suggest that the next generation of New Zealanders will not see 'culture' or 'art' as the rarefied domain of specialists and professionals (most of them foreign). They will expect their culture to be both available and reusable.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this can occur while our culture is locked under All Rights Reserved -- at least not legally. At the same time, experience tells us that legal barriers are unlikely to stop young people from engaging in their artform of choice. What they are likely to do instead, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gomNxnoHG2U" target="_blank">as Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig spent many years pointing out</a>, is turn our young people into 'pirates' and 'infringers.'</p>
<p>With this in mind, it's clearly important to teach our young people about the enormous range of works already under a Creative Commons licence or in the public domain. But it's also important to expand the range of <em>contemporary</em> works available for sharing and reuse. Our young digital artists need to be able to engage with artworks from their own culture and society, so that they can join our artists in, as the Creative NZ report put it, "defining who we are as New Zealanders."</p>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-images/card-catalog/" rel="attachment wp-att-1905"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1905 " title="Card catalog" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Card-catalog-238x300.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="300"></a> Photograph of Card Catalog in Central Search Room, 1942,  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/usnationalarchives/3873932255/">US National Archives.</a> No Known Copyright.
<p>While there are dozens of search engines and repositories for Creative Commons content, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has a few favourites. This is what we use for our blog posts, slide shows and educational resources.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"> Flickr</h4>

<p>This is an obvious and popular choice: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> is a massive store of openly licensed photos from around the world. Currently, they have over 220 million photos using a Creative Commons licence. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/commons" target="_blank">Flickr Commons</a> has also partnered with dozens of public memory institutions from around the world, including NASA, the US National Archives and the National Library of New Zealand, to provide access to archival images.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Compfight</h4>

<p><a href="http://compfight.com/" target="_blank">Compfight</a> is an attractive, easy to use search engine. They make use of the Flickr API, which means that their search results will link back to photos found on Flickr.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Photopin</h4>

<p><a href="http://photopin.com/" target="_blank">Photopin</a> is one of my favourites. As with Compfight, the photos come from Flickr. The tool is incredibly easy to use, and the results page really is quite nice:</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-images/penguin-search-photopin-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-1910"><img class="wp-image-1910 aligncenter" title="penguin search photopin" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/penguin-search-photopin2.png" alt="" width="474" height="256"></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Open Clipart</h4>

<p><a href="http://openclipart.org/" target="_blank">Open Clipart</a> is the world's largest collaborative community to share, remix and reuse clipart. All of their images are released into the public domain. This means that you don't even need to provide attribution (though it's usually good manners to link back to the original).</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Wikimedia Commons</h4>

<p>If you're looking for paintings, drawings or older photography, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons </a>is your best bet. They have nearly 14 million media files that are either out of copyright or under a Creative Commons licence, including images from major international art galleries.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">The Noun Project</h4>

<p><a href="http://thenounproject.com/" target="_blank">The Noun Project</a> are new in town, but they've quickly developed a wide range of high quality icons and images for general reuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-images/noun-project/" rel="attachment wp-att-1911"><img class="wp-image-1911 aligncenter" title="Noun Project" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Noun-Project.png" alt="" width="633" height="216"></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"> Digital NZ</h4>

<p>We've saved the best for last: <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">Digital NZ's search engine</a>, which provides access to media from dozens of institutions from across New Zealand. If you want New Zealand content, this is the place to go. They also allow you to make shareable 'sets' of works you've found, to show off your weird and wonderful search results. <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/blog/posts/so-many-sets" target="_blank">Here's a list of the top 50 sets.</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Welcome to the first instalment of Friday Commons. I spend a lot of my time carping on about some of the great &amp; odd &amp; impossibly interesting material available for creative reuse. Sometimes I like to spread the word about <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/08/22/the-lancashire-witches-1612-2012/" target="_blank">witches</a>; at other times, I talk about <a href="http://t.co/w9ALCkuZ" target="_blank">poetry</a>, or <a href="http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/te-papa/" target="_blank">paintings</a>,or <a href="http://t.co/mttUKDfC" target="_blank">Pukeho</a>. I once linked to a <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/08/16/the-bestiarium-of-aloys-zotl-1831-1887/" target="_blank">Bestiarium</a>.</p>
<p>As all librarians and historians already know, the commons is a richer and stranger place than most of us ever suspected. So, why not bring some of this to the Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand website?</p>
<p>Let's get into it. First, we have The Walrus, from the nineteenth century Austrian painter Aloys Zötl, part of his <em>Bestiarium</em>. Read more about it at <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/08/16/the-bestiarium-of-aloys-zotl-1831-1887/" target="_blank"><em>The Public Domain Review</em></a>. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/friday-commons-1/769px-aloys_zotl_der_see-elefant-the-walrus/" rel="attachment wp-att-1840"><img class="wp-image-1840 aligncenter" title="769px-Aloys_Zötl,_Der_See-Elefant -- The Walrus" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/769px-Aloys_Z%C3%B6tl_Der_See-Elefant-The-Walrus-300x234.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="275"></a></p>
<p>While I'm looting material from The Public Domain Review, I'll point you to the spectacularly titled <em><a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924021236017#page/n11/mode/2up" target="_blank">The Criminal Prosecution and Capital Punishment of Animals</a></em>, 1906, by EP Evans. That link takes you to the whole book, which you can read, if you'd like. For now, though, I'll give you this: 'Trial of a Sow and Pigs at Lavegny,' from <em>The Book of Days</em> (1863) edited by Robert Chambers<em></em>, found in <a href="http://http://publicdomainreview.org/2011/03/27/bugs-and-beasts-before-the-law/" target="_blank">Nicholas Humphrey's great piece on animals on trial</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/friday-commons-1/sow-at-court-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1857"><img class="size-full wp-image-1857 aligncenter" title="Sow at Court" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Sow-at-Court1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="352"></a></p>
<p>This next image is from the Auckland Weekly News, September 3, 1908. Its title is "Hunting the King of Beasts: A Platform Erected in the African Jungle from Which to Shoot Lions." Very descriptive. This work is in the public domain, and is available <a href="http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?BU=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aucklandcity.govt.nz%2Fdbtw-wpd%2FHeritageImages%2Findex.htm&amp;AC=QBE_QUERY&amp;TN=heritageimages&amp;QF0=ID&amp;NP=2&amp;MR=5&amp;RF=HIORecordSearch&amp;QI0=%3D%22AWNS-19080903-12-1%22" target="_blank">from Auckland City Libraries</a>. I found it using <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">Digital NZ</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/friday-commons-1/awns_19080903_p012_i001_x/" rel="attachment wp-att-1851"><img class="wp-image-1851 aligncenter" title="AWNS_19080903_p012_i001_x" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/AWNS_19080903_p012_i001_x-743x1024.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="691"></a></p>
<p><a title="w:Allocamelus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allocamelus">Allocamelus</a> here is from Topsell's <em>The History of Four-footed Beasts and Serpents</em>, 1658. This image is in the public domain, and can be found in the Special Collections of the <a href="http://info.lib.uh.edu/sca/digital/beast/reproductions.html" target="_blank">University of Houston Libraries</a>. I found it on <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/friday-commons-1/allocamelus_from_topsells_the_history_of_four-footed_beasts_and_serpents/" rel="attachment wp-att-1843"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1843 aligncenter" title="Allocamelus_from_Topsell's_The_History_of_Four-footed_Beasts_and_Serpents" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Allocamelus_from_Topsells_The_History_of_Four-footed_Beasts_and_Serpents-300x290.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="290"></a></p>
<p>That's enough for now. If you have anything comparably odd you'd like to share, throw a link in the comments. And if you like the idea of collecting images under various themes, <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">go to Digital NZ and make a set</a>.</p>

<em>This post was originally published in the August 27 print edition of the Gazette Focus, a supplement to the <a href="http://www.edgazette.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Education Gazette</a></em>.
<p>In 2013, the Ministry of Education will begin to roll out <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/EducationInitiatives/UFBInSchools.aspx" target="_blank">Ultra Fast Broadband in the Network for Learning (N4L)</a>. This will give teachers and students ‘ultra fast’ access to a global archive of digital educational resources. Ultra fast connection speeds will help New Zealand teachers do what they do best: teach New Zealand kids to understand and critique our rich cultural and intellectual heritage.</p>
<p>This is a truly exciting development. Teachers will be able to easily share, remix and reuse resources; students will be able to critically engage with an extraordinary range of online materials. There is enormous potential for collaboration between schools across New Zealand.</p>
<p>But what about when the tools of the trade—the educational resources themselves—are locked under copyright? This is notoriously murky territory. While teachers have some <a href="http://www.copyright.org.nz/viewInfosheet.php?sheet=439" target="_blank">special permissions under the Copyright Act</a>, they do not have the right to adapt and re-release copyright materials.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/understand-and-teach-creative-commons/creativecommonskiwi/" rel="attachment wp-att-1590"><img class=" wp-image-1590 alignright" title="creativecommonskiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/creativecommonskiwi.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="302"></a> With such uncertainties, teachers may decide not to risk adapting and sharing resources across the N4L. This threatens to undermine the purpose of the N4L itself, which is intended, <a href="http://www.edgazette.govt.nz/Articles/Article.aspx?ArticleId=8561" target="_blank">as the <em>Education Gazette </em>reported in April</a>, “to encourage collaboration and sharing of resources and knowledge between school communities and learners around New Zealand.”</p>
<p>This is where Creative Commons can help. The Creative Commons licences are robust legal tools that enable users to share, remix and reuse copyright materials; they are quickly applied and easily understood. From a suite of six licences, copyright holders choose from a series of licence conditions. The more restrictive licences prevent derivative works and commercial reuse; the most open licence allows users to adapt, remix and share materials as they wish, as long as they credit the original work.</p>
<p>Realising the potential of digital technologies, some New Zealand schools have decided to adopt <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank">a Creative Commons policy</a>. This automatically grants a Creative Commons licence to all educational materials produced in the school. Teachers are then free to adapt and share their resources without having to ask copyright holders—that is, their Boards of Trustees—for permission.</p>
<p>These schools are well placed under current Government policy. <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/nzgoal/quick-guide-agencies" target="_blank">The New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework (NZGOAL)</a>, approved by Cabinet on 5 July 2010, invites Boards of Trustees to consider using Creative Commons licences for their teaching resources.</p>
<p>The educational benefits are clear. Since <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/" target="_blank">Albany Senior High School adopted their Creative Commons policy</a>, Deputy Principal Mark Osbourne has noticed that “teachers are collaborating more, and they’re also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources.”</p>
<p>In taking this step, the teachers of ASHS join a thriving culture of sharing, remix and reuse already embraced by many kiwi students. Adopting a Creative Commons policy, and working with Creative Commons resources, is also good way to educate students about copyright, so that they can stop infringing and start creating.</p>
<p>The commons is growing: There are already between 500 and 700 million Creative Commons licensed resources available for sharing and reuse, and this is growing every day. Institutions using Creative Commons include Wikipedia, The White House and the governments of Australia, New Zealand and the UK.</p>
<p>You can help expand the commons by reusing, remixing and sharing Creative Commons licensed resources. For more information on the licences, as well links to our Creative Commons video, brochure, poster and slideshow presentation, visit us at creativecommons.org.nz.</p>

<p>In 2008, Matthew Poole posted a short piece on a talk by Lawrence Lessig on Russell Brown's <a href="http://publicaddress.net/" target="_blank">Public Address</a> website, and thus spawned what would come to be known as <a href="http://publicaddress.net/speaker/copyright-must-change/"> The Great Copyright Thread of Doom</a>. Spanning "<a href="http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/nethui-its-all-about-you/" target="_blank">89 pages</a>, 2202 comments and [a] dozen or so separate flame wars," the thread captured the <em>sturm und drang</em> typical of many online copyright debates.</p>
<p>While the thread, in all its novelistic glory, covered a range of issues, one of the more tempestuous topics was that of compensation: To wit, if New Zealand artists use open licences, how are they supposed to make a living?</p>
<p>By way of response, many Creative Commons supporters tend to riff on that famous aphorism of <a href="http://openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2002/12/11/piracy.html" target="_blank">Tim O'Reilly</a>, arguing that obscurity is a far greater threat to New Zealand artists than misuse or piracy. Others outline new 'business models' for artists, made possible by dwindling costs of production and distribution.</p>
<p>While it can be fun and enlightening to dive into the murk of online copyright debate, it's worth pointing out that the idea of New Zealand artists using Creative Commons licences to share their work is not some futuristic, speculative fantasy. In fact, a bunch of New Zealand artists having been doing so for a while now.</p>
<p>As many of you know, <a title="Bronwyn Holloway-Smith" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/bronwyn-holloway-smith/" target="_blank">Bronwyn Holloway-Smith</a> and <a title="Culture" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/culture/" target="_blank">Jem Yoshioka </a>both use Creative Commons licences. Other artists that have featured on Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand include <a title="Luke Rowell DISASTERADIO" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/03/luke-rowell-disasteradio/" target="_blank">Disasteradio</a> and <a title="Knives at Noon" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2008/08/knives-at-noon/" target="_blank">Knives at Noon</a>.</p>

<p>People at Te Papa have been thinking about Creative Commons licensing for a while now. As our national museum, Te Papa is the kaitiaki of an incredible range of artistic, scientific and cultural items, including paintings, photos, objects, specimens articles and over thirty thousand Taonga Māori treasures.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/objimage/" rel="attachment wp-att-1728"><img class=" wp-image-1728 " title="objimage" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/objimage-286x300.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="231"></a> <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/ObjectDetails.aspx?oid=225159&amp;coltype=Birds&amp;regno=OR.023944">Kea, Nestor notabilis</a> collected September 1987, Otira, Westland, New Zealand.

<p>A decade ago, these collections were difficult for most New Zealanders to access, especially for those who lived outside of Wellington. Since then, the team at Te Papa has been working on digitising their collection of over 2 million items. In 2005, after years of work, Te Papa launched <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Collections Online</a>, a search engine for Te Papa's collections; it was relaunched in its current format in 2009.</p>
<p>As Adrian Kingston, Collections Information Manager for Digital Assets and Development, wrote <a href="posts/2012/08/30/blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2009/06/11/te-papas-collections-and-digitisation/" target="_blank">at the time</a>, "Te Papa’s collections have been built over nearly 150 years and range from miniscule <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=136235">lice </a>and <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=159261">molluscs </a>through to <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=626335">caravans</a>, <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=38080">22m long artworks</a> and <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?term=colossal&amp;imagesonly=on">colossal squid</a>... A collection this diverse can create a number of headaches when it comes to digitisation."</p>
<p>Some of these headaches are technical; others are legal. Before any item can be reproduced online, the team at Te Papa have to figure out if they have the right to do so. This can be an arduous process. As a result, as Victoria Leachman, Rights Manager at Te Papa, puts it, “our focus at Te Papa has been on accessibility, rather than reuse."</p>
<p>The result, though, is an outstanding digital archive, currently consisting of over 200 000 objects. This is a fantastic resources for students, researchers and members of the public.</p>
<p>In a digital environment, however, many visitors to Te Papa's collections want to share, remix and reuse the images and data they find. Recognising this, Victoria and her team have been steadily applying Creative Commons licences to thousands of items. The team, as Victoria puts it, has been “nibbling away at the edges of the collections."</p>

Keulemans, 1872. New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. No known copyright restrictions. (O.009829)</p>
<p>In 2008, as an initial experiment with open licensing, Te Papa applied a Creative Commons licence to 21 audio guides for its <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/ritaangus/downloads.aspx" target="_blank">Rita Angus: Life and Vision exhib</a><a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/ritaangus/downloads.aspx" target="_blank">ition</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, applying Creative Commons licences has been a work in progress. Because Te Papa doesn’t always own the copyright to its collections, the process of giving Creative Commons licenses can be complex. The team at Te Papa has spent six years researching the copyright on its images.</p>
<p>Te Papa itself also produces a vast amount of material. These images have been easier to license: So far, thousands of images in its <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/theme.aspx?irn=2848" target="_blank">Natural Environment Collections</a> have been given a Creative Commons licence, such as Kea, Nestor Notabilis, above. Thousands of other works have been labelled 'no known copyright restrictions,' which lets users know that to the knowledge of Te Papa, the work has fallen into the public domain.</p>
<p>The team has already seen some exciting example of reuse, including posts in Dr David's Winter's <a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/the-atavism/2012/08/05/sunday-spinelessness-how-snails-conquered-the-land-again-and-again/" target="_blank">The Atavism</a>, hosted by <a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/" target="_blank">Sciblogs</a>.</p>
<p>Other works from Te Papa can be found in its <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tepapa/" target="_blank">Flickr stream</a>. Te Papa also holds the copyright to a few of the objects in its art collections, allowing it to participate in the <a href="http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/te-papa/" target="_blank">Google Art Project</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to its images and artworks, Te Papa produces a vast amount of original research. Like other organisations, Te Papa is confronting the trend towards open access. In 2011, researchers from Te Papa published a paper in <em>Scientific Reports</em> on the "slime defence mechanism" of the Hagfish. The researchers licensed the paper Creative Commons BY-NC-ND, and made it available on <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/2011/111027/srep00131/full/srep00131.html" target="_blank">Nature.com</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/te-papa-image/" rel="attachment wp-att-1738"><img class=" wp-image-1738 " title="Te Papa image" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Te-Papa-image.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="231"></a> <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/ObjectDetails.aspx?oid=112618&amp;coltype=Photography&amp;regno=C.001444">Lava flow from the eruption of the Matavanu Volcano on Savai'i</a> by Thomas Andrews 1905-1910, New Zealand.

<p>They also released, as the wonderful press release put it, "graphic underwater footage showing for the first time how the primitive hagfish – also known as the snot-eel – defends itself by emitting a choking, gill-clogging slime." Because both the paper and the footage were available under an open licence, the findings were covered by news organisations like TVNZ and <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDIQqQIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stuff.co.nz%2Fnational%2F5868827%2FAmazing-footage-How-the-hagfish-repels-predators%2F&amp;ei=ipY-UOiyNofzmAWCtICADQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7Ba6mBvax-wC5SpMgNaRPgkFPnQ&amp;sig2=BLJnyMbcoj4nF6PQodQl8A" target="_blank">Stuff.co.nz</a>.</p>
<p>Victoria and Adrian both acknowledge that there is still a lot of work to do. Currently, Collections Online doesn’t allow users to filter by license type, meaning that it can be hard to find content licensed under Creative Commons.There is also work to do in making it easier to download low resolution images for non-commercial use from the website.</p>
<p>Te Papa uses a BY-NC-ND copyright license as the museum charges for commercial use of its images through the Te Papa Picture Library.</p>
<p>There are also issues of moral rights, cultural rights and 'orphan works,' those works that are still under copyright but that have no obvious copyright owner. Victoria and others at Te Papa are working on addressing these issues, while respecting the rights of those who donate their collections.</p>
<p>In working towards open licensing, Te Papa joins a host of museums and art galleries from around the world. Notable examples of institutions using Creative Commons licenses include the <a href="http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/free-download-of-art-works/" target="_blank">The National Gallery of Denmark</a>, <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/" target="_blank">The National Portrait Gallery</a> in the UK, and <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/copyright.php" target="_blank">Brooklyn Museum</a> in the US. In May of this year, <a href="http://thewalters.org/news/releases/pressdetail.aspx?e_id=385" target="_blank">Walters Art Museum</a> uploaded over 19 000 openly licensed images of artworks to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Collections_of_the_Walters_Art_Museum" target="_blank">Wikimedia</a>.</p>
