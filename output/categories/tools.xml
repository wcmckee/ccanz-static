&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) is the kaitiaki of the Creative Commons (CC) licences in Aotearoa New Zealand. We provide free legal tools that help people release their works for others to share and reuse, in order to grow the commons, that store of works freely available to access and reuse. Learn more at &lt;a title="Home" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/"&gt;creativecommons.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Creative Commons Licences and Māori Works&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CC licences are not always considered appropriate for Māori cultural works. CC licences cannot be applied to works that no longer qualify for copyright protection, which is likely to be true of many older Māori works. Also, the licences do not provide protections against culturally offensive or otherwise inappropriate uses of Māori works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Free Legal Notice for Māori Works&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, CCANZ is looking to produce a free legal notice that Māori can use to release cultural works more openly. The notice will be a clear and standard expression of the freedoms and restrictions that cultural producers or kaitiaki of Māori cultural works wish to apply. While the notice cannot grant additional legal protections, it will aim to educate the public about the status of Māori works, while at the same time allowing for greater access, sharing and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why a 'Notice' and not a 'Licence'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 'licence' is based on rights that are legally recognised, and full legal recognition of rights to mātauranga Māori and taonga works does not yet exist. A 'notice' will help to ensure that members of the public are aware of the status of a particular work, and also know how to share and reuse it appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How Will It Work?

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the details are yet to be determined, it is likely that a statement and symbol would be attached to a work. These would, in turn, link to a standard, legally robust statement of the freedoms and restrictions that the work's kaitiaki wish to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;More Information&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without sharing, there is no education”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– David Wiley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As anyone who works in education knows, all teachers share and collaborate. From swapping lesson plans to re&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CC-brochure.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4925" alt="CC brochure" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CC-brochure-300x274.png" width="300" height="274"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;using  assignments, teachers are constantly looking to make better resources by building on each other’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this is getting easier. With the Internet and digital technologies, there is a much wider pool of teachers to collaborate with— and, in turn, a much richer range of reusable digital resources. With over 2,500 schools and 53,000 teachers working in New Zealand state funded schools, the potential is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Copyright&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, the copyright in resources made by most kiwi teachers in the course of their employment is held by their respective Boards of Trustees (their employers.) Legally, this means that teachers have to ask permission from their Board of Trustees before they can share their resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more teaching and learning is done online, it’s essential that teachers have permission to legally share and collaborate. This is why Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, following the lead of NZGOAL, is recommending that each Board of Trustees adopt a Creative Commons policy giving all school teachers advance permission to legally share their resources for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;NZGOAL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approved by Cabinet in July 2010, NZGOAL (the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework) advocates the use of Creative Commons licences for copyright works released by State Services agencies, including New Zealand schools.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons is an international non-profit, with projects in over seventy countries. Creative Commons provides free, legally robust licences that allow copyright owners to give permission for their work to be shared and reused. A Creative Commons licence tells other people what they can do with your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons licences are being used everywhere—from the White House and Wikipedia to the New Zealand Government—to enable content and data to be shared and reused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creative Commons Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Creative Commons policy approved by your Board of Trustees will enable teachers at your school to share their teaching resources under a Creative Commons licence. A Creative Commons policy will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Encourage teachers at your school to legally share and collaborate online;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Ensure that when teachers leave, both the teacher and the school retain access to all teaching resources;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Enable NZ teachers to spend more time adapting high quality resources, and less time reinventing the wheel.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Teachers are collaborating more, and they’re also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources.” – Mark Osborne,  Albany Senior High School&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by Erika Pearson, Richard White and Simon Hart at the University of Otago – with assistance from Bernard Madill – the open textbook project will be an experiment in the production of open educational resources in Aotearoa New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was inspired by a group of Finnish mathematicians who (successfully) attempted to write&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34643" target="_blank"&gt; an open mathematics textbook in a weekend.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An 'open' textbook is one which is free of all technical and legal restrictions on access and reuse. That means a textbook that is free to read, free to adapt and free to distribute – all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This initial textbook project will be for undergraduate students in Communication and Media Studies around Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific. In the future, though, we could see open textbook projects for subjects and levels across the New Zealand education system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, the organising team are producing an accompanying 'cookbook'' to provide a roadmap for other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is partially funded by Creative Commons, who have been supporting open education projects around the world. Creative Commons affiliates, for their part, have been working to implement open education projects and policies -- with a great deal of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CCvid.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-4882 alignright" alt="CCvid" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CCvid-300x253.jpg" width="199" height="167"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In Latin America, &lt;a href="http://www.latinproject.org/index.php/en/project-overview" target="_blank"&gt;Project LATIN&lt;/a&gt; is working to produce open textbooks to address the affordability of educational resources. As the project home points out, annual textbook costs for an undergraduate at the Universidade de São Paulo add up to 67% of the Brazilian minimum wage. "This," the members of Project LATIN point out, "makes [it] almost impossible for low-income families to support university study."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the &lt;a href="http://oerpolicy.eu/reflections-on-our-oer-policy-workshop-in-berlin/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Education Policy Network&lt;/a&gt; is making the case to governments across the continent that free content licences -- like CC BY or CC BY SA -- "should be adopted for all publicly funded educational content." Projects are already in place: &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.pl/open-educational-resources-in-the-digital-school-program/" target="_blank"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and Macedonia have been producing state-funded open textbooks for the compulsory sector, and other countries have developed repositories for open educational resources, like the Belgian &lt;a href="http://klascement.info/"&gt;Klascement&lt;/a&gt;, Dutch &lt;a href="http://www.wikiwijs.nl/"&gt;Wikiwijs&lt;/a&gt; and Norwegian &lt;a href="http://ndla.no/"&gt;NDLA. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 13, the Indian Government launched &lt;a href="http://nroer.in/home/" target="_blank"&gt;NROER&lt;/a&gt;, a repository for providing open educational resources for the Indian school sector. in Mongolia, &lt;a href="http://www.one.mn/" target="_blank"&gt;the One Academy&lt;/a&gt; is translating and creating open resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In North America, &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34288" target="_blank"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34566" target="_blank"&gt; British Columbia&lt;/a&gt; have both announced plans to use open textbooks for high enrolment courses. And then the Department of Labor and the Department of Educationin the US announced $2 billion to create open educational resources for US community colleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, the &lt;a href="http://oeruniversity.org/"&gt;Open Educational Resources university has launched&lt;/a&gt;, which uses open textbooks to teach -- and provide credit -- for university courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that really is just the beginning: there are major open educational resources projects in just about every country on the planet. Open textbooks are clearly taking off -- and for good reason. Open textbooks ensure that educational resources are accessible, affordable and reusable, helping organisations and governments to realise their basic goal of enabling universal access to education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's exciting to see the global movement for open textbooks reach New Zealand. May this open textbook project be the first of many!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Education</category><category>Events</category><category>Tools</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/11/11/hacking-a-media-text-in-a-weekend.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2013 02:24:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Review Is the Key to Open Access</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/10/25/review-is-the-key-to-open-access.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;By Andrew Preston, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://publons.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Publons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A favourite ploy among unsolicited email advertising, that bane of the connected world, is the offer of instant degrees conferred by bogus institutions. Easy to get, sure, but unlikely to get you far in a competitive job market. In short, where you got your degree matters. Reputation is everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same in the world of academic publishing. Peer-review serves an essential role as the gatekeeper to research. Scientists evaluate the work of their peers to make sure the work is sound. Where you get your paper published matters too. This second layer of evaluation – and reputation – is added by the exclusivity (and impact factor) of the publication itself. The system is designed to give academics greater confidence in the published literature they choose to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[quote float="right"]The traditional approach serves to limit discussion and debate[/quote]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a system that has continued more or less unchanged and unchallenged for centuries. While, in the last few years, the internet has transformed virtually every publishing industry, there has been little experiment or innovation in the way academic research is communicated and evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open access movement has challenged the traditional academic journal model on a single front: publication. While open access has made it easier for people to access a wider range of material, the issue of evaluation remains. In this critical area, traditional journals still hold all the cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue was highlighted by John Bohannon’s recent &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60" target="_blank"&gt;open access journal sting&lt;/a&gt;. Bohannon submitted versions of a fake paper to 304 open access journals. This paper was so flawed that no journal should have accepted it, and yet more than half did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to blame the open access model for this, but that’s not the problem. We need to focus on the evaluation process -- the peer-review. Reviewing is a necessary but thankless task. Reviewers get no credit for their time and effort. Journals struggle to find qualified reviewers who don’t have conflicts of interest. As a result, the review process can take months, slowing down the dissemination of research it is designed to facilitate. And, as Bohannon showed, that’s only if it’s done well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach serves to limit discussion and debate. There is no inherent reason that only one or two experts in a field should determine the validity of a paper, nor that their evaluations be kept secret. There is plenty of valuable knowledge out there in the heads of experts. We just need to figure out how to get it on the web, because if we succeed at that we strengthen the case for open access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts with giving reviewers credit for their work. There are many ways to do this. One approach is to turn review into a publication itself. We’ve recently &lt;a href="http://blog.publons.com/post/61380784056/announcing-doi-support-for-reviews" target="_blank"&gt;begun allocating&lt;/a&gt; Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) to reviews performed on Publons.com, making them citable contributions to the scientific literature. While DOIs are standard for published articles and datasets, the application of DOIs to peer review is a world first. Effectively, this puts reviews on the same footing as publications. For academics, it means they can augment their publication record with a portfolio of reviews. This record can be used to strengthen applications for funding and jobs, and to collaborate in the academic community on a deeper level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not the only ones working to open up peer review. A number of interesting startups have begun to work in this space. PeerJ, PubPeer, Libre, F1000, Axios Review, PeerEvaluation, Rubriq, The Winnower, and Peerage of Science have all announced initiatives focused on improving review. These range from new publishing models, to post-publication review platforms, to peer-review as a service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an open access world to succeed we need our gatekeepers. We need to make sure they get ‘paid’. Giving peer reviewers recognition and credit for their indispensable contributions to science provides a greater incentive for them to contribute high-quality, timely reviews. The payoff for everyone is better debate, greater transparency and the enhanced reputation of open access material, leading ultimately to faster and better communication of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamendo is one of the largest open music sites out there. The site lets you filter by genre; it also ranks tracks according to their popularity. Before you share or reuse a track from Jamendo, be sure to check out the licence at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bandcamp is a site used by many musicians to share and sell their music. The great thing about Bandcamp is that it often gives you the option of &lt;em&gt;paying&lt;/em&gt; the musician. Here's a link to artists tagged &lt;a href="http://bandcamp.com/tag/creative-commons" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;. You'll be able to tell which licence each artist uses by the small symbols at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last two years, the National Library of New Zealand has released its own Creative Commons mixtapes, pieced together from legal deposits to their digital music collection. You can check out the latest mix-tape, and also peruse a master-list of CC-licensed albums. While you're in the mood for mix-tapes, you can also &lt;a title="The Creative Commons Playlist" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/05/the-creative-commons-playlist/" target="_blank"&gt;check out our own&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Culture</category><category>Tools</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/07/25/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-music.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2013 21:03:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Wikihouse NZ</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/05/28/wikihouse-nz.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wikihouse.cc/" target="_blank"&gt;WikiHouse&lt;/a&gt; is an ambitious global open hardware project that aims to “allow anyone to design, download and ‘print’ CNC-milled houses and components, which can be assembled with minimal formal skill or training.”
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://thinkradical.net/" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand’s WikiHouse Lab&lt;/a&gt; was formed by Martin Luff and Danny Squires, who discovered the idea after the second &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Christchurch_earthquake" target="_blank"&gt;Canterbury earthquake&lt;/a&gt; in February 2011. As Martin puts it, “Danny and myself were trying to find a solution to a whole number of different issues in the built environment. We spent about six months researching different systems. During that process, a friend tipped us off to the WikiHouse project.”&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wikihouse-logo-lg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright  wp-image-3881" title="wikihouse-logo-lg" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wikihouse-logo-lg.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Canterbury earthquakes, over 6100 businesses were displaced from the central city. “Only about ten of those have gone back to their original location,” Martin says. “The rest needed to relocate somewhere else. We were looking for a system whereby, in the worst case scenario, within a few weeks you could relocate your business and be back up in running.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin and Danny were also keen to empower the local community. “A lot of people down here in Canterbury are stuck in limbo because they are dependent on a whole hierarchy of other agencies before they can get on with things like repairs and replacement housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One particular thing we were looking for was a system that allowed people to be involved right from the get-go, through the whole design process, right the way to implementation. One of the really nice things about WikiHouse is that the people can really assemble the things on the ground themselves, as well being involved in the whole design process along the way. One of the main things we looking at was empowerment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Martin explains, WikiHouse could also make housing more affordable. With WikiHouse, young people looking to enter the housing market would be able to start small, and be able to expand when they need to. Parents with large houses would also be able to break off sections of their house, to pass on to their children as a ‘starter-kit’—a form of “hand-me-down housing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin and Danny also wanted to ensure that what they produced was healthier, stronger and more environmentally friendly than the current housing stock. “We wanted it to be world-class in terms of its ability to stand up to seismic resistance. We also wanted it, longer-term, to go beyond sustainability to something that could be restorative to our environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P1060157sb-small.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-3882 " title="P1060157sb-small" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P1060157sb-small.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wikihouse NZ at the Makertorium at Te Papa, 27 April 2013, via &lt;a href="http://thinkradical.net/" target="_blank"&gt;WikihouseNZ/SpaceCraft&lt;/a&gt;. Used with permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons licensing is a core part of WikiHouse. As Martin explains, “Creative Commons is essential to the whole WikiHouse project. There are &lt;a href="http://www.wikihouse.cc/guide" target="_blank"&gt;ten core principles&lt;/a&gt;, and principle number one is be lazy like a fox. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Copy, adapt, give credit and share.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons licensing enables WikiHouse teams from around the world to collaborate and improve on each other’s designs. By way of example, Martin explains that the initial WikiHouse design “had a lot of mechanical fixings in it. A collective design effort quickly eliminated the need for those. The system we’ve got at the moment can be put together without power tools, by unskilled people in a very short length of time. There are no mechanical fixings in it, no bolts or screws or glue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, Martin sees WikiHouse taking off through a series of local projects, “probably neighbourhood based manufacturing plants, where local people can drop in, not just to build buildings, but all sorts of other things as well.” This global network of community-based organisations is where Creative Commons licensing becomes important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We really see this as a social enterprise, and it’s only going to work if we can deliver on scale—very large scale. One of the workshops we’re setting up in the WikiHouse project is in Rio. The global perspective on the project is that in the next 40 to 50 years, if the projections hold true, then we’ve got to built as much urban development globally as currently is in existence. This is mind-boggling. We can’t do that with conventional building techniques or without openly working together on solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, WikiHouse Rio won part of the &lt;a href="http://blog.ted.com/2013/02/27/8-great-ideas-for-cities-the-city-2-0-award-winners-in-video/" target="_blank"&gt;TED City Prize 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, for its project setting up an “open source maker lab in the heart of the &lt;em&gt;favela&lt;/em&gt;.” With its Creative Commons licence, this project could potentially be duplicated—and improved—in other cities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I see it, if you’re shutting away that information, the things that you learn, then it’s essentially a waste-stream. It seems critical that, as far as possible, you’re open. If you take the bigger picture, it can seem a bit petty to fence that knowledge away, and charge people to access it; especially since any new idea only ever builds incrementally on all the knowledge and wisdom that went before. Creative Commons seems like a great way to acknowledge that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source hardware, however, is still a new concept, especially for highly-regulated industries like construction. “It’s much trickier to get the globally distributed network right, especially when it’s a mix of professionals and amateurs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, Danny and Martin, along with the founding WikiHouse team in the UK, are looking to have a finished house by the end of the year. “That’s one of the beauties of a large, open source project: It’s surprising how quickly it can progress.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;What is a Creative Commons Policy?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Creative Commons policy enables all teachers within a school to share their teaching resources under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. This means that they can legally share and collaborate with other New Zealand teachers, without having to ask permission from their Board of Trustees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What is Creative Commons?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons provides free, simple to use and legally robust licences, to enable people to easily share and reuse copyright material. &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;The six main Creative Commons licences&lt;/a&gt; give a range of permissions, from more free to more restrictive. The more restrictive licences prevent derivative works and commercial reuse; the most open licence allows users to adapt, remix and share materials as they wish, as long as they credit the original work. &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782"&gt;Our video&lt;/a&gt; provides a quick and easy explanation of the licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Why can't teachers decide to use Creative Commons for themselves?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The copyright to all resources made by teachers in the course of their employment is held by their employer--i.e., their Board of Trustees. In order to avoid infringing copyright, teachers technically have to ask their BoTs for permission before they share resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Why do teachers need to share?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all classrooms are different, many teachers around the country are facing similar challenges. Creative Commons licences allow teachers to reuse resources from other New Zealand teachers and adapt them to their specific classroom situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;the six main Creative Commons licences&lt;/a&gt; all require users to provide attribution, teachers will receive credit when their high-quality resources are used by others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What will the policy achieve?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cc.large_.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-2249 alignright" title="cc.large" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cc.large_-300x300.png" alt="" width="180" height="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Beyond enabling teachers to legally share resources and collaborate, Creative Commons policies have been found to contribute to wider cultural change within schools. &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/" target="_blank"&gt;Albany Senior High School, for instance, found that&lt;/a&gt; "teachers are collaborating more, and they’re also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy will also introduce the issue of copyright and open licensing to both teachers and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Why now?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of Ultra Fast Broadband and hand-held devices, it has become extremely easy to copy and reuse material found online. However, this also means that it is become easy for everyone--including students and teachers--to unintentionally violate copyright. It is more important than ever for both students and teachers to know about copyright, as well as free and legal alternatives like Creative Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What is the New Zealand Government's position on Creative Commons licensing?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Government Open Access Licensing framework (NZGOAL)&lt;/a&gt; was approved by Cabinet on 5 July 2010, to guide public agencies in their release of materials for creative reuse. Where appropriate, NZGOAL recommends that public agencies apply &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Creative Commons-Attribution licences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzgoal.info/quick-guides/quick-guide-for-agencies/" target="_blank"&gt;Under the current framework&lt;/a&gt;, NZGOAL “invites school boards of trustees... to take NZGOAL into account when releasing copyright material and non-copyright material to the public for re-use.” By adopting a Creative Commons policy, schools will find themselves in line with government policy, and will be well placed for any further developments in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-3530 alignleft" title="Remix Kiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="218"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What about when teachers leave?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Creative Commons policy will ensure that when  teachers move to a new school, both the teacher and the school can retain access to all teaching resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Will the policy mean that the school gives up its copyright?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not at all. The Creative Commons licences simply mean that the school gives permission for others to share and reuse its copyright works. There are six Creative Commons licences, ranging from more free to more restrictive. &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;Learn more about the licences here&lt;/a&gt;; or, alternatively, watch &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782" target="_blank"&gt;this short video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Who has a Creative Commons policy?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons policies have been adopted at &lt;a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/"&gt;Albany Senior High School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Warrington School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/warrington-school/"&gt;Warrington School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Wellington High School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/12/wellington-high-school/"&gt;Wellington High School&lt;/a&gt; and Tawa Intermediate. Follow those links for detailed case studies on their use of Creative Commons. Many other schools are in the process of adopting a Creative Commons policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;How much does it cost?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand provides its licences free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Will I have to write my policy from scratch?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Albany Senior High School has kindly &lt;a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank"&gt;made its policy available under a Creative Commons Attribution licence&lt;/a&gt;. This means that all schools are free to adapt and reuse the policy for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What do I do next?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Learn more about Creative Commons licensing. Talk with teachers and about copyright and Creative Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Draft your policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Take your policy to your Board of Trustees for approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Begin sharing your educational resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What if I want to teach Creative Commons licensing to my students?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside education on copyright, plagiarism and privacy, Creative Commons has become an integral part of good digital citizenship. To support efforts by teachers to introduce Creative Commons licensing to students, we've developed a range of resources. &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782"&gt;Our video &lt;/a&gt;is the best introduction to the licences themselves. This short &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Free-to-Mix.pdf"&gt;Free to Mix guide (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; is a simple introduction copyright, Creative Commons and how to find and use Creative Commons material. &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/A2-finals.2.pdf"&gt;Stick up this poster (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; in the classroom, as a reference tool for the different licence types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this more interesting, encourage your students to enter &lt;a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/"&gt;Mix &amp;amp; Mash: The New Storytelling&lt;/a&gt;, organised by Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, the National Library and DigitalNZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Can you come and talk about Creative Commons licensing?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure. &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/contact/" target="_blank"&gt;Get in touch&lt;/a&gt; and we'll work something out--either in person, over videoconference or Skype. In the meantime, &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MattMcGregor/creative-commons-for-schools"&gt;this slideshow&lt;/a&gt; introduces some of the issues around copyright and Creative Commons licensing in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Education</category><category>Tools</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/03/20/creative-commons-policies-for-schools.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 21:18:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>7 Ways To Find Creative Commons Video</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/03/13/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-video.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Quicksand_pic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-3553" title="Quicksand_pic" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Quicksand_pic.jpg" alt="" width="418" height="314"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Still from 'Quicksand,' 1950, directed by Irving Pichel, starring Mickey Rooney, &lt;a href="http://archive.org/details/Quicksand_clear/"&gt;via The Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. This film is in the public domain.
&lt;p&gt;While many people know about Creative Commons and public domain images, fewer people know about the vast range of high quality Creative Commons videos, available to be shared, remixed and reused. Here are some of the best ways to find clips or movies that are either licensed under Creative Commons or in the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;Youtube&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, no video list would go far without including Youtube. Check out Youtube's own &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/creativecommons" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons corner&lt;/a&gt;; otherwise, add a Creative Commons filter to your search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/creativecommons" target="_blank"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt; has over two million openly licensed videos. Happily, Vimeo also sort their videos according to the terms of the Creative Commons licence, which makes it easy for you to know exactly what kinds of permissions you've been given. The great thing about Vimeo is that they also make it easy for you to download your chosen video, in HD, SD and mobile quality. While you're there, you can also check out (and download) everyone's favourite video, &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782" target="_blank"&gt;CC Kiwi&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;Spin Xpress&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://spinxpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Spin Xpress&lt;/a&gt; pulls Creative Commons licensed media from a variety of different websites, including Blip.tv, with simple search filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Internet Archive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for videos in the public domain, &lt;a href="http://archive.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; is the place to go. While most people know about the WayBack Machine, which lets you check out earlier versions of the web, the most interesting part of The Internet Archive is its vast collection of media. Want to check out &lt;a href="http://archive.org/details/DriveInMovieAds" target="_blank"&gt;bizarre drive-in movie ads&lt;/a&gt;? What about &lt;a href="http://blog.archive.org/2010/09/21/little-known-classics-you-need-to-watch/"&gt;old Hollywood movies&lt;/a&gt; that have since passed into the public domain? What about films made by the &lt;a href="http://archive.org/details/FedFlix" target="_blank"&gt;US Government&lt;/a&gt; (including films produced by the CIA, like the '&lt;a href="http://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.614513" target="_blank"&gt;Science of Spying&lt;/a&gt;,' from 1965)? There are over a million such videos, many are which are available to share, remix and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;Films About Creative Commons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons community has put together dozens of short films &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos" target="_blank"&gt;explaining the Creative Commons licences&lt;/a&gt;, some of which are available on the Creative Commons site. While we tend to show off our own &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782" target="_blank"&gt;CC Kiwi&lt;/a&gt;, there are many more Creative Commons videos from around the world, including this '&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1j0OA9N4hs" target="_blank"&gt;Meet Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;' from our friends at Creative Commons Qatar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P-bQB8zUSo]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;Creative Commons Wiki&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons community has put together &lt;a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Films" target="_blank"&gt;this list of films produced under a Creative Commons licence&lt;/a&gt;, including the Academy Award winning documentary &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7402" target="_blank"&gt;A Story of Healing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt; DigitalNZ&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for New Zealand material, your best bet is to check out &lt;a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;DigitalNZ&lt;/a&gt;. Open the search filter and click 'video' and select the usage rights you require.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Culture</category><category>Education</category><category>Tools</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/03/13/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-video.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2013 23:25:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Creative Commons Resources</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/03/08/new-creative-commons-resources.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-3530 alignright" title="Remix Kiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="201"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/"&gt;Mix &amp;amp; Mash&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner, and with our interns looking to show off their skills and knowledge, we decided to rustle up a few new Creative Commons resources. We already had our &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/education/" target="_blank"&gt;education case studies&lt;/a&gt;, our&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank"&gt; brochure&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank"&gt;A3 po&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank"&gt;st&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank"&gt;er&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/the-original-creative-commoners-teachers-and-open-educational-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/understand-and-teach-creative-commons/" target="_blank"&gt;this other post&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/creative-commons-for-new-zealand-schools/" target="_blank"&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt;, originally printed in the Education Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we knew we needed more. So, we first released &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/copyright-creative-commons-mix-mash-lesson-plan/" target="_blank"&gt;our Mix &amp;amp; Mash lesson plan&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly became a popular resource for teachers looking to introduce Creative Commons licensing in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then released a slide show, introducing &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MattMcGregor/creative-commons-for-schools"&gt;Creative Commons licensing for New Zealand schools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after that, we put up &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/A2-finals.2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;our new Creative Commons poster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In November, the New York Times went so far as to give their latest MOOC article the headline, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0" target="_blank"&gt;The Year of the MOOC&lt;/a&gt;. Closer to home, the cover story of &lt;a href="http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/technology/online-learning-the-future-of-education/" target="_blank"&gt;the October 20 New Zeala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/technology/online-learning-the-future-of-education/" target="_blank"&gt;nd Listener (paywall)&lt;/a&gt; discussed the potential ‘shakeup’ of higher education by online courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for that shakeup to occur: Over the summer, New Zealand’s own Open Educational Resources Foundation announced that the University of Southern Queensland would run &lt;a href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" target="_blank"&gt;their own MOOC&lt;/a&gt;--a foundational course in International Relations-- as part of the &lt;a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" target="_blank"&gt;Open Educational Resources University (OERu)&lt;/a&gt;,with academic credit for those who passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/120px-School_of_open_logo.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-3516 alignright" title="120px-School_of_open_logo" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/120px-School_of_open_logo.png" alt="" width="120" height="95"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Soon after, New Zealand’s &lt;a href="http://wikieducator.org/Another_world_first_for_Otago_Polytechnic:_OP_to_offer_full_credential_for_the_OERu" target="_blank"&gt;Otago Polytechnic&lt;/a&gt;, joining the Creative Commons birthday celebrations, announced that their new &lt;a href="http://wikieducator.org/Another_world_first_for_Otago_Polytechnic:_OP_to_offer_full_credential_for_the_OERu" target="_blank"&gt;Graduate Diploma in Tertiary Education&lt;/a&gt; would be offered as a full credential course on the OERu network. As with those offered by University of Southern Queensland, all course materials would be freely available under an open Creative Commons licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, to coincide with &lt;a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Education Week&lt;/a&gt; in March,&lt;a href="https://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-open/" target="_blank"&gt; the School of Open&lt;/a&gt; is offering its first set of courses! &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36913" target="_blank"&gt;As Creative Commons' own Jane Park puts it&lt;/a&gt;, the School runs volunteer courses on “the meaning and impact of ‘openness’ in the digital age and its benefit to creative endeavours, education, research and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first batch of courses includes Australian and US versions of ‘Copyright 4 Educators’ and an introduction to writing Wikipedia articles. Ten more courses—including those on open science, Creative Commons licences and open video—will also be launched after March 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that’s not enough, OER Week events are also taking place across the world!
