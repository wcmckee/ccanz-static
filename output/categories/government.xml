&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know, NZGOAL is a great piece of government policy, which was approved by Cabinet in 2010. In essence, NZGOAL advocates for the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some organisations, like Public Service Departments, are directed to use NZGOAL; state services agencies are strongly encouraged, while school Boards of Trustees are invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years on, we’ve seen a reasonably steady uptake on NZGOAL. Public Service Departments are getting steadily better at using open licensing by default, especially data-heavy agencies like Statistics New Zealand, Land Information New Zealand and Ministry for the Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also seeing uptake in the GLAM sector, with Te Papa, National Library of New Zealand and Auckland Museum all making commitments to open licensing. Schools are also beginning to use CC - we’ve currently got around ninety schools with CC policies, and more to come in the future. Local government and research institutions are also beginning to make moves towards greater openness, which is great to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As NZGOAL gradually became the default setting for the release of an increasing number copyright and non-copyright works, New Zealand Open Government Data Programme decided that the policy and guidance materials it uses needed updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important change was the simplification of the review and release process flow-chart. You can read about the other changes &lt;a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal2/#changelog" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important, though -- from our point of view at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, at least -- is that Creative Commons HQ finished its exhaustive process of developing &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/version4" target="_blank"&gt;the 4.0 version of the CC licences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original version of NZGOAL recommended the use of the Creative Commons 3.0 New Zealand licences. These licences had been ‘ported’ for New Zealand law. If you’re interested in learning more about this, &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/whats-licence/" target="_blank"&gt;check out this interview we conducted with Andrew Matangi&lt;/a&gt;, who led the initial porting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is nothing wrong with the 3.0 NZ licences, the arrival of the 4.0 licences is a welcome opportunity to ensure that everyone in the world is using the same CC licences. The CC licence chooser -- which many people use to get their standard licensing statement -- also puts some hurdles in the way of those people looking for the earlier, ported licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that the NZGOAL team have decided to officially recommend the 4.0 licences. While agencies can still decide to use the older 3.0 NZ licences if they want, the guidance material provided by NZGOAL will recommend the 4.0 licences. Over time, we can expect more and more agencies to go down the CC 4.0 road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you with works licensed under CC 3.0 NZ -- or any other licence -- you don’t need to worry. This licence is still legally valid and robust, and can still be used to licence your work. And if you want to change, that’s fine too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Government</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2015/05/21/nzgoal-version-2.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 23:21:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>LINZ Data Service</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/09/17/linz-data-service.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;By Josh Wright&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In June 2011, Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) launched the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINZ Data Service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (LDS), a web-based tool which allows users to map and download LINZ data. LDS licences most of its data under a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We sat down and had a chat with Manager Jeremy Palmer and Planning and Support Advisor Vicki Lindsay to talk about where the LDS came from, what it’s currently doing, and where it might be headed in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDS was born, Jeremy says, out of the need to do two things: “first, to drive innovation in the private sector to get better reuse of our data, and second, to drive efficiencies within government agencies.” One of the operation’s key requirements, Jeremy says, was the open licensing of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href="http://nzgoal.info/"&gt;New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing&lt;/a&gt; (NZGOAL) framework, deciding to license with Creative Commons was a relatively simple process. “We brought NZGOAL into the equation early on, which allowed us to analyse our methods of licensing—previously, each dataset had its own terms, conditions and restrictions based on various levels of complex copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We concluded pretty quickly that we could relicense most of our datasets under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licences—bar a few which have legal restrictions on them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Topo501.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-4293" title="Topo50" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Topo501-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Screenshot of '&lt;a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/#/layer/767-nz-mainland-topo50-maps/" target="_blank"&gt;NZ Mainland Topo50 Maps&lt;/a&gt;' by LINZ Data Service. Made available under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand Licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicki described the LDS experience as a “bit of a test pilot” for the implementation of the NZGOAL framework. “It was really good for us because we didn’t need to develop any licences, but could adopt a licence recognised both nationally and internationally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LINZ’s Chief Executive at the time, Colin MacDonald, was intimately involved in the cross-government programme for data and information re-use. The adoption of the NZGOAL framework was strategic decision on LINZ’s part - an opportunity for LINZ to show leadership in the open data space.  Jeremy says that stakeholders and partners that contributed to the design of the service would also chip in with advice: “we were  working in partnership with &lt;a href="http://koordinates.com/"&gt;Koordinates&lt;/a&gt;, who provided the technology for LDS and who are heavily involved in the open data movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the launch of the LDS, access to LINZ datasets was primarily done through manual requests and provided on DVDs—a “labour-intensive” and time consuming process. While some of these ‘legacy services’ are running alongside the LDS currently, Vicki notes they will be streamlined into the LDS in the long term. As with any  major change in service delivery, the transition can take time to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jeremy says the change has been for the best: “the service is a professional service, enabling easy online access to our data via a sophisticated set of tools and functionality. In a typical week, LDS gets upwards of 500 file downloads of our datasets—which is much, much more than when our data distribution was manually administered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only has opening the datasets increased usage in numbers, it’s also invited a more diverse user-base, says Vicki. “Because it’s much more accessible now, and free to access, we are seeing our customer base grow to include smaller organisations that may not have used LINZ data before  , whereas customers who used our previous services were generally professional organisations who could consume that complex data quite easily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/LDS-Layer.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4287 " title="LDS Layer" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/LDS-Layer-1024x644.png" alt="" width="485" height="304"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Screenshot of '&lt;a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/#/layer/804-nz-property-titles/" target="_blank"&gt;NZ Property Titles&lt;/a&gt;' by LINZ Data Service. Made available under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand Licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;“It was generally very complex, so it was quite a shift in philosophy for us to go from being a raw bulk data distributor to taking that data and making it accessible to that a wider range of users” adds Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;Landscape architect Nigel Cowburn, of Growplan Ltd., uses the LDS’ datasets in order to arrive at worksites to meet clients “fully armed” with information about the property and landscape as it currently exists.  He says the LDS enables him to prepare ahead of time. “It’s free and reliable, and helps me ask intelligent questions,” Nigel says. “It makes the remote part of my work possible, as I have a good idea of the landscape before I go—the more information I can access online, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;LDS is frequently updated to meet the needs of its customers. But as with any large operation, the project didn’t come without its obstacles. “The release and simplification of large datasets were a big challenge for us to manage—from the outset, however, by partnering with Koordinates, they had already solved some of the issues..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy notes that the service is really showing results. The number of registered users of the LINZ Data Service, currently standing at almost 6.500, continues to climb by an impressive 300 users every month. These customers, spanning government, geospatial, survey, utility, contracting, and engineering sectors and beyond, are using the LINZ Data Service to realise efficiencies, innovation and improved decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LDS’ efforts haven’t gone unrecognised. LINZ was the recipient of the &lt;em&gt;JK Barrie Award for Overall Excellence&lt;/em&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.spatialbusiness.org/aus/Upcoming-Events/Asia-Pacific-Spatial-Excellence-Awards"&gt;Asia Pacific Spatial Excellence Awards&lt;/a&gt;—the premier forum for recognising the spatial information industry’s top performers. Of the award, &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/news-publications-and-consultations/news-and-notices/lds-named-asia-pacific%E2%80%99s-best-of-the-best"&gt;LINZ Chief Executive Peter Mersi&lt;/a&gt; says “it is recognition of the highest order of the value of developing and implementing an easy-to-use geospatial data sharing service.” Mersi says LDS has played a part in “revolutionising the way people can discover, use and share New Zealand public data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy notes that Australians are “envious of the openness of the whole ecosystem” that LDS uses. “In Australia, the multiple levels of government have imposed a model where they’re trying to still do cost recovery for their assets. The fact that we were able to remove barriers with Creative Commons licences really made an impact and helped us win that award. Over there, a lot of their data is still very locked up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quizzed about their advice to other government agencies considering using open licencing, both Jeremy and Vicki are supportive of the measures. “I’d definitely recommend opening access to public, non -private  information across government. If there’s a mandate to adopt open licensing, and you want to get it done, NZGOAL and Creative Commons licences get really good results and can reduce timeframes to actually just get the data out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Data</category><category>Government</category><category>Science</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/09/17/linz-data-service.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2013 23:35:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>More Open Data</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/07/01/more-open-data.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week saw the release of the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programmes/open-and-transparent-government/declaration-open-and-transparent-government/2013-report-adoption-declaration/" target="_blank"&gt;2013 Report on Agency Adoption of the Declaration on Open and Transparent Government&lt;/a&gt;, which directs all Public Service departments (and others) to release their high value public data under a Creative Commons licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report noted that agency uptake of NZGOAL is steadily increasing, with sixty-nine percent of planned data releases to be licensed for legal reuse. Eighty-four percent of departments are including the Declaration in their core business planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Beehive.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4038 " title="Beehive" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Beehive.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="231"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; "Beehive, Wellington, NZ" by Stewart Baird, via &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sxbaird/6256220109/sizes/z/in/photostream/" target="_blank"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. Made available under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution Non Commerical No Derivatives licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good news. The potential effects of the open data programme, as stated in the Declaration itself, go far beyond the open data community. As the Declaration puts it, the point of releasing open data is “to enable the private and community sectors to use it to grow the economy, strengthen our social and cultural fabric, and sustain our environment. We release it to encourage business and community involvement in government decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, more open data is a Good Thing. But where can it be found? The first place to look for open government datasets is the appropriately named &lt;a href="https://data.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;data.govt.nz&lt;/a&gt;. While data.govt.nz doesn’t host any datasets, it links to over 2300 datasets on other government websites; nearly 2000 of these are made available under a Creative Commons licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The datasets give a range of information about New Zealand, including &lt;a href="https://data.govt.nz/dataset/show/3230" target="_blank"&gt;2013 Budget Data&lt;/a&gt; from Treasury to&lt;a href="https://data.govt.nz/dataset/show/3073" target="_blank"&gt; Child and Youth Prosecution Statistics&lt;/a&gt; from the Ministry of Justice. More than half the datasets are provided by Land Information New Zealand, with many more datasets provided by Statistics New Zealand and Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sources of open data and content include &lt;a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;DigitalNZ&lt;/a&gt;, which links to 120 content partners across the country, and the award-winning &lt;a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;LINZ Data Service&lt;/a&gt;, which allows users to 'layer' datasets onto an Open Street Map. We also have the folks at &lt;a href="http://wikinewzealand.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Wiki New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;--we profiled &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/02/wiki-new-zealand/" target="_blank"&gt;WikiNZ here&lt;/a&gt;--who make a range of graphs from open government data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't find what you need, go to data.govt.nz and &lt;a href="https://data.govt.nz/requests/" target="_blank"&gt;make a request&lt;/a&gt;; otherwise, go to &lt;a href="https://fyi.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;FYI.org.nz&lt;/a&gt; to make a request under the Official Information Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make anything with the data you find--or even save time and energy by finding what you need--we'd love &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/contact/" target="_blank"&gt;to hear about it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Data</category><category>Government</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/07/01/more-open-data.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 04:12:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Public Lecture: 'Constructing a Technological Commons'</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/06/13/public-lecture-constructing-a-technological-commons.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this public lecture, &lt;a href="http://www.law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/lee/" target="_blank"&gt;Professor Peter Lee&lt;/a&gt; from UC Davis will discuss ways to enhance access to inventions produced or funded by public institutions, producing what he calls a "technological commons." Hosted by Victoria University of Wellington's Faculty of Law and the Royal Society of New Zealand, the lecture will "challenge the traditional, market-based nature of the patent system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A graduate of Yale Law, Professor Lee has &lt;a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=611323" target="_blank"&gt;published extensively on patent law and intellectual property&lt;/a&gt;, and is a leading voice on the intersection of science and society and the patent system’s impact on scientific and technological progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lecture will be chaired by &lt;a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/about/staff/graeme-austin" target="_blank"&gt;Professor Graeme Austin&lt;/a&gt;, Victoria University Faculty of Law and member of the CCANZ legal team. It will be introduced by &lt;a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/funds/marsden/about/staff/" target="_blank"&gt;Dean Peterson&lt;/a&gt;, Manager of Research Funding at the Royal Society of New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When: Tuesday, 16 July 2013, 5.45pm - 6.55pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response from Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand to NZ On Air’s discussion paper, “NZ On Air: Online Rights and Public Access.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) is the kaitiaki of the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/"&gt;Creative Commons licences in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;. Hosted by the Royal Society of New Zealand, CCANZ supports the roll-out of the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal"&gt;New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework&lt;/a&gt; (NZGOAL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCANZ welcomes NZ On Air’s discussion paper “NZ On Air: Online Rights and Public Access.” We believe that the paper is an excellent starting point for further discussion on how to ensure greater access to New Zealand’s publicly funded culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CCANZ supports the paper’s conclusion that “public funding needs to be better aligned with enabling public access on multiple platforms.” Following the lead of NZGOAL, we believe that opening up New Zealand’s publicly funded copyright works—including those funded by NZ On Air—would have profound cultural and educational benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, most of New Zealand’s publicly funded or publicly housed cultural heritage is unavailable for reuse by New Zealanders. Despite ongoing digitisation projects, these works are neither commercially available nor publicly reusable. This means that creators who want to build on the works of the past—from student filmmakers to non-profit documentary producers—are either forced to reinvent the wheel or go through a difficult process of asking permission, even when the original works are publicly funded and publicly housed and its creators are long deceased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we would like to widen the scope of the discussion to include Creative Commons licensing. Creative Commons licensing would allow New Zealanders to share and reuse publicly funded copyright works, according to a range of licence conditions. Creative Commons licensing would also provide clarity to heritage institutions and would help mitigate the problem of ‘orphan works’—those works that have no obvious rights holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By opening publicly funded copyright works, NZ On Air would be well aligned with the New Zealand Government’s position on open access and open licensing. Approved by Cabinet in July 2010, the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework provides government guidance on the release of works produced by public agencies, specifically advocating the use of Creative Commons licensing for in-copyright works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabinet approved NZGOAL because, as the framework states, “It is widely recognised, in New Zealand and abroad, that significant creative and economic potential may lie dormant in such copyright and non-copyright material when locked up in agencies and not released on terms allowing re-use by others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Cabinet has also approved the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/new-zealand-data-and-information-management-princi" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Data and Information Management Principles&lt;/a&gt;, which are summarised as follows: “government data and information should be open, readily available, well managed, reasonably priced and re-usable unless there are necessary reasons for its protection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognise that this is complex terrain: given the mix of public and private funding involved in the majority of NZ On Air funded works, a blanket model is clearly unworkable. At the same time, it is worth acknowledging the unforeseen consequences of the status quo. Simply put, many contemporary cultural works funded by NZ On Air in 2013 are likely to remain in copyright until at least 2100, restricting the cultural and educational benefits of future dissemination and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better system would ensure that publicly funded copyright works were, after a period of time, made publicly available under an open Creative Commons licence. This would provide a window of time for works to be commercialised, while ensuring that older, no longer commercially viable works were able to be shared and reused by the New Zealand public—effectively giving publicly funded culture a second life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to structure this is to follow the paper’s recommendation of a sliding scale, whereby “the level of public funding from NZ On Air influences arrangements to get funded content made available online.” For works that are entirely funded by NZ On Air, and have no obvious commercial value but great cultural value, Creative Commons licensing could be applied soon after the work’s initial broadcast. This would take advantage on the Internet and digital technologies to more widely disseminate publicly funded culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand supports the efforts of public funding bodies like NZ On Air to open up New Zealand’s publicly funded culture. We also welcome further public discussion on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 10am this morning, &lt;a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Mix &amp;amp; Mash 2013: The New Storytelling&lt;/a&gt; is officially open!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix &amp;amp; Mash wants all New Zealanders, young and old, to tell new stories by adapting and remixing Public Domain and Creative Commons licensed content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous Mixes &amp;amp; Mashes, The New Storytelling will roll out in three phases over the course of the year, with the first round of entries closing on &lt;strong&gt;May 10, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, we're working with just two categories--schools and the general public--with prizes available for all the stories &lt;a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/may-showcase-judges" target="_blank"&gt;our judges select&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All entries selected for showcasing will receive a $50 itunes voucher, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;DigitalNZ&lt;/a&gt;. Selected entries for May will receive larger prizes, provided by Mix &amp;amp; Mash sponsors &lt;a href="http://www.orcon.net.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Orcon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.copyright.co.nz/"&gt;Copyright Licensing New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and our Mix &amp;amp; Mash partner, the Ministry of Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All entries will also be considered for our end-of-year Supreme Awards, provided by &lt;a href="http://www.squiz.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Squiz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;DigitalNZ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School group submissions that help teach New Zealanders about road safety will be considered a special &lt;a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/schools" target="_blank"&gt;NZTA Award for Best Safer Journey’s Story&lt;/a&gt;, receiving up to $500 in vouchers for each team member and $2000 in vouchers for the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/schools" target="_blank"&gt;Mix &amp;amp; Mash portal&lt;/a&gt; has some great remix resources, including our new Creative Commons poster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mash 2013 is organised by &lt;a&gt;DigitialNZ&lt;/a&gt;, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand and the &lt;a&gt;National Library of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and enabled by our amazing 2013 &lt;a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/sponsors-and-partners"&gt;Sponsors and Partners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Culture</category><category>Education</category><category>Government</category><category>Mix and Mash</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/02/05/mix-mash-2013.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2013 20:51:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Towards an Open Archive: UC CEISMIC</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/01/09/uc-ceismic.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3213" title="UCCEISMIC" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/UCCEISMIC.png" alt="" width="485" height="169"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;UC CEISMIC&lt;/a&gt; is a federated archive of materials from the Canterbury earthquakes, hosted by the &lt;a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;University of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in November 2011. With content provided by major New Zealand cultural institutions, like &lt;a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Te Papa&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt; National Library&lt;/a&gt;, as well as ordinary New Zealanders, the archive is an extraordinary—and extraordinarily open—digital resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for the archive began when &lt;a href="http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/engl/people/millar.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;Associate Professor Paul Millar&lt;/a&gt; from the Department of English at the University of Canterbury approached &lt;a href="http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/engl/people/smithies.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;Dr James Smithies&lt;/a&gt;, then working at the Ministry of Health, about what he could do in response to the February earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James pointed Paul to the 9/11 archive, organised by the &lt;a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for History and New Media&lt;/a&gt; at George Mason University. They also considered the &lt;a href="http://hurricanearchive.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Hurricane Memory Bank&lt;/a&gt;, a project designed to collect and preserve stories from hurricanes Rita and Katrina. Paul pitched the idea to the university’s Senior Management team and received a very positive response. He immediately began tireless work to get James down to Christchurch and turn the idea into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these projects in mind, James and Paul considered how they might build something similar for the Canterbury earthquakes. As James put it, the team soon decided that they “would just go out and collect everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/programme-team" target="_blank"&gt;Dr Christopher Thomson&lt;/a&gt;, Programme Office Manager for UC CEISMIC, outlined the steps James and Paul had to take to get the archive online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They put a proposal to the university and got some funding to set something up. From there, they started have conversations with people across the cultural heritage sector, and saw that lots of people were asking the same kinds of questions about an archive for the Canterbury earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They then decided to set up the UC CEISMIC consortium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UC CEISMIC consortium is led by the University of Canterbury and made up of organisations from across the cultural heritage sector, including &lt;a href="http://archives.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Archives New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;National Library of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.mch.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Ministry for Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mch.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt; and Heritage&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.canterburymuseum.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Canterbury Museum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Christchurch City Libraries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/" target="_blank"&gt;NZ OnScreen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.ntrc.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Ngai Tahu Research Centre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cera.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;CERA&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Te Papa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.filmarchive.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Film Archive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christopher puts it, “the idea was that each of the consortium members would collect their own material and archive it according to their own policies, and then use &lt;a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;DigitalNZ&lt;/a&gt; to surface it in one place, so that users could search for earthquake-related content at ceismic.org.nz.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does Creative Commons come in? Given the ambitions of the project, in these early stages “Creative Commons wasn’t in the mix.” Later, though, James began to introduce the idea of open licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ROSS2478-1D3_pt.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-3203" title="ROSS2478-1D3_pt" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ROSS2478-1D3_pt.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="297"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/search/23370333"&gt;Christchurch Cathedral in Cathedral Square&lt;/a&gt; by Ross Becker, via &lt;a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/"&gt;CEISMIC&lt;/a&gt;. This image is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/."&gt;Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commerical No Derivatives 3.0 New Zealand licence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;James had been a Creative Commons supporter for years, had strong support from Paul to investigate CC licenses, and was offered excellent advice from Jason Darwin at CWA New Media (later &lt;a href="http://www.learningmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Learning Media Limited&lt;/a&gt;). He understood the problems ‘All Rights Reserved’ copyright can pose for heritage projects, though, and soon found there were issues having multiple licensing agreements across different sections of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was handed to Christopher Thomson when he arrived in the team. However, little progress could be made, despite his best efforts and those of a range of stakeholders. The problem was worst with research–oriented data, which had specific issues related to ethics and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[quote float="right"]We don’t really know how people are going to use our content... We want to leave that open as far as possible, for the future.[/quote]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, when approaching potential depositors, the UC CEISMIC team recommended the use of Creative Commons licences, though remained open to more restrictive licensing agreements, according to the specific needs of content providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archive launched in November 2011, with ten thousand items, and continues to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Canterbury’s specific contribution to the consortium is called &lt;a href="https://quakestudies.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;UC QuakeStudies&lt;/a&gt;, and includes materials from &lt;a href="http://www.fairfaxmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Fairfax Media&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.crc.govt.nz/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Environment Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.historic.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Historic Places Trust&lt;/a&gt;. While much of this content remains All Rights Reserved, the archive has recently added a collection by Murray Quartly, who runs &lt;a href="http://www.focus360.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;focus360.co.nz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the earthquakes, Murray took a series of 360 degree panorama photographs of central Christchurch, producing what Christopher describes as a “virtual tour of the Red Zone.” After meeting with the UC CEISMIC team, Quartly decided to release the photos under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several more collections are ready to go live, and dozens more planned. Creative Commons will be used as much as possible, and it is hoped that a full review can be undertaken in years to come that assess opportunities to migrate targeted collections to CC licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another significant part of the consortium is QuakeStories, which is run by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. This archive contains stories and photos from the earthquake from ordinary New Zealanders, and is licensed under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share-Alike licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Christopher and James suggest that the biggest hurdles to using Creative Commons licences have come from researchers—especially those working through the University’s ethics committee, which is already a complex process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UC CEISMIC team continue to encourage their partners to use open licensing, wherever possible, and Creative Commons licences remain a core part of the UC CEISMIC programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Christopher points out, “We don’t really know how people are going to use our content. It makes sense to make it open wherever possible, because we don’t know what research questions and methods will be like in 100 years’ time. We want to leave that open as far as possible, for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Culture</category><category>Government</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/01/09/uc-ceismic.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jan 2013 22:13:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Open Access to Scholarly Publishing</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2012/10/22/open-access-to-scholarly-publishing.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Penny Carnaby&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What's happening in scholarly publishing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;There has been considerable discussion of scholarly publishing in the media recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the Research Works Act and the Federal Research Public Access Act cthat generated a storm of protest across the world, including a boycott of Elsevier journals. This debate was significant in succeeding to get the issues about Open Access Publishing debated on the international stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Great Britain, the &lt;a href="http://www.researchinfonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Finch-Group-report-FINAL-VERSION.pdf"&gt;Finch Report&lt;/a&gt; expanded and deepened the debate on Open Access Publishing significantly. The report met with mixed reviews from Open Access proponents and the publishing industry. The greatest benefit of the report is that it brought the debate about ‘Green’ and ‘Gold’ Open Access to a much broader international audience. The likely funding and policy implications for research agencies was laid out clearly in this report but is, at this stage, unresolved.&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/openaccess.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright" title="openaccess" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/openaccess.jpg" alt="" width="221" height="221"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has changed its policy position requiring NHMRC supported research to be deposited in &lt;a href="http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/media/notices/2012/revised-policy-dissemination-research-findings"&gt;Open Access Research Repositories&lt;/a&gt;. This initiative has prompted widespread discussion about Open Access Publishing in the Australian context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more examples: International events have brought the issues of Open Access Publishing into the spotlight and it is highly likely that the momentum towards Open Access Publishing will increase. There are clear signals of significant shifts in scholarly publishing conventions in New Zealand in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What problems are we trying to address?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the conversation about scholarly publishing is trying to address several issues including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="I"&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;better, faster, more affordable access to publicly funded research publications for everyone&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;greater public access to research funded by the public purse&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the increasing disquiet that the process of scholarly communication has not really yet leveraged the potential, reach and scale of the internet&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the unacceptable and unaffordable escalating cost of research publishing and scholarly output, particularly relating to the larger science based aggregates and publishers&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;understanding how we assess research impact, peer review processes and the integrity of the research process in an Open Access environment.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is open access?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While journals are now online, they are only available to people who pay a subscription or who are members of an institution who pays a subscription. Put simply open access uses digital technology to make research findings widely available. Researchers can make their work open access by one of two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing in an open access journal such as &lt;em&gt;PLoS One&lt;/em&gt; is referred to as ‘gold’ open access. This may incur an article processing fee. While a few universities in Australia provide funds for open access publishing, the majority do not. Researchers may wish to consider including these fees in any grant proposals. Note that the 2012 ARC Discovery Grant funding rules allow 2% of the grant to be used for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively researchers can deposit a version of their work into a subject based repository such as arXiv.org, SSRN or RePEc, or an institutional repository. Every university in Australia and New Zealand has a repository for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doesn’t open access contravene copyright?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally the copyright of a paper is held by the author or the author’s institution prior to publication. The publisher’s agreement the author signs at the time of publication usually transfers the copyright of the work to the publisher. This then restricts use of the published work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While putting the published version of a work into a repository (or onto Mendeley or Academia.edu) will contravene most publishers’ agreements, the majority of publishers allow an earlier version of a paper to be deposited into a repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version most researchers make available is the accepted version – the final peer reviewed and corrected paper. This is sometimes called a post print. The Sherpa/RoMEO website (&lt;a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/"&gt;http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/&lt;/a&gt;) lists the policies for most publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang="en-NZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the alternatives to copyright?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons (&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/"&gt;http://creativecommons.org.au/&lt;/a&gt;) is a set of internationally accepted licences which helps an organisation, author (or content) to share their work and indicate how they wish their work to be used. In New Zealand the government has adopted Creative Commons (see NZGOAL &lt;a href="http://nzgoal.info/"&gt;http://nzgoal.info/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively there is an option for authors to amend their publisher’s agreement with an author addenda. There are online tools to generate these automatically (&lt;a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/addendum.shtml"&gt;http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/addendum.shtml&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the benefits of OA?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of research is to increase global knowledge. Disseminating work through open access channels means that researchers in less resourced institutions, practitioners in the field and the general public can share findings. The taxpayer supports the research, the writing up of results, and the peer review and editing process. Open access allows these taxpayers to see these findings without having to pay to view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are some of the concerns with OA?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers express concern about plagiarism, particularly in terms of making theses available. However, while plagiarism occurs all the time, making work available in a repository clearly identifies the author as the owner of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishers clearly have concerns that making work open access could affect subscriptions to their journals and threaten their viability. However, to date there is scant evidence that this will happen. The physics community has been making their work available through arXiv.org for over 20 years and this has not caused physics journals to fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can universities support open access?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities can support the sharing of their researchers by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Ensuring the university has a robust open access policy&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Considering an open access mandate&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Educating researchers on the benefits of open access&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Raising awareness of scholarly communication issues amongst the academic and library staff&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Encouraging authors to use Creative Commons licenses or author addenda&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What does this mean in the New Zealand context?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage in New Zealand we are not seeing the magnitude of change that is being observed in Europe, USA and Australia. Having said this, there are strong Central Government signals about Open Access in relation to government data and information that may well transfer to research funding generally before long.&lt;/p&gt;

By June 2012, 75% of all government departments had already released their data, and the majority had plans to do so in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, as the open government folks like to say, you're only as good as your last reuse.  This is why Creative Commons licences are so important: they allow members of the public to share, remix and reuse public data, without having to ask permission in advance. Going by download figures from platforms like&lt;a title="Koordinates: the one place for geodata" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/10/koordinates-the-one-place-for-geodata/" target="_blank"&gt; Koordinates&lt;/a&gt;, more people are viewing and downloading publicly funded data. But what about reuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few great examples coming to light. Last week, the government's ICT hub published two new case studies. The first, &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/open-data-case-studies/anz-truckometer-case-study" target="_blank"&gt;on the ANZ truckometer&lt;/a&gt;, has&lt;a href="http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/truckometer-buoyed-strong-dairy-activity-ca-121000" target="_blank"&gt; received&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/7652708/Agriculture-drives-weak-economy" target="_blank"&gt;a lot of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/7476113/Truckometer-suggests-weak-economy" target="_blank"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/115752/indicator-suggests-economy-will-continue-to-muddle-along" target="_blank"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; since its release in April. Using traffic volume data released by NZTA,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;"ANZ selected key routes and applied statistical techniques to smooth out anomalies and gaps. The result is a strong correlation between traffic flows and predicting economic growth or decline as measured by GDPdata from Statistics New Zealand. ANZ has found that, in general, light traffic flows give a 6 month heads-up on the direction the economy will take and heavy traffic flows give an even more accurate picture 6 months later."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second case study &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/open-data-case-studies/charities-register" target="_blank"&gt;looked at the Charities Register&lt;/a&gt;, a tool released by the Charities Commission in June 2011. The Register offers information from over 25, 000 registered charities for reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. Since this initial release, the Register has been used by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;funding bodies like The Southern Trust;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;government bodies like the Ministry for Social Development and the Families Commission;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;media organisations;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;students and researchers;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;local government bodies, like the Manawatu District Council; and,&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;volunteer portals, such as that under construction by Student Job Search.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are, of course, just a couple of examples of how government data is being released and reused--there are many, many more. Some of these are up at &lt;a href="http://opendatastories.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Data Stories&lt;/a&gt;. Creative Commons and the good people in the New Zealand Open Government Data and Information Programme will continue to release more case studies in the weeks ahead. Look out for these, &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/case-studies/" target="_blank"&gt;check out some of our older case studies&lt;/a&gt;, and get in touch if you've been reusing openly licensed government data. We're always keen to hear what you've doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Government</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2012/10/03/who-is-using-open-government-data.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2012 02:12:42 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
