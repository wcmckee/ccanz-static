&lt;p&gt;On the morning of 25 March, I found myself helping Fabiana Kubke and Cameron McLean run a workshop for a hodge-podge of enthusiastic librarians, researchers and infrastructure providers in a conference room in Queenstown, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop was held in Queenstown as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.eresearch.org.nz/content/eresearch-nz-2015" target="_blank"&gt;eResearch NZ 2015 conference&lt;/a&gt;, organised by the National e-Science Infrastructure (NeSI), Research and Education Advanced Network New Zealand (REANNZ) and New Zealand Genomics Limited (NZGL). The conference brought together researchers and infrastructure providers to, as the name of the conference suggests, discuss the future of eResearch in Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were there to tease out how we might develop open educational resources on Reproducible, Open and Collaborative Science research (i.e. research that ROCS - thanks to Peter Murray-Rust for the splendid acronym-ing. And yes, the allusion to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_%28mythology%29" target="_blank"&gt;the mythical Roc&lt;/a&gt; is entirely intentional.). These open resources will be incorporated into a cross-disciplinary 700-level (i.e. postgraduate) course at the University of Auckland, though we are hopeful that the resources could be used for a range of different purposes across the New Zealand tertiary education sector and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had come well prepared. Fabiana and Cameron had held a similar workshop in Auckland in September last year, and had a heap of data from those sessions regarding which skills and tools researchers valued. While at Mozfest in 2014, Fabiana had also worked with the wonderful Kaitlin Thainey (from Mozilla Science Lab) and the equally wonderful Billy Meinke (then at CC International) to help develop a flexible and modular structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to cover. Open research, broadly defined, refers to a research process that effectively ‘bakes in’ openness from the beginning. This ensures that other researchers -- as well as people who aren’t researchers or experts in any given field -- can follow the research process, which makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues and to reproduce the research in other contexts (&lt;a href="http://www.jove.com/blog/2012/05/03/studies-show-only-10-of-published-science-articles-are-reproducible-what-is-happening" target="_blank"&gt;which is not always easy&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason to make research more open is to give access to a range of groups currently almost entirely excluded from research. These include policy makers, advocates, citizen scientists, journalists, teachers and students outside of large research institutions -- as well as the general public, who have often paid for the research in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big issue, and copyright and open licensing is only one aspect. As the picture above suggests, there are heaps of skills needed to practise open research; moreover, many of these skills are generally &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; taught in the existing science education system. How, then, do we teach open research skills, to make open research standard practice across the research sector?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the difficulties is that most established researchers don’t know quite what ‘open research’ looks like, and generally lack the basic knowledge, skills and tools required make their research truly open. This is a problem, because established researchers -- like established teachers, librarians, government officials and Public Leads of Creative Commons -- pass on the norms of research practice on to their students, and thus reproduce the system as they know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution devised by Fabiana and team is to start from the middle: i.e, with postgraduate and early-career researchers. Rather than take on the twin challenge of immediately scaling a course to several thousand undergraduates and attempting to change the practices of late-career researchers, the aim is to train the next generation of researchers and lecturers in the ethos and practices of open research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what did we cover? Rather than lecture at a room of experts, we decided to mine them for their expertise. Employing a delicate mix of table arrangements, peer pressure and sugary incentives, we had the attendees arrange themselves into five groups, and from there Cameron gave them a series of activities so they could share the skills and tools necessary to conduct open research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response was fantastic - so fantastic that I could barely keep up. One of the initial questions - what is missing from our existing modules? - received at least 18 responses, and it seemed like the following question - which skills are most important? - could have had a 75-minute workshop all of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop ended with a discussion on some of the practicalities of teaching open science, a discussion that sadly had to be cut short at the end of our allotted 75 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the session, Cameron, Fabiana and I met to debrief, and agreed that the skills the open resources would need to address - such as research communication, data management, collaboration, versioning and visualisation - were notably &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; specific to computer scientists, and, more notably, not even limited to scientists. While there were some technical and domain-specific suggestions (one of my notes reads “optimising in a parallel universe”: how great does that sound?), the groups soon began to focus on skills and capabilities that would be useful to researchers across every discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practising what we preach, Cameron has shared &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubke/MozFest2014-OS-Skills-Curriculum/wiki/eResearchNZ-2015-Workshop" target="_blank"&gt;all our existing data and resources on Github&lt;/a&gt;. My rough notes from the session are &lt;a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/6iKGo4Qi1E" target="_blank"&gt;on an etherpad here&lt;/a&gt;, and will be expanded as we bring the notes from participants together. We (and by we I mean Cameron) also has a pile of written notes from the participants that we’re going to gather together and publish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Data</category><category>Matt McGregor</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/teaching-reproducible-open-collaborative-science.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 08:05:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Busy Year for the Commons in Aotearoa</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/busy-year-commons-aotearoa.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is re-posted from &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog" target="_blank"&gt;the Creative Commons International blog&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for Asia Pacific Regional Coordinator Jessica Coates for the editorial assistance!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the first of a series of blog posts focusing on our global activities, Matt McGregor tells us of exciting developments in CC in New Zealand Aotearoa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 has been a busy year for the commons in Aotearoa. After a few years of relatively slow progress, many of New Zealand’s public institutions have started to adopt open policies. So many, in fact, that we’ve decided to launch an entire website, &lt;a href="http://http://nzcommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;NZCommons.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to discussing the opportunities and challenges of opening New Zealand’s culture and knowledge for access and reuse. With a particular focus on copyright, licensing and the public domain, the NZCommons site aims to help cross-pollinate and energise the various open groups in New Zealand, who are all doing excellent work, though too often in isolation from one another. The site will have news, case studies and a range of pieces from New Zealanders working to grow the commons, supporting and encouraging the many individuals and institutions working to adopt CC licensing across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what a lot there is to be discussed. I’ve already mentioned some of the developments being highlighted on NZCommons in my &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/43758"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; to this blog about Creative Commons policies being passed in New Zealand schools, now up to the rate of around one per week. But the increased adoption of CC licensing hasn’t been limited to schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, both the &lt;a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz" target="_blank"&gt;University of Waikato&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz" target="_blank"&gt;University of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; passed open access mandates requiring all research published within their respective institutions to be uploaded to the library’s repository, enabling research to be made openly available as soon as possible. In so doing, they joined &lt;a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Lincoln University&lt;/a&gt; in paving the way for open access policies at other New Zealand research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, in the middle of the year, we saw three big developments in the heritage sector. First, the &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz" target="_blank"&gt;National Library of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; passed their excellent &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/blog/posts/our-new-use-and-reuse-policy"&gt;use and reuse policy&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a clear framework for opening up the library’s collections. Under the policy, out-of-copyright works will be clearly labelled as such, which has not generally been the case in the sector; also, in-copyright works that are owned by the library will be made available under a Creative Commons licence. Our &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/11/national-librarys-new-use-reuse-policy/" target="_blank"&gt;case study of this policy has been up on NZCommons for a few weeks now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Te Papa&lt;/a&gt;, the Museum of New Zealand followed this announcement by &lt;a href="http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2014/06/03/free-downloadable-images-from-te-papas-collections/" target="_blank"&gt;releasing over 30,000 high resolution images&lt;/a&gt; under either a no-known copyright or a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives licence&lt;/a&gt; — a figure that has since approached 40,000. As it happens, we published a &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/te-papas-openly-licensed-images/" target="_blank"&gt;case study about Te Papa&lt;/a&gt; recently, as well. Since that release, Te Papa have signalled that they will shortly remove the ‘ND’ restriction from their licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;WW100&lt;/a&gt; team, announced that as part of New Zealand’s commemorations of the Centenary of World War I, the &lt;a href="https://natlib.govt.nz/collections/a-z/alexander-turnbull-library-collections" target="_blank"&gt;Turnbull Library&lt;/a&gt; was openly releasing the H Series of photographs taken during by New Zealand’s official photographer, Henry Armytage Sanders. As Melanie Lovell-Smith points out in a &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/photographing-new-zealanders-at-war" target="_blank"&gt;detailed background piece&lt;/a&gt;, these photographs are “the most comprehensive visual record of New Zealanders on the Western front from 1917 to 1918.” Other GLAM projects, such as the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/11/marsden-online-archive/" target="_blank"&gt;Marsden Online project&lt;/a&gt;, are also starting to use CC licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting things about these announcements is the best practice implementation by each of the institutions. Although all of them use their own method, all of the photos are clearly marked as being available to download and free of copyright restrictions, with a detailed and easily accessible description of what you can and can’t do with the image (see pictured). Te Papa even allows you to use copyright status as a search term. This level of transparency when it comes to copyright is essential to unlocking the value of our national collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Object/41504/download"&gt;&lt;img src="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/collections.tepapa.govt_.nz_Object_41504_download.jpg" alt="Wellington" width="500" height="333" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Object/41504/download"&gt;Excerpt from Te Papa’s image download page&lt;/a&gt; / Te Papa Tongarewa&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other open projects — such open government data, open textbooks in higher education and legal tools for indigenous knowledge — are also progressing quickly. Working with Susy Frankel and Aroha Mead from &lt;a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz" target="_blank"&gt;Victoria University of Wellington&lt;/a&gt; and CC Panel Member Karaitiana Taiuru, the local Creative Commons team is working on developing an indigenous knowledge notice that will help Māori creators, iwi (tribe) and hapū (sub-tribe) to release their works more openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the government data sector, &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz" target="_blank"&gt;Land Information New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have released truly massive — and massively interesting — open datasets, including detailed aerial photography of the entire country and &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/news/2014-03/3d-models-released-christchurch-city" target="_blank"&gt;3D models of Christchurch before September 2010&lt;/a&gt;. These openly licensed models can be adapted and 3D printed by anyone, to help remember the heritage that was lost in the earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these projects will add an enormous amount of high quality copyright works to the commons, making it easier to access and reuse the works produced and held by New Zealand’s public institutions. These releases promise to save time and money for both the organisations involved and the public. They will also enable others to adapt and build on existing works, which means that fewer people will have to — excuse the cliche — reinvent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news, then. But these projects are only the beginning: there are thousands of other schools, heritage and research institutions with millions of copyright works that could be made openly available to the public for sharing and reuse. This could fundamentally change how New Zealanders access and engage with their culture and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to happen, these sectors are going to need some help. To help out, we’re developing toolkits — remixing some resources and platforms developed by HQ, and making a bunch of our own — that organisations can use to open their works for reuse. These toolkits will include an introductory paper, brochures, articles, sample policies and examples of best practice from New Zealand and around the world. We’re hoping to launch them at the National Digital Forum in Wellington in late November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the toolkits, though, we’re going to need much more open discussion and analysis on copyright, licensing and reuse — especially in the heritage sector, where copyright issues can be very complicated, and where there isn’t nearly enough information and discussion available online. NZCommons is designed to prompt that discussion. With it we hope to build momentum and support for more open policy across the country, and help realise the potential of the commons in Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Data</category><category>Education</category><category>Heritage</category><category>Matt McGregor</category><category>Research</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/busy-year-commons-aotearoa.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2014 08:58:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>On the Open Government Partnership</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/ogp.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY NATHAN PARKER&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SummitLogo1.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-402" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/SummitLogo1-1024x328.png" alt="SummitLogo1" width="605" height="194"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Image by Open Government Partnership. CC-BY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a teacher interested in open education I became quietly optimistic over&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/%20%20http://www.ssc.govt.nz/open-government-partnership" target="_blank"&gt; the New Zealand government's acceptance&lt;/a&gt; of an invitation to join the &lt;a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Government Partnership&lt;/a&gt;. The OGP is a forum of countries working to ensure that member governments are more open, accountable and responsive to its citizens. As part of their membership, the government is required to demonstrate how it will implement transparency, accountability, technology and innovation and civil society participation in government. They are also required to prepare an Action Plan of commitments aimed at working towards these OGP objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the OGP &lt;a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/united-kingdom/commitment/social-investment" target="_blank"&gt;the UK Prime Minister David Cameron promoted open government&lt;/a&gt;, pledging to make the UK government the most open and transparent in the world and describing open data as the new raw material of the 21st century, holding governments to account, driving choice and improving public services. He also said it inspires innovation and enterprise that spurs social and economic growth. The UK government even committed that by 2015, it will be the most transparent social investment market in the Open Government Partnership and in line with the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/207772/Open_Data_Charter.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Open Data Charter&lt;/a&gt; principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open Data Charter (ODC) recognizes the central role open data can play in improving government and governance and in stimulating growth through innovation in data-driven products and services. Open data is freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control. ODC states that data should be Open by Default. The UK government's response has seen it planning to move &lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/%20http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/29/uk-government-plans-switch-to-open-source-from-microsoft-office-suite" target="_blank"&gt;to using open source software and to standardise on open formats&lt;/a&gt;. The policy would break the oligopoly of software suppliers and save the UK ongoing software licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the OGP it is a requirement for governments to engage in open consultation with stakeholders, seeking input on mandated standards for software interoperability, data and document formats. Standards also for creating, viewing, sharing and using documents and that all government departments must comply with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OGP forum would allow the New Zealand government a legitimate reason to break away from its present procurement practices that have led to proprietary lock-in, limited interoperability, and excessive costs. This has the potential to make government ICT more open, cheaper and better connected and would have avoided the Novopay débâcle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would require government documentation and resources be in file formats and licensing that makes them accessible to all, shareable and reusable. Policies would still recognise national and international legislation pertaining to intellectual property, personally-identifiable and sensitive information. Everything else would be open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand government's own ICT strategy action plan has similar guiding principles of sharing by default, openness and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My optimism increased to enthusiasm when I thought the New Zealand government might follow a model similar to the UK. It has the potential for saving the government millions of dollars every year but more importantly - access to data, as images, publications and research (our nation's data heritage opened!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I envisaged the Ministry of Education mandated by government policy, transitioning from closed proprietary software to open source software equivalents that could be improved and adapted for NZ. Learning institutions and students accessing the same software, regardless of family income or willingness to become pirates! All student work would be stored in formats that they owned rather than that of a software provider - digital portfolios managed to allow student content to be accessible into the future and without having to buy software to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is such huge potential with opened data, but I really got excited at an idea to use the dust gathering 1980's BSM programme (Bloody Silly Maths). This stunning Kiwiana and Pacifica influenced resource could be remixed under creative commons licenses - Kiwi ingenuity unleashed and backed by independent research fully funded by the MOE (presently a user-pays system for government research information). We could have a future proofed, digitally dusted programme of BSM (Bloody Sonic Maths).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then began to dream of other iconic resources being opened up; students and teachers allowed to legally re-use images of Dame Whina on her 1975 land march hikoi or school journal articles on Sir Edmund, driving a Hamilton jet boat up the Ganges - all available for remixing for a modern audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my excitement about New Zealand joining the OGP, I made an OIA request for a copy of the government's OGP draft action plan. I also asked for a list of submitters and stakeholders to the plan and the selection criteria for these stakeholders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reply was a refusal from a closed government who used their right to withhold information!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as an open educator, dropped is my dream of accountability and openness, gone is choice and improvements in public services; and as for inspiring innovation and enterprise that spurs social and economic growth – I would suggest moving to Waitati!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is a compilation of reflections I've had participating in a number of hack days and similar events over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience of these types events has been fostered over a number of years tinkering with and helping out with open source communities. In particular, I have fond memories helping out as a volunteer tester and developer with the &lt;a href="http://one.laptop.org/" target="_blank"&gt;One Laptop Per Child&lt;/a&gt; programme, and its subsequent software offshoot Sugar Labs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the terms unconference and hackday imply informality, mutual respect, community development and shared values. Throw a little bit of frugality in there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/504706683_53df830eef_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-318 size-full" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/504706683_53df830eef_z.jpg" alt='Reference: "Unconference Schedule" by Jill.

&lt;h5&gt;Tips for Everybody&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Know your goals&lt;/em&gt;. If you are planning on putting on an event, take the time to think about who you are trying to bring together and why. A hackfest is going to bring technical folk. Talk to technical folk about the kinds of things that will be handy, useful and attractive at the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Talk to people&lt;/em&gt;. There are a number of people within New Zealand. One of the best agencies at this is the National Library of New Zealand. The culture and heritage sector's &lt;a href="http://www.ndf.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;National Digital Forum&lt;/a&gt; and its unconference segment are world-class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invite media&lt;/em&gt; - as well as unconventional media - to get involved. Many teams would love to have their work profiled. But don’t talk to project teams for too long. Geeks need flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use social media tactfully&lt;/em&gt;. You will get better engagement from technical communities by investing in well-written blogs post than tweets. A small number of people will tweet your event heavily anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Break out space&lt;/em&gt;. Have a few quiet meeting spaces available to be booked in fifteen minute increments. That will provide an outlet to people who are pretty chatty while balancing the need for quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;HackAKL&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hackakl.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;HackAKL&lt;/a&gt;, which took place on 24-25 May and positioned itself as 'Auckland's first civic hacking event', was well run, well catered, well financed and well publicised. It was also one of the most disappointing events I've been involved with. The focus on competition and the lavish spending really began to upset me by the second day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the free coffee and scoffed my way through plenty of free food, but I kept thinking of the extra bus or two that could have been paid for by forgoing the consultant and marketing fees that would have gone into the event to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counter-argument to my position is likely to run something like, “It was a key event, it needed to be managed professionally”. HackAKL became the centrepiece of a new technology roll-out that included a brand-new API. Hundreds of people signed up to participate. And the stakes were high. And that is why I think that it might have been more sensible for the council to have run multiple small events, rather than one big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology roll-out did not run smoothly. The new API did not get released on time. The dummy data provided was inconsistent with the documentation. A number of good ideas could not get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HackAKL included several invited speakers - including international keynotes via video conference - who were ignored by almost all of the delegates. This made me think that there was too much pushed into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that went relatively well though was the creation of stories and teams beforehand in the wiki. However, as many of the teams were participating as part of corporate groups, there wasn’t a large degree of information-sharing between groups before hand (at least from my limited vantage point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6108763356_37c97a1c62_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-319" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6108763356_37c97a1c62_z.jpg" alt="Reference: 'Auckland from the Sky Tower' by Antonio Colosimo.

&lt;p&gt;Connecting people could have been a much stronger aim for the event. There are a few examples where facilitating network building could have been improved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The mailing list was not approachable. I subscribed early and a person’s name never appeared in any of the emails. The event organisers were intentionally being anonymous.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;If a council or government department is running an open data event; they should include members of the local open data community. New Zealand has an active group of public servants, hackers and industry members already - but that group didn’t receive official notification of the event.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The competition element really killed cooperation and communication between teams during the event&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I wonder if a smaller event - or perhaps a series of much smaller events - would have felt more Kiwi. As the weekend progressed, I kept thinking of the massive posters, gorgeous website and thinking 'this spend isn't doing much for the people of Mangere who just want a cheaper bus fare'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, one of the Mozilla Foundation’s newest initiatives, the Science Lab, &lt;a href="http://mozillascience.org/the-mozsprint-heard-round-the-world/" target="_blank"&gt;held its first global sprint&lt;/a&gt;. The sprint involved two working days of activity in about 30 sites worldwide. Cities were hooked together via video conference. Project leaders handed projects over between cities. As you slept, people kept extending the work that you began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for this event was tiny. Venues were donated. Marketing material was produced on free and open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand, space was donated by two New Zealand companies - Catalyst IT in Auckland, and Dragonfly Data Science in Wellington. My time (which I used to help organise the Auckland site) was donated to the cause by my employer, the &lt;a href="https://www.nesi.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand eScience Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the scale was similar to HackAKL, several hundred participants over two days, participating in the sprint felt much more intimate and welcoming. At HackAKL, every team felt very isolated. Within the sprint, teams could work independently but they could also share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital collaboration tools were extremely beneficial. Both video conferencing and IRC played vital and complementary roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I joined the video conference, I was warmly welcomed by Alison Stringer in Wellington, Damien Irving in Melbourne and Kaitlin Thaney in New York. We were a small team in Auckland, but felt very much invited to participate in the worldwide project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;ThatCAMP&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to home, the digital humanities community hold a lovely event annually called &lt;a href="http://wellington2013.thatcamp.org/about/" target="_blank"&gt;THATcamp.&lt;/a&gt; THATcamp - The Humanities And Technology camp - is where humanities students and scholars come together to explore how tech can assist them in their practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital humanists use computational tools such as natural language processing to conduct (meta)analyses of corpora. (Excuse the jargon!) These days, humanities scholars use computers to read lots of things and try to detect patterns that are impossible for humans to detect by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For THATcamp, there is no large pool of public funding for the event. There are a no large banners. Instead, there might be a website administered by someone in their spare time, a mailing list and a passion for collaboration. During the day-long event, people pick the schedule that they are interested in. And they talk. And they learn. And they might build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcomes could be new partnerships, an understanding of issues faced by other projects, strengthening of relationships and building mutual respect with players such as a university’s IT support staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I've noticed is that there has been a strong tend towards corporatisation of the ‘unconference’. It’s cool to ‘hack’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There once were unconferences, now there are hackday startups. Code for America is being spun out around the globe and I feel that Auckland suffered because of the insistence to follow a cookie cutter format. I understand the motivations - a Chief Executive is far more likely to want to sign off on an event that has a defined structure and is well-rehearsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, building a competition drives teams away from each other and doesn’t enable two other key goals -  creative exploration and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;This is a piece from a member the Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ community., and is licensed CC-BY-SA. If you want to write for us, please email matt@creativecommons.org.nz.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Land Information New Zealand officials, prompted by the support in NZGOAL for free culture CC licenses, started liberating the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/09/linz-data-service/" target="_blank"&gt;publicly-funded map data they hold&lt;/a&gt; under CC-BY, they may have anticipated that their data could end up in OpenStreetMap.org (OSM). OSM is the libre licensed, crowdsourced, world mapping project (formerly CC-BY-SA, now Open DataBase License) created as a free-as-in-speech alternative to Google Maps, which licenses copyright map and image data from other companies. What they probably never imagined was their data appearing on community sites like the new NSW government funded &lt;a href="http://www.timebanking.com.au/" target="_blank"&gt;TimeBanking platform&lt;/a&gt; and in maps powered by Leafet, the free code, mobile-friendly, web map engine which uses OSM as the default source for map data. Such are the unintended benefits that flow from sharing in the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-6030" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg" alt="X" width="546" height="366"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Screenshot of &lt;a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/1910-otago-075m-rural-aerial-photos-2004-2011/" target="_blank"&gt;Otago 0.75m aerial photography&lt;/a&gt; by LINZ. Made available under a Creative Commons Attribution licence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as OSM contributed to the development of websites using Leaflet, the cultural commons also has a contribution to make to the development of free code speech recognition software. Douglas Bagnall gave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BGLrLXm3c" target="_blank"&gt;a great talk&lt;/a&gt; about free code speech recognition engines at Kiwi PyCon 2012, and one of the main non-coding challenges he identified is the lack of a suitably large corpus of spoken speech with which to train' the software (the interesting bits for non-coders starts at about 3:00), particularly for less common accents like New Zealand English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas mentioned a site called VoxForge.org and encouraged us all to record some speech for it. VoxForge collects samples of speech to "compile them into acoustic models for use with Open Source speech recognition engines", with both the acoustic models and the source data are made available under the GNU General Public License, the free code software license used by the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voxforge is a great resource, but it would be a lot of work to drive enough 'Nu Zylnd' accented speakers there. and it occurred to me recently that there is another source of spoken speech for which there is strong argument for libre licensing; public interest radio. Releasing audio programs made for National Radio, student radio, and community access radio, under a libre license (eg CC-BY), has always seemed like a no-brainer to me. Even before I set up &lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/2014/05/07/cc-nz@groups.creativecommons.org.nz" target="_blank"&gt;the CC-NZ email list&lt;/a&gt;, I was contacting community radio people and telling them about the potential benefits of podcasting and CC licensing for increasing program exposure, as part of my work with Aotearoa.Indymedia.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Radio are publicly-owned and funded, and currently podcast all their programs in both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats. Student radio stations have also been experimenting with recording their shows and turning them into podcasts, and if they libre licensed the sometimes substantial spoken word parts of recordings like &lt;a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/radio1/" target="_blank"&gt;the Radio1 shows shared on MixCloud&lt;/a&gt;, they'd be unlikely to miss out on any commercial return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community access radio stations, as their name suggests, exist to give special interest groups in our communities access to the airwaves, so their unique voices have a chance to be heard in broadcast media. Access stations are heavily subsidised by public broadcasting funding, and their programs aren't expected to have commercial potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever these programs are rebroadcast, both the program producers, and the public who subsidize their production, get more bang for their buck. Over the last decade or so, access radio stations have been building up the infrastructure to digitally record programs, so they can be made available as podcasts, on sites like accessradio.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I notice in all three cases though, is that despite NZGOAL-inspired wave of CC license adoptions across public service organisations from LINZ, to schools and tertiary institutions, to archives and museums, I see no sign of CC licenses on locally made radio so far. I'm guessing one issue is legal confusion and risk aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if I want to CC my radio program, what about the copyright songs I played during the program? Who owns the copyright on ads, and is it acceptable to remove them? Radio stations and rebroadcast sites can pay a fixed fee to collection organisations like NZRIA and APRA for permission to play the songs, but they can't pass on that permission to anyone who rebroadcasts the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do to show public radio stations that libre licensing - CC or otherwise - is a good fit for their organizational mission, and help them negotiate the legal minefields around copyright? Between them, the RadioNZ, community access, and students stations have vast numbers of hours of recordings, covering a wide range of kiwi accents spoken regularly on ethnic community radio programs. Having these available under a libre license would have benefits beyond just sharing the information and perspective included in public interest radio programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also be tremendously helpful to people working on getting free code/ open source speech recognition software to recognise New Zilnd accents, which in turn would be tremendously helpful for any kiwi wanting a speech-operated computer that respects their software freedom. The same would be true for speakers of Te Reo Māori, and other Polynesian languages, who, like NZ English speakers, are also less likely to record enough speech at sites like VoxForge for them to generate a useful acoustic model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In '&lt;a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Coming Civil War over General Purpose Computing&lt;/a&gt;', Cory Doctorow asks us to consider the implications if the proprietary software running on many of our personal computers was instead running on our bionic legs;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;"If I can lo-jack your legs, I can lease them to you with the confidence of my power to repo them if you default on payments. If I can't, I may not lease you legs unless you've got a lot of money to begin with. But if your legs can decide to walk to the repo-depot without your consent, you will be totally screwed the day that muggers, rapists, griefers or the secret police figure out how to hijack that facility."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like bionic legs, accessibility tools like speech recognition and text-to-speech are augmentations which restore equalit, helping people with conditions from blindness to quadraplegia to have the full use of computers and the internet that most of us take for granted. Such essential tools should not be subject to the price pumping and hidden agendas that go with proprietary sofware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement to open up research data is gaining momentum. Both publishers and funders are starting to require researchers to publish their data at the same time as the results and conclusions they've derived from it. Most recently, the &lt;a href="http://www.msi.govt.nz/assets/Update-me/National-Science-Challenges/Request-for-proposals/RfP-1st-tranche-Oct-2013.pdf"&gt;National Science Challenges' Request for Proposals (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; requires fundees to explain how they will comply with the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/"&gt;New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework&lt;/a&gt; and provide for access to and re-use of data generated (p.13).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishing data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because publication of research data is still relatively new, it looks complicated and scary. And it can be complicated if you want it to be. A really large project might make it worth creating its own website to host the resulting dataset(s) and present them in a custom set of interfaces. [quote float="right"]Every dataset you publish, no matter how small or incomplete or imperfect, is a wheel someone else doesn't have to reinvent&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/2013/10/22/The%20National%20Science%20Challenges%20let%20you%20apply%20funding%20to%20provide%20for%20access%20to%20and%20re-use%20of%20data."&gt;/quote&lt;/a&gt; Look at &lt;a href="http://geonet.org.nz/"&gt;GeoNet&lt;/a&gt; (on the off-chance you haven't already!) for an example: it provides raw data from the quake drums, and both initial and confirmed calculations about the size and location of quakes. Data is presented pre-digested on maps for the casual visitor, and in &lt;a href="http://info.geonet.org.nz/display/appdata/Earthquake+Web+Feature+Service"&gt;open data formats&lt;/a&gt; for the more sophisticated reuser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But publication can also be as easy as spending a minute creating a &lt;a href="http://figshare.com/"&gt;figShare&lt;/a&gt; account and another minute uploading your file and adding a title and subject keywords. Click a button and your data has a permanent home and DOI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps midway are subject-specific repositories (over 600 listed on &lt;a href="http://www.re3data.org/"&gt;re3data&lt;/a&gt; alone): these tend to have more metadata/documentation requirements or other forms of quality control. &lt;a href="http://datadryad.com/"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt; has recently instigated a small data publishing charge. A number of journals are paying this charge for their authors: perhaps for the good of science, perhaps recognising that the &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/175/"&gt;data publication citation advantage&lt;/a&gt; is good for their impact factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing is a good start, but it's not the same as making the data open for reuse. Peter Desmet's &lt;a href="http://peterdesmet.com/posts/illegal-bullfrogs.html"&gt;illegal bullfrogs&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates how we lose out when data reuse is restricted, whether by intent or neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortuitously a lot of data publication venues support or require published data to be open data. FigShare and Dryad for example both require a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0"&gt;Creative Commons Zero&lt;/a&gt; licence. This lets people use the data in any application without even the need for attribution -- useful if their application pulls together data from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that this doesn't affect the scholarly norm of citing your sources, any more than the expiration of copyright means you no longer need to cite Aristotle, Murasaki, or Marie Curie. &lt;a href="http://www.datacite.org/"&gt;DataCite&lt;/a&gt;, among many others, is working on data citation standards, but the main principle is that data should be cited just as articles and books are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So publishing data is easy, and publishing data openly is easy. Publishing open data &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; is the hard thing -- just as it is for any human skill or endeavour. You start with the basics and level up according to your capacity and needs. The &lt;a href="https://certificates.theodi.org/"&gt;ODI Open Data Certification process&lt;/a&gt; is a friendly way both to recognise what level you're at and to let you know what direction you can develop in next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might, for example, start by publishing in a proprietary format like Excel, then later level up to publishing in the open CSV format, or machine-readable XML, or a chart with the data embedded behind it using a tool like &lt;a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/07/19/creating-charts-with-datawrapper/"&gt;Datawrapper&lt;/a&gt;, or a bundle of formats for different uses plus interactive visualisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first time, you might realise you don't have consent from your human participants to publish their data, so limit yourself to publishing only the data gathered by other means -- then on your next research project you might plan for data publication right from the ethics approval stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning for data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words "Data Management Plan" strike fear in the researcher's heart, conjuring up the spectre of voluminous forms full of bureacratese and technical specifications. But all it means is to ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;what data you intend to gather;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;how you'll analyse and document it;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;what ethical questions it raises and how you'll deal with those;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;how you'll store it safely and securely while you're carrying out your research;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;and what you'll do with it afterwards -- whether to publish all or part of it, archive it privately for a period, or in some cases destroy it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK's Digital Curation Centre's &lt;a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP-checklist-post-consultation-v2.pdf"&gt;2009 checklist for a data management plan (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; consisted of over 80 questions - but &lt;a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf"&gt;its most recent version (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; has only 24 (or &lt;a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/node/10020"&gt;just 13, depending how you count&lt;/a&gt;). The idea is simply to make sure you've thought about these things before beginning your project, so you don't get caught by surprise when the journal you submit to at the end of it requires you to publish your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perfect data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranganathan's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_laws_of_library_science"&gt;Five Laws of Library Science&lt;/a&gt; could easily be reapplied here, beginning: Data is for use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best data is the data that someone finds when they need it. They might have to convert it or tidy it or reanalyse it -- but if they have the data they can do all these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can thoroughly document your data, do; but if not, don't let that stop you putting your data up. If you can convert it into an open machine-readable format, do; but if not, don't let that be why it languishes on your hard drive. If you can publish all your data under a Creative Commons Zero licence, do; but if not, publish some of it, under whatever licence you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every dataset you publish, no matter how small or incomplete or imperfect, is a wheel someone else doesn't have to reinvent. Start small, but start; and keep the wheels of science turning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Data</category><category>OA Week 2013</category><category>Research</category><category>Science</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/2013/10/22/levelling-up-to-open-research-data.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2013 04:53:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Levelling Up to Open Research Data</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/levelling-open-research-data.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Deborah Fitchett, Digital Access Coordinator at Lincoln University.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement to open up research data is gaining momentum. Both publishers and funders are starting to require researchers to publish their data at the same time as the results and conclusions they've derived from it. Most recently, the &lt;a href="http://www.msi.govt.nz/assets/Update-me/National-Science-Challenges/Request-for-proposals/RfP-1st-tranche-Oct-2013.pdf"&gt;National Science Challenges' Request for Proposals (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; requires fundees to explain how they will comply with the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/"&gt;New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework&lt;/a&gt; and provide for access to and re-use of data generated (p.13).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishing data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because publication of research data is still relatively new, it looks complicated and scary. And it can be complicated if you want it to be. A really large project might make it worth creating its own website to host the resulting dataset(s) and present them in a custom set of interfaces. (The National Science Challenges let you apply funding to provide for access to and re-use of data.) Look at &lt;a href="http://geonet.org.nz/"&gt;GeoNet&lt;/a&gt; (on the off-chance you haven't already!) for an example: it provides raw data from the quake drums, and both initial and confirmed calculations about the size and location of quakes. Data is presented pre-digested on maps for the casual visitor, and in &lt;a href="http://info.geonet.org.nz/display/appdata/Earthquake+Web+Feature+Service"&gt;open data formats&lt;/a&gt; for the more sophisticated reuser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But publication can also be as easy as spending a minute creating a &lt;a href="http://figshare.com/"&gt;figShare&lt;/a&gt; account and another minute uploading your file and adding a title and subject keywords. Click a button and your data has a permanent home and DOI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps midway are subject-specific repositories (over 600 listed on &lt;a href="http://www.re3data.org/"&gt;re3data&lt;/a&gt; alone): these tend to have more metadata/documentation requirements or other forms of quality control. &lt;a href="http://datadryad.com/"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt; has recently instigated a small data publishing charge. A number of journals are paying this charge for their authors: perhaps for the good of science, perhaps recognising that the &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/175/"&gt;data publication citation advantage&lt;/a&gt; is good for their impact factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing is a good start, but it's not the same as making the data open for reuse. Peter Desmet's &lt;a href="http://peterdesmet.com/posts/illegal-bullfrogs.html"&gt;illegal bullfrogs&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates how we lose out when data reuse is restricted, whether by intent or neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortuitously a lot of data publication venues support or require published data to be open data. FigShare and Dryad for example both require a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0"&gt;Creative Commons Zero&lt;/a&gt; licence. This lets people use the data in any application without even the need for attribution -- useful if their application pulls together data from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that this doesn't affect the scholarly norm of citing your sources, any more than the expiration of copyright means you no longer need to cite Aristotle, Murasaki, or Marie Curie. &lt;a href="http://www.datacite.org/"&gt;DataCite&lt;/a&gt;, among many others, is working on data citation standards, but the main principle is that data should be cited just as articles and books are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So publishing data is easy, and publishing data openly is easy. Publishing open data &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; is the hard thing -- just as it is for any human skill or endeavour. You start with the basics and level up according to your capacity and needs. The &lt;a href="https://certificates.theodi.org/"&gt;ODI Open Data Certification process&lt;/a&gt; is a friendly way both to recognise what level you're at and to let you know what direction you can develop in next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your first time, you might realise you don't have consent from your human participants to publish their data, so limit yourself to publishing only the data gathered by other means -- then on your next research project you might plan for data publication right from the ethics approval stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In June 2011, Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) launched the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINZ Data Service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (LDS), a web-based tool which allows users to map and download LINZ data. LDS licences most of its data under a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We sat down and had a chat with Manager Jeremy Palmer and Planning and Support Advisor Vicki Lindsay to talk about where the LDS came from, what it’s currently doing, and where it might be headed in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDS was born, Jeremy says, out of the need to do two things: “first, to drive innovation in the private sector to get better reuse of our data, and second, to drive efficiencies within government agencies.” One of the operation’s key requirements, Jeremy says, was the open licensing of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href="http://nzgoal.info/"&gt;New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing&lt;/a&gt; (NZGOAL) framework, deciding to license with Creative Commons was a relatively simple process. “We brought NZGOAL into the equation early on, which allowed us to analyse our methods of licensing—previously, each dataset had its own terms, conditions and restrictions based on various levels of complex copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We concluded pretty quickly that we could relicense most of our datasets under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licences—bar a few which have legal restrictions on them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicki described the LDS experience as a “bit of a test pilot” for the implementation of the NZGOAL framework. “It was really good for us because we didn’t need to develop any licences, but could adopt a licence recognised both nationally and internationally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LINZ’s Chief Executive at the time, Colin MacDonald, was intimately involved in the cross-government programme for data and information re-use. The adoption of the NZGOAL framework was strategic decision on LINZ’s part - an opportunity for LINZ to show leadership in the open data space. Jeremy says that stakeholders and partners that contributed to the design of the service would also chip in with advice: “we were working in partnership with &lt;a href="http://koordinates.com/"&gt;Koordinates&lt;/a&gt;, who provided the technology for LDS and who are heavily involved in the open data movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the launch of the LDS, access to LINZ datasets was primarily done through manual requests and provided on DVDs—a “labour-intensive” and time consuming process. While some of these ‘legacy services’ are running alongside the LDS currently, Vicki notes they will be streamlined into the LDS in the long term. As with any major change in service delivery, the transition can take time to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jeremy says the change has been for the best: “the service is a professional service, enabling easy online access to our data via a sophisticated set of tools and functionality. In a typical week, LDS gets upwards of 500 file downloads of our datasets—which is much, much more than when our data distribution was manually administered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only has opening the datasets increased usage in numbers, it’s also invited a more diverse user-base, says Vicki. “Because it’s much more accessible now, and free to access, we are seeing our customer base grow to include smaller organisations that may not have used LINZ data before , whereas customers who used our previous services were generally professional organisations who could consume that complex data quite easily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;“It was generally very complex, so it was quite a shift in philosophy for us to go from being a raw bulk data distributor to taking that data and making it accessible to that a wider range of users” adds Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Landscape architect Nigel Cowburn, of Growplan Ltd., uses the LDS’ datasets in order to arrive at worksites to meet clients “fully armed” with information about the property and landscape as it currently exists. He says the LDS enables him to prepare ahead of time. “It’s free and reliable, and helps me ask intelligent questions,” Nigel says. “It makes the remote part of my work possible, as I have a good idea of the landscape before I go—the more information I can access online, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LDS is frequently updated to meet the needs of its customers. But as with any large operation, the project didn’t come without its obstacles. “The release and simplification of large datasets were a big challenge for us to manage—from the outset, however, by partnering with Koordinates, they had already solved some of the issues..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy notes that the service is really showing results. The number of registered users of the LINZ Data Service, currently standing at almost 6.500, continues to climb by an impressive 300 users every month. These customers, spanning government, geospatial, survey, utility, contracting, and engineering sectors and beyond, are using the LINZ Data Service to realise efficiencies, innovation and improved decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LDS’ efforts haven’t gone unrecognised. LINZ was the recipient of the &lt;em&gt;JK Barrie Award for Overall Excellence&lt;/em&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.spatialbusiness.org/aus/Upcoming-Events/Asia-Pacific-Spatial-Excellence-Awards"&gt;Asia Pacific Spatial Excellence Awards&lt;/a&gt;—the premier forum for recognising the spatial information industry’s top performers. Of the award, &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/news-publications-and-consultations/news-and-notices/lds-named-asia-pacific%E2%80%99s-best-of-the-best"&gt;LINZ Chief Executive Peter Mersi&lt;/a&gt; says “it is recognition of the highest order of the value of developing and implementing an easy-to-use geospatial data sharing service.” Mersi says LDS has played a part in “revolutionising the way people can discover, use and share New Zealand public data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy notes that Australians are “envious of the openness of the whole ecosystem” that LDS uses. “In Australia, the multiple levels of government have imposed a model where they’re trying to still do cost recovery for their assets. The fact that we were able to remove barriers with Creative Commons licences really made an impact and helped us win that award. Over there, a lot of their data is still very locked up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quizzed about their advice to other government agencies considering using open licencing, both Jeremy and Vicki are supportive of the measures. “I’d definitely recommend opening access to public, non -private information across government. If there’s a mandate to adopt open licensing, and you want to get it done, NZGOAL and Creative Commons licences get really good results and can reduce timeframes to actually just get the data out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Data</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/linz-data-service.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Sep 2013 09:51:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>LINZ Data Service</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/2013/09/17/linz-data-service.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;By Josh Wright&lt;/h5&gt;

The fact that we were able to remove barriers with Creative Commons licences really made an impact and helped us win that award. Over there, a lot of their data is still very locked up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quizzed about their advice to other government agencies considering using open licencing, both Jeremy and Vicki are supportive of the measures. “I’d definitely recommend opening access to public, non -private  information across government. If there’s a mandate to adopt open licensing, and you want to get it done, NZGOAL and Creative Commons licences get really good results and can reduce timeframes to actually just get the data out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Data</category><category>Government</category><category>Science</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/2013/09/17/linz-data-service.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2013 23:35:43 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
