&lt;p&gt;Come along and hear from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kaythaney" target="_blank"&gt;Kaitlin Thaney&lt;/a&gt;, Director of Mozilla Science Lab about the future of open research practice. We will also hear from people in universities, government, and the private sector who are active in open practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a inaugural director of the Mozilla Science Lab Kaitlin Thaney fosters an ongoing dialogue between the open web community and researchers, highlighting the need for the development of essential skills for data science and how these skills can create new opportunities within and beyond specific research areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously Kaitlin was an advisor for the UK government on digital infrastructure and data science and she currently has a strong focus on the development of policy around digital science, data, and open practices. Kaitlin is also on the board of Directors of Datakind UK, a not-for-profit organisation that ‘does good with data’ by bringing together leading data scientists with societal good organizations to make data work in service of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;eaturing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;This is a piece from a member the Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ community., and is licensed CC-BY-SA. If you want to write for us, please email matt@creativecommons.org.nz.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Land Information New Zealand officials, prompted by the support in NZGOAL for free culture CC licenses, started liberating the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/09/linz-data-service/" target="_blank"&gt;publicly-funded map data they hold&lt;/a&gt; under CC-BY, they may have anticipated that their data could end up in OpenStreetMap.org (OSM). OSM is the libre licensed, crowdsourced, world mapping project (formerly CC-BY-SA, now Open DataBase License) created as a free-as-in-speech alternative to Google Maps, which licenses copyright map and image data from other companies. What they probably never imagined was their data appearing on community sites like the new NSW government funded &lt;a href="http://www.timebanking.com.au/" target="_blank"&gt;TimeBanking platform&lt;/a&gt; and in maps powered by Leafet, the free code, mobile-friendly, web map engine which uses OSM as the default source for map data. Such are the unintended benefits that flow from sharing in the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-6030" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg" alt="X" width="546" height="366"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Screenshot of &lt;a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/1910-otago-075m-rural-aerial-photos-2004-2011/" target="_blank"&gt;Otago 0.75m aerial photography&lt;/a&gt; by LINZ. Made available under a Creative Commons Attribution licence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as OSM contributed to the development of websites using Leaflet, the cultural commons also has a contribution to make to the development of free code speech recognition software. Douglas Bagnall gave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BGLrLXm3c" target="_blank"&gt;a great talk&lt;/a&gt; about free code speech recognition engines at Kiwi PyCon 2012, and one of the main non-coding challenges he identified is the lack of a suitably large corpus of spoken speech with which to train' the software (the interesting bits for non-coders starts at about 3:00), particularly for less common accents like New Zealand English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas mentioned a site called VoxForge.org and encouraged us all to record some speech for it. VoxForge collects samples of speech to "compile them into acoustic models for use with Open Source speech recognition engines", with both the acoustic models and the source data are made available under the GNU General Public License, the free code software license used by the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voxforge is a great resource, but it would be a lot of work to drive enough 'Nu Zylnd' accented speakers there. and it occurred to me recently that there is another source of spoken speech for which there is strong argument for libre licensing; public interest radio. Releasing audio programs made for National Radio, student radio, and community access radio, under a libre license (eg CC-BY), has always seemed like a no-brainer to me. Even before I set up &lt;a href="http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/05/07/cc-nz@groups.creativecommons.org.nz" target="_blank"&gt;the CC-NZ email list&lt;/a&gt;, I was contacting community radio people and telling them about the potential benefits of podcasting and CC licensing for increasing program exposure, as part of my work with Aotearoa.Indymedia.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Radio are publicly-owned and funded, and currently podcast all their programs in both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats. Student radio stations have also been experimenting with recording their shows and turning them into podcasts, and if they libre licensed the sometimes substantial spoken word parts of recordings like &lt;a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/radio1/" target="_blank"&gt;the Radio1 shows shared on MixCloud&lt;/a&gt;, they'd be unlikely to miss out on any commercial return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community access radio stations, as their name suggests, exist to give special interest groups in our communities access to the airwaves, so their unique voices have a chance to be heard in broadcast media. Access stations are heavily subsidised by public broadcasting funding, and their programs aren't expected to have commercial potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever these programs are rebroadcast, both the program producers, and the public who subsidize their production, get more bang for their buck. Over the last decade or so, access radio stations have been building up the infrastructure to digitally record programs, so they can be made available as podcasts, on sites like accessradio.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I notice in all three cases though, is that despite NZGOAL-inspired wave of CC license adoptions across public service organisations from LINZ, to schools and tertiary institutions, to archives and museums, I see no sign of CC licenses on locally made radio so far. I'm guessing one issue is legal confusion and risk aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if I want to CC my radio program, what about the copyright songs I played during the program? Who owns the copyright on ads, and is it acceptable to remove them? Radio stations and rebroadcast sites can pay a fixed fee to collection organisations like NZRIA and APRA for permission to play the songs, but they can't pass on that permission to anyone who rebroadcasts the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do to show public radio stations that libre licensing - CC or otherwise - is a good fit for their organizational mission, and help them negotiate the legal minefields around copyright? Between them, the RadioNZ, community access, and students stations have vast numbers of hours of recordings, covering a wide range of kiwi accents spoken regularly on ethnic community radio programs. Having these available under a libre license would have benefits beyond just sharing the information and perspective included in public interest radio programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also be tremendously helpful to people working on getting free code/ open source speech recognition software to recognise New Zilnd accents, which in turn would be tremendously helpful for any kiwi wanting a speech-operated computer that respects their software freedom. The same would be true for speakers of Te Reo Māori, and other Polynesian languages, who, like NZ English speakers, are also less likely to record enough speech at sites like VoxForge for them to generate a useful acoustic model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In '&lt;a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Coming Civil War over General Purpose Computing&lt;/a&gt;', Cory Doctorow asks us to consider the implications if the proprietary software running on many of our personal computers was instead running on our bionic legs;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;"If I can lo-jack your legs, I can lease them to you with the confidence of my power to repo them if you default on payments. If I can't, I may not lease you legs unless you've got a lot of money to begin with. But if your legs can decide to walk to the repo-depot without your consent, you will be totally screwed the day that muggers, rapists, griefers or the secret police figure out how to hijack that facility."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like bionic legs, accessibility tools like speech recognition and text-to-speech are augmentations which restore equalit, helping people with conditions from blindness to quadraplegia to have the full use of computers and the internet that most of us take for granted. Such essential tools should not be subject to the price pumping and hidden agendas that go with proprietary sofware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement to open up research data is gaining momentum. Both publishers and funders are starting to require researchers to publish their data at the same time as the results and conclusions they've derived from it. Most recently, the &lt;a href="http://www.msi.govt.nz/assets/Update-me/National-Science-Challenges/Request-for-proposals/RfP-1st-tranche-Oct-2013.pdf"&gt;National Science Challenges' Request for Proposals (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; requires fundees to explain how they will comply with the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/"&gt;New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework&lt;/a&gt; and provide for access to and re-use of data generated (p.13).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishing data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because publication of research data is still relatively new, it looks complicated and scary. And it can be complicated if you want it to be. A really large project might make it worth creating its own website to host the resulting dataset(s) and present them in a custom set of interfaces. [quote float="right"]Every dataset you publish, no matter how small or incomplete or imperfect, is a wheel someone else doesn't have to reinvent&lt;a href="http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/10/22/The%20National%20Science%20Challenges%20let%20you%20apply%20funding%20to%20provide%20for%20access%20to%20and%20re-use%20of%20data."&gt;/quote&lt;/a&gt; Look at &lt;a href="http://geonet.org.nz/"&gt;GeoNet&lt;/a&gt; (on the off-chance you haven't already!) for an example: it provides raw data from the quake drums, and both initial and confirmed calculations about the size and location of quakes. Data is presented pre-digested on maps for the casual visitor, and in &lt;a href="http://info.geonet.org.nz/display/appdata/Earthquake+Web+Feature+Service"&gt;open data formats&lt;/a&gt; for the more sophisticated reuser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But publication can also be as easy as spending a minute creating a &lt;a href="http://figshare.com/"&gt;figShare&lt;/a&gt; account and another minute uploading your file and adding a title and subject keywords. Click a button and your data has a permanent home and DOI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps midway are subject-specific repositories (over 600 listed on &lt;a href="http://www.re3data.org/"&gt;re3data&lt;/a&gt; alone): these tend to have more metadata/documentation requirements or other forms of quality control. &lt;a href="http://datadryad.com/"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt; has recently instigated a small data publishing charge. A number of journals are paying this charge for their authors: perhaps for the good of science, perhaps recognising that the &lt;a href="https://peerj.com/articles/175/"&gt;data publication citation advantage&lt;/a&gt; is good for their impact factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing is a good start, but it's not the same as making the data open for reuse. Peter Desmet's &lt;a href="http://peterdesmet.com/posts/illegal-bullfrogs.html"&gt;illegal bullfrogs&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates how we lose out when data reuse is restricted, whether by intent or neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortuitously a lot of data publication venues support or require published data to be open data. FigShare and Dryad for example both require a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0"&gt;Creative Commons Zero&lt;/a&gt; licence. This lets people use the data in any application without even the need for attribution -- useful if their application pulls together data from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that this doesn't affect the scholarly norm of citing your sources, any more than the expiration of copyright means you no longer need to cite Aristotle, Murasaki, or Marie Curie. &lt;a href="http://www.datacite.org/"&gt;DataCite&lt;/a&gt;, among many others, is working on data citation standards, but the main principle is that data should be cited just as articles and books are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So publishing data is easy, and publishing data openly is easy. Publishing open data &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; is the hard thing -- just as it is for any human skill or endeavour. You start with the basics and level up according to your capacity and needs. The &lt;a href="https://certificates.theodi.org/"&gt;ODI Open Data Certification process&lt;/a&gt; is a friendly way both to recognise what level you're at and to let you know what direction you can develop in next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might, for example, start by publishing in a proprietary format like Excel, then later level up to publishing in the open CSV format, or machine-readable XML, or a chart with the data embedded behind it using a tool like &lt;a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/07/19/creating-charts-with-datawrapper/"&gt;Datawrapper&lt;/a&gt;, or a bundle of formats for different uses plus interactive visualisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first time, you might realise you don't have consent from your human participants to publish their data, so limit yourself to publishing only the data gathered by other means -- then on your next research project you might plan for data publication right from the ethics approval stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planning for data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words "Data Management Plan" strike fear in the researcher's heart, conjuring up the spectre of voluminous forms full of bureacratese and technical specifications. But all it means is to ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;what data you intend to gather;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;how you'll analyse and document it;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;what ethical questions it raises and how you'll deal with those;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;how you'll store it safely and securely while you're carrying out your research;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;and what you'll do with it afterwards -- whether to publish all or part of it, archive it privately for a period, or in some cases destroy it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK's Digital Curation Centre's &lt;a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP-checklist-post-consultation-v2.pdf"&gt;2009 checklist for a data management plan (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; consisted of over 80 questions - but &lt;a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf"&gt;its most recent version (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; has only 24 (or &lt;a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/node/10020"&gt;just 13, depending how you count&lt;/a&gt;). The idea is simply to make sure you've thought about these things before beginning your project, so you don't get caught by surprise when the journal you submit to at the end of it requires you to publish your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perfect data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranganathan's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_laws_of_library_science"&gt;Five Laws of Library Science&lt;/a&gt; could easily be reapplied here, beginning: Data is for use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best data is the data that someone finds when they need it. They might have to convert it or tidy it or reanalyse it -- but if they have the data they can do all these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can thoroughly document your data, do; but if not, don't let that stop you putting your data up. If you can convert it into an open machine-readable format, do; but if not, don't let that be why it languishes on your hard drive. If you can publish all your data under a Creative Commons Zero licence, do; but if not, publish some of it, under whatever licence you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every dataset you publish, no matter how small or incomplete or imperfect, is a wheel someone else doesn't have to reinvent. Start small, but start; and keep the wheels of science turning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Data</category><category>OA Week 2013</category><category>Research</category><category>Science</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/10/22/levelling-up-to-open-research-data.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2013 04:53:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>LINZ Data Service</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/09/17/linz-data-service.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;By Josh Wright&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In June 2011, Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) launched the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINZ Data Service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (LDS), a web-based tool which allows users to map and download LINZ data. LDS licences most of its data under a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We sat down and had a chat with Manager Jeremy Palmer and Planning and Support Advisor Vicki Lindsay to talk about where the LDS came from, what it’s currently doing, and where it might be headed in the future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDS was born, Jeremy says, out of the need to do two things: “first, to drive innovation in the private sector to get better reuse of our data, and second, to drive efficiencies within government agencies.” One of the operation’s key requirements, Jeremy says, was the open licensing of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href="http://nzgoal.info/"&gt;New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing&lt;/a&gt; (NZGOAL) framework, deciding to license with Creative Commons was a relatively simple process. “We brought NZGOAL into the equation early on, which allowed us to analyse our methods of licensing—previously, each dataset had its own terms, conditions and restrictions based on various levels of complex copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We concluded pretty quickly that we could relicense most of our datasets under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licences—bar a few which have legal restrictions on them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Topo501.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-4293" title="Topo50" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Topo501-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Screenshot of '&lt;a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/#/layer/767-nz-mainland-topo50-maps/" target="_blank"&gt;NZ Mainland Topo50 Maps&lt;/a&gt;' by LINZ Data Service. Made available under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand Licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicki described the LDS experience as a “bit of a test pilot” for the implementation of the NZGOAL framework. “It was really good for us because we didn’t need to develop any licences, but could adopt a licence recognised both nationally and internationally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LINZ’s Chief Executive at the time, Colin MacDonald, was intimately involved in the cross-government programme for data and information re-use. The adoption of the NZGOAL framework was strategic decision on LINZ’s part - an opportunity for LINZ to show leadership in the open data space.  Jeremy says that stakeholders and partners that contributed to the design of the service would also chip in with advice: “we were  working in partnership with &lt;a href="http://koordinates.com/"&gt;Koordinates&lt;/a&gt;, who provided the technology for LDS and who are heavily involved in the open data movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the launch of the LDS, access to LINZ datasets was primarily done through manual requests and provided on DVDs—a “labour-intensive” and time consuming process. While some of these ‘legacy services’ are running alongside the LDS currently, Vicki notes they will be streamlined into the LDS in the long term. As with any  major change in service delivery, the transition can take time to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jeremy says the change has been for the best: “the service is a professional service, enabling easy online access to our data via a sophisticated set of tools and functionality. In a typical week, LDS gets upwards of 500 file downloads of our datasets—which is much, much more than when our data distribution was manually administered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only has opening the datasets increased usage in numbers, it’s also invited a more diverse user-base, says Vicki. “Because it’s much more accessible now, and free to access, we are seeing our customer base grow to include smaller organisations that may not have used LINZ data before  , whereas customers who used our previous services were generally professional organisations who could consume that complex data quite easily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/LDS-Layer.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4287 " title="LDS Layer" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/LDS-Layer-1024x644.png" alt="" width="485" height="304"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Screenshot of '&lt;a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/#/layer/804-nz-property-titles/" target="_blank"&gt;NZ Property Titles&lt;/a&gt;' by LINZ Data Service.

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;“It was generally very complex, so it was quite a shift in philosophy for us to go from being a raw bulk data distributor to taking that data and making it accessible to that a wider range of users” adds Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;Landscape architect Nigel Cowburn, of Growplan Ltd., uses the LDS’ datasets in order to arrive at worksites to meet clients “fully armed” with information about the property and landscape as it currently exists.  He says the LDS enables him to prepare ahead of time. “It’s free and reliable, and helps me ask intelligent questions,” Nigel says. “It makes the remote part of my work possible, as I have a good idea of the landscape before I go—the more information I can access online, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;LDS is frequently updated to meet the needs of its customers. But as with any large operation, the project didn’t come without its obstacles. “The release and simplification of large datasets were a big challenge for us to manage—from the outset, however, by partnering with Koordinates, they had already solved some of the issues..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy notes that the service is really showing results. The number of registered users of the LINZ Data Service, currently standing at almost 6.500, continues to climb by an impressive 300 users every month. These customers, spanning government, geospatial, survey, utility, contracting, and engineering sectors and beyond, are using the LINZ Data Service to realise efficiencies, innovation and improved decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LDS’ efforts haven’t gone unrecognised. LINZ was the recipient of the &lt;em&gt;JK Barrie Award for Overall Excellence&lt;/em&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.spatialbusiness.org/aus/Upcoming-Events/Asia-Pacific-Spatial-Excellence-Awards"&gt;Asia Pacific Spatial Excellence Awards&lt;/a&gt;—the premier forum for recognising the spatial information industry’s top performers. Of the award, &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/news-publications-and-consultations/news-and-notices/lds-named-asia-pacific%E2%80%99s-best-of-the-best"&gt;LINZ Chief Executive Peter Mersi&lt;/a&gt; says “it is recognition of the highest order of the value of developing and implementing an easy-to-use geospatial data sharing service.” Mersi says LDS has played a part in “revolutionising the way people can discover, use and share New Zealand public data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy notes that Australians are “envious of the openness of the whole ecosystem” that LDS uses. “In Australia, the multiple levels of government have imposed a model where they’re trying to still do cost recovery for their assets. The fact that we were able to remove barriers with Creative Commons licences really made an impact and helped us win that award. Over there, a lot of their data is still very locked up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quizzed about their advice to other government agencies considering using open licencing, both Jeremy and Vicki are supportive of the measures. “I’d definitely recommend opening access to public, non -private  information across government. If there’s a mandate to adopt open licensing, and you want to get it done, NZGOAL and Creative Commons licences get really good results and can reduce timeframes to actually just get the data out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Data</category><category>Government</category><category>Science</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/09/17/linz-data-service.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2013 23:35:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Statistics NZ</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/09/01/statistics-nz.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his blog &lt;a href="http://davegiles.blogspot.co.nz/2012/05/disappearing-historical-data.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Econometrics Beat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Canadian economist David E Giles describes the open presentation of &lt;a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/"&gt;Statistics New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;’s (SNZ) data online: “&lt;em&gt;This isn’t just a collection of boring spreadsheets. It’s a valuable and serious piece of data research&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s right—SNZ have been pioneers in maximising transparency through the open licensing of many of their datasets, which they release online through web-based applications &lt;em&gt;NZ.Stat&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Infoshare.&lt;/em&gt; While SNZ is best known to the public for their management of the census, their remit stretches beyond just this—and they use open licences on much of their data to ensure it has maximum reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic for SNZ is simple. Releasing data in an open framework helps for a range of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;it makes it easier for government agencies to work together;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;it reduces the cost of providing an existing government service, with decreased paperwork and hoops to jump through;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;it maximises access and visibility to users, attracting new customers;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;and it reduces the cost of accessing and processing information for existing users.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programmes/open-and-transparent-government/open-data-case-studies/"&gt;Open Government Information and Data Re-use Work Programme&lt;/a&gt; has written up some case studies about how SNZ has released data in an open format. Given these case studies are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licences themselves, we thought it would be good to summarise them for a wider public audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Census data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Census data is what most of the public know SNZ for. Through their website, SNZ has released blocks of census data from 1996, 2001, and 2006 under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licences. These datasets—which include information on age, ethnicity, income, workplace, dwelling size and geography—can be organised online and then downloaded in a variety of formats for remix and re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/notbrucelee/5241176871/" rel="attachment wp-att-4268"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-4268 " src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/cc.large2_-300x246.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="246"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Open Government Data Venn Diagram by justgrimes. Licensed under CC BY-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dedicated team works to develop Census datasets for phased release. The team is constantly looking for ways to improve: for each new census recorded, changes and improvements in the range of datasets available are made based on user feedback. While the 2011 Census was delayed because of the Christchurch earthquake, data from this year’s Census will be available from December onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic indicators data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SNZ also release economic datasets, which detail New Zealand’s gross domestic product, consumer price index, balance of payments, and productivity—all on a quarterly basis. This data is freely available for public and business through web-based tools that aid in the preparation and formatting of datasets for open use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening economic indicator data has been a great step for SNZ’s  visibility and usefulness to New Zealand. Businesses, government agencies, community organisations, and research institutions use the data to direct their research and development and to inform their decision-making at all levels—making New Zealand a savvier, better-informed, and ultimately more prosperous place to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Tier 1’ statistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These statistics, released online through SNZ’s web-based applications, describe New Zealand’s economy, environment, population, society, culture, international relations, and civil and political rights. Government, businesses, and members of the public use these statistics to make informed decisions and monitor the state and progress of New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So—what makes them ‘Tier 1’? They are consistent, of high quality, and have integrity. This is why they are the priority for the government’s statistical production. Tier 1 statistics are optimal for public, wide use, which is why it’s important that they are published in a way that allows for equal and open access. Like the other data services, Tier 1 statistics are delivered through a broad range of formats, including in reports, as aggregate data, and (with some restrictions) as microdata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it all released?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to actually get data from their systems into customers’ hands, SNZ use their online data tools &lt;em&gt;Infoshare &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;NZ.Stat&lt;/em&gt;, which were implemented through the Making Information Freely Available programme in 2008-09. &lt;em&gt;Infoshare&lt;/em&gt;, designed in consultation with users to facilitate open databases, was the successor to &lt;em&gt;INFOS&lt;/em&gt;, a closed subscription system that had only 90 consistent subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SNZ’s decision to open up their data through web-based data retrieval applications has seen user numbers increase from 90 to over 100,000 in 2011-12. Not only are these web-based applications user-friendly, they allow customers to organise their data to suit them—presenting information in different formats to meet the needs of a diversity of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think this is a pretty neat use of open licensing—kudos to SNZ for showing the initiative!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Data</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/09/01/statistics-nz.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 05:14:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Open Data Case Studies</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/08/08/open-data-case-studies.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;By Josh Wright&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework was approved by Cabinet in 2010, NZ government agencies have released nearly 2000 datasets to &lt;a href="https://data.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;data.govt.nz&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of reasons for this to happen. First, open data is more efficient, as it makes it easier (and cheaper) for thousands of New Zealand data users -- both inside and outside of government -- to do their job. Second, open data make it easier to find out just what New Zealand government agencies actually do; that is to say, open data makes government more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are, we think, sufficient reasons to justify the open release of public data. But open data also enables the development of new tools and services,  tools and services that wouldn't have otherwise been produced. Over the last few years, the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programmes/open-and-transparent-government/open-government-information-and-data-work-programm/"&gt;Open Government Information and Data Re-use Work Programme&lt;/a&gt; has written about some of these innovative cases of open data reuse. As these case studies are made available under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution licence&lt;/a&gt;, we've decided to summarise them for a non-government audience. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANZ Truckometer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/0003-Coal-trucks-Greymouth-maybe.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-4241" title="0003 Coal trucks - Greymouth (maybe)" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/0003-Coal-trucks-Greymouth-maybe.jpg" alt="" width="308" height="238"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; "Coal Trucks, Greymouth (maybe)" by &lt;a href="http://www.vcbrowne.com/Detailprom.aspx?RID=PB0903&amp;amp;PID=3" target="_blank"&gt;VC Browne &amp;amp; Son&lt;/a&gt;, via DigitalNZ. No known copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://anz.co.nz/commercial-institutional/economic-markets-research/truckometer/"&gt;ANZ Truckometer&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href="http://www.nzta.govt.nz/"&gt;New Zealand Transport Agency&lt;/a&gt; traffic volume data to predict economic growth or decline. Focusing on key traffic routes, ANZ’s research has found that analysing traffic flows gives a forecast on New Zealand’s economic direction—and is accurate six months into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Truckometer benefits both ANZ and its customers: customers gain accurate insights into economic forecasts, which in turn bolsters confidence in ANZ. Moreover, ANZ’s data analysis has helped identify and fix errors in the original traffic volume dataset—proof of the benefits to government departments in placing their datasets under open licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government ministries themselves have been creating avenues for the release and dissemination of openly licenced government data. Seeking to make school information more available, the &lt;a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/"&gt;Ministry of Education&lt;/a&gt;’s (MoE) &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/nz-schools/id507340099?mt=8"&gt;NZSchools&lt;/a&gt; app re-uses data from the MoE, the Historic Places Trust (HPT), and the Education Review Office (ERO) mashed into a user-friendly, navigable Google Maps framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NZSchools provides parents, students and educators with basic school information, including decile and total roll; displays school enrolment zones and bus routes; and links ERO reports to schools, amongst other features. However, app use has grown wider than just this: it is also used by real estate companies to display school zoning, and by news media to show data and graphics from the app. The MoE, ERO and HPT all benefit from a wider dissemination and greater visibility of their already-open datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Land Information New Zealand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the NZSchools app was made in-house, other government agencies have licenced their data openly with the intention that third parties utilise it. &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/"&gt;Land Information New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; (LINZ) releases its &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/hydro/tidal-info/tide-tables/"&gt;tide prediction data&lt;/a&gt;, which is used by a range of mobile and desktop app developers. These  apps, which include QuickTide, NZ Tides, and TidePlan, broadcast up-to-date data in an accessible, clear format ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tides data is also used by &lt;a href="http://www.metservice.com/national/home"&gt;MetService&lt;/a&gt; on their public weather website and on their page in daily newspapers. The broadcasting of up-to-date, accurate data allows people who use the sea—whether commercially or recreationally—to make good risk management decisions, keeping people healthy and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pocket Ranger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-ranger/id475605299?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8"&gt;Pocket Ranger&lt;/a&gt; is a smartphone app primarily concerned with user safety. Developed by the &lt;a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/"&gt;Department of Conservation&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with &lt;a href="http://www.tongariro.org.nz/"&gt;Project Tongariro&lt;/a&gt;, Pocket Ranger relies on open data made available by  DOC to give users descriptions of the tracks, points of interest, photographs, maps and safety information in and around the national park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app uses QR codes placed on stands to provide location-based information to walkers in the park. These sit in lieu of traditional signs, which have a more significant impact on the natural environment. The next release of the app will have GPS integration, aimed at creating even greater accessibility, and further enhancing user safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Data</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/08/08/open-data-case-studies.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2013 03:19:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Ministry for the Environment</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/07/22/ministry-for-the-environment.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;By Holly Grover&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2009, the &lt;a href="http://www.mfe.govt.nz/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ministry for the Environment&lt;/a&gt; started to release its datasets under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution&lt;/a&gt; licence, becoming one of the first New Zealand government agencies to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process started in 2007, when  MfE found themselves with a range of expiring license agreements for the distribution of some of their datasets. These databases were distributed and managed by a third party, who would charge a fee, register users, then get people to sign a license agreement before receiving the data. It was, in the words of Karl Majorhazi GISP-AP – Senior Analyst, simply “the way things were done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/REC-Layer-Koordinates.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4165 " title="REC Layer Koordinates" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/REC-Layer-Koordinates-1024x543.png" alt="" width="430" height="228"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Screenshot from &lt;a href="http://koordinates.com/#/layer/1623-rec-wellington/" target="_blank"&gt;River Environment Classification, Wellington&lt;/a&gt;, by the Ministry of Education, via Koordinates. Made available under a &lt;a href="http://http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But it’s not what we wanted,” Karl explains, “because when you invest in a database, the value of that is related to the number of users and uses it’s put to. So in the five years that that distribution agreement had been running, there were 99 registered users. And when you are looking to fund an update and you’ve only got 99 users it doesn’t make the maths look good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, the State Services Commission was beginning to look into the use of Creative Commons licenses. Karl sat in on SSC meeting with&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/" target="_blank"&gt; Creative Commons Australia&lt;/a&gt; Project Lead Anne Fitzgerald, of the Queensland University of Technology Faculty of Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this meeting, the decision to move to Creative Commons licensing was rather straightforward.  “We tested it out, got some advice on what it is, what it could be used for what it couldn’t, and eventually we came to the decision that this was the way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second piece of the puzzle was an online data platform &lt;a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/4317-environmental-limiting-factors/#/maps/environment/"&gt;Koordinates&lt;/a&gt;, launched only a few months earlier, which provided an easy way to search, sort, and share the datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry’s first release was on 1 July 2009, and it didn’t take long for the data to be used in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had a request from a company in Germany who were making a flight simulator app for the iPhone, who wanted to know if they could use the Landcover database in their system to give a more feature rich environment for anyone that’s flying over the country.” Of course, they didn’t need to ask as, unlike past arrangements, “the license terms and conditions mean there’s no reason why they can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/land/land-cover-dbase/" target="_blank"&gt;The Landcover database&lt;/a&gt; went from 99 registered users to over 2000 downloads, as researchers, students and members of the public began to freely use the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Karl had a phone call from someone “who was looking at the watershed data that we provide as part of the Marine Environment Classification. He was using that for a search and rescue project, using the watersheds to determine where people get lost and found. That’s one of these unintended reuses that you don’t plan for when you are developing this database.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl notes that one of the downsides of open data platforms is that you are unable to track users. Nevertheless, there have been several other exciting examples of high-value reuse of Ministry for the Environment data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Karl explains, “I turned up at a seminar and a colleague of mine came bounding over from the other side of the room with a big smile on his face and said ‘I’ve got a good news story for you!’ He operates a small consultancy and he was asked to turn around a quick analysis for parliament on how much it would roughly cost to dig trenches along side roads motorways to lay broadband cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He couldn’t get access to the soil information from Landcare at the time because it was it was under wraps commercially, but he found a piece of research that tied to it the attributes in the Land Environment dataset. He managed to download that dataset, use it in his analysis and turn that job around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is a case where people could do the job they needed to do because the data was already there – it’s an argument for being proactive, not waiting until somebody requests it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Data</category><category>Science</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/07/22/ministry-for-the-environment.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2013 01:44:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>More Open Data</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/07/01/more-open-data.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week saw the release of the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programmes/open-and-transparent-government/declaration-open-and-transparent-government/2013-report-adoption-declaration/" target="_blank"&gt;2013 Report on Agency Adoption of the Declaration on Open and Transparent Government&lt;/a&gt;, which directs all Public Service departments (and others) to release their high value public data under a Creative Commons licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report noted that agency uptake of NZGOAL is steadily increasing, with sixty-nine percent of planned data releases to be licensed for legal reuse. Eighty-four percent of departments are including the Declaration in their core business planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Beehive.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-4038 " title="Beehive" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Beehive.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="231"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; "Beehive, Wellington, NZ" by Stewart Baird, via &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sxbaird/6256220109/sizes/z/in/photostream/" target="_blank"&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt;. Made available under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution Non Commerical No Derivatives licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good news. The potential effects of the open data programme, as stated in the Declaration itself, go far beyond the open data community. As the Declaration puts it, the point of releasing open data is “to enable the private and community sectors to use it to grow the economy, strengthen our social and cultural fabric, and sustain our environment. We release it to encourage business and community involvement in government decision-making.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, more open data is a Good Thing. But where can it be found? The first place to look for open government datasets is the appropriately named &lt;a href="https://data.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;data.govt.nz&lt;/a&gt;. While data.govt.nz doesn’t host any datasets, it links to over 2300 datasets on other government websites; nearly 2000 of these are made available under a Creative Commons licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The datasets give a range of information about New Zealand, including &lt;a href="https://data.govt.nz/dataset/show/3230" target="_blank"&gt;2013 Budget Data&lt;/a&gt; from Treasury to&lt;a href="https://data.govt.nz/dataset/show/3073" target="_blank"&gt; Child and Youth Prosecution Statistics&lt;/a&gt; from the Ministry of Justice. More than half the datasets are provided by Land Information New Zealand, with many more datasets provided by Statistics New Zealand and Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sources of open data and content include &lt;a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;DigitalNZ&lt;/a&gt;, which links to 120 content partners across the country, and the award-winning &lt;a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;LINZ Data Service&lt;/a&gt;, which allows users to 'layer' datasets onto an Open Street Map. We also have the folks at &lt;a href="http://wikinewzealand.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Wiki New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;--we profiled &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/02/wiki-new-zealand/" target="_blank"&gt;WikiNZ here&lt;/a&gt;--who make a range of graphs from open government data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't find what you need, go to data.govt.nz and &lt;a href="https://data.govt.nz/requests/" target="_blank"&gt;make a request&lt;/a&gt;; otherwise, go to &lt;a href="https://fyi.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;FYI.org.nz&lt;/a&gt; to make a request under the Official Information Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you make anything with the data you find--or even save time and energy by finding what you need--we'd love &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/contact/" target="_blank"&gt;to hear about it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Data</category><category>Government</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/07/01/more-open-data.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2013 04:12:57 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
