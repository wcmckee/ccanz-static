&lt;p&gt;A OER sprint - known as a hack weekend in the technology community - is where a group of enthusiastic volunteers get together to make new open educational resources in a short period of time (that's the 'sprint' part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resources are then made available to everyone, for free, under an open Creative Commons licence, allowing others to copy, adapt and reuse (that's the 'open' part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't a new idea. One inspiring project was &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34643" target="_blank"&gt;the Oppikirjamaraton&lt;/a&gt;, in which a group of thirty maths teachers wrote a new high school textbook &lt;em&gt;in five hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer to home, &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/02/announcing-the-creative-commons-media-studies-textbook/" target="_blank"&gt;the Media Text Hack&lt;/a&gt; saw a group of educators create a free and open Media Studies undergraduate textbook in a weekend (now an assigned textbook at the University of Otago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, which resources will be made? That's entirely up to the teams that take part. We've already contacted the associations for English, Digital Technologies and Science teachers, and other associations are welcome to jump on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're keen to get involved, fill out the form, below, and we'll keep you in the loop. You can also join our Loomio group, where we'll be doing most of the organising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're holding weekly Google Hangouts for those working in the schools sector who are keen to discuss and learn more about copyright and CC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Google Hangouts are limited to ten participants, we'll do our best to take and publish notes from each call, so those who can't make it can follow along. As we go, we'll also fold common questions into new print and online resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up using the form below and we'll invite you to the Hangout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you're invited, add an agenda item -- either a topic for discussion, or a question -- to &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jUatHDt5ARFSgr4WI3VgmUPeCx1MM2Z3bBsKIP_wbWI/edit" target="_blank"&gt;the collaborative note-taking document here&lt;/a&gt;. Every call is currently slated to start with a very short introduction to CC, which can be shortened or lengthened depending on who signs up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're experimenting with two times: one after school, and one during lunchtime (which is likely to change from school to school). If one time proves more popular than the other, we'll make the necessary adjustments. If we haven't got the times right, let us know, and we'll add some more sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that schools are busy places, so if you can only come for part of the scheduled time, that's fine - you're still more than welcome to join us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is a new idea, we're very keen for your feedback. Please let us know what you think: matt@creativecommons.org.nz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These events will be a chance to discuss how Creative Commons is being used across New Zealand's school and GLAM sectors. Our schools and GLAM organisations make and look after an extraordinary amount of high-quality works, and we think that there are massive social, cultural and economic benefits to sharing this work more openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we have events planned Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Hawkes Bay, New Plymouth, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Wellington, Nelson, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Westport. But we're keen to do even more! If you want CC to come to your organisation or region, and can help us find a venue and an audience, we'll be sure to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're keen to attend any of these events, please fill out the form below! There are more details regarding times, dates, venues and speakers on &lt;a title="Creative Commons Roadtrip – GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/"&gt;GLAM events here&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a title="Creative Commons Roadtrip – Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/"&gt;schools events here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to our partners, Land Information New Zealand and InternetNZ, for enabling us to hold these events. Also, a big thanks to LIANZA and Te Papa for partnering with us on the GLAM events.&lt;/p&gt;

On 20 February 2013, Taupaki School’s Board of Trustees passed a Creative Commons policy, giving permission to Taupaki’s teachers to share and collaborate, legally.
&lt;p&gt;Paula Hogg has been the chair of the Taupaki BoT since 2012, and oversaw the passage of the Creative Commons policy. As Paula explains, the idea for the policy was initially introduced by the school’s principal, Stephen Lethbridge. While the BoT didn’t have any specific expertise on copyright or intellectual property, Stephen ensured that they had all the necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got a great letter from Stephen outlining all the issues, and following that we put it on the agenda for the next meeting. Stephen provided a lot of information for us to read prior to that meeting, so we felt quite well prepared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, copyright and intellectual property were new issues for the BoT. As Paula says, “Creative Commons was something we’d never heard of -- it wasn’t even on the periphery. While we were aware of copyright laws, we were not as well informed around exactly what was Board and teacher owned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to New Zealand’s &lt;a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/57.0/whole.html#DLM345930"&gt;1994 Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;, employers hold first ownership of copyright works produced in the course of employment. &lt;a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/Copyright-in-Schools/Guidelines-for-schools/For-teachers-and-contractors/Overview-of-copyright-issues#who"&gt;As is stated in TKI&lt;/a&gt;, the Ministry of Education’s information portal, this means that, “Unless agreed otherwise, the school will own the copyright in any teaching materials that teachers (employees) create during the course of their employment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, this means that teachers who share resources may often be infringing the school's copyright. Creative Commons policies solve this problem by enabling the school to give advance permission to all teachers to legally share and collaborate using an open Creative Commons licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Lethbridge introduced the idea of the policy after noticing that, as he put it in a &lt;a href="http://stephenlethbridge.com/?p=135"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, that “teachers were sharing more on more resources online and connecting with a great many schools who were visiting us. It would have been a nightmare to seek permission from the board, more likely the school principal, every time a teacher or student wanted to share information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Paula points out, the policy is also strongly aligned with the school’s existing vision. “Our school’s vision strongly encourages collaboration, and we encourage sharing, so it was a bit of a shock to learn that we needed to have a policy for teachers to share legally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Creative Commons policy was very aligned with our thinking as a board. There was no dissonance in our discussion. The main issue was that everyone was surprised to discover that this isn’t normal practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Paula, the CC policy passed because it supported the fundamental mission of the school -- improving student outcomes. “We knew from the documentation Stephen provided, and from other background reading, that professional development is actually one of the best ways to lift student outcomes. And a big part of professional development is sharing best practice, including resources”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula also points out the importance of BoTs aligning their school with existing government policy. While the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/nzgoal" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework&lt;/a&gt; encourages schools to use CC to release copyright works, relatively few schools are aware that the policy exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of policy and procedural issues confronting schools, it’s also unlikely that BoTs will seek out additional policy changes that aren’t brought to their attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important that Boards don’t just view this as a legal obligation and stop there. It does encompass a lot more than that, and it’s important that Boards are aware of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Stephen points out, “With the &lt;a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/portal/"&gt;Network for Learning Portal&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner school leaders need to revisit their intellectual property documentation. Creative Commons in Schools isn’t about abdicating responsibility and a copy anything approach. It is about acknowledgement, respect and attribution where the license is determined by the creators of amazing information, resources and ideas within our schools.”&lt;/p&gt;

New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. No known copyright restrictions. (O.009829)In November last year, a team of academics, librarians and students got together to hack a media studies textbook – in a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textbook was &lt;a href="http://mediatexthack.wordpress.com/about/"&gt;published online earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as an open textbook under a Creative Commons Attribution licence, and is available at no cost for educators and students to use. The licence also enables anyone to share, adapt and rewrite the textbook, as long as credit is given to the original creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving this over a weekend was obviously an extraordinarily ambitious project – and like any extraordinarily ambitious project, it didn’t always go according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, the project team, led by Erika Pearson, Bernard Madill, Richard White and Simon Hart at the University of Otago, decided from the beginning to assiduously document the process of hacking the textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team have now published the Cookbook, a “discussion on the process, pitfalls and successes of hacking an open textbook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cookbook walks readers through the texthack process, and outlines some of the issues that the team faced, including finding local open materials to embed and locating appropriate infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these difficulties, the Cookbook’s authors conclude that the “curation of this text, and the hack process that drove it, was deeply worthwhile and a highly valuable experience that led to a useful and important output for both those who wrote it and the students and classes that continue to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cookbook itself has the potential to help open textbook projects around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White says “this cookbook will hopefully guide and inspire others to produce their own open educational resources. Just like the textbook we’ve released the cookbook under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. This means that others can add to and improve the recipe using their own experiences with text hacks, without having to ask our permission in advance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sees the project as a return to the “core principles of academia: sharing knowledge, learning from and building on the work of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As White points out, “From my perspective, as a project organiser rather than someone working in the academic discipline, the cookbook represents the most important aspect of the whole project.  While others will be working in different contexts, hopefully everyone who reads the cookbook will find valuable lessons about what worked and what didn’t for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White adds that the team have “already had interest from others who are thinking about what they could do in their own areas, both inside our own university and other national groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site itself has received thousands of hits from dozens of countries, and feedback had been received requesting the adoption of sections in both secondary and tertiary programs.&lt;/p&gt;

The events featured lightning talks from a handful of experts in government, law and education, who outlined the legal, technical and cultural reasons for schools to implement a Creative Commons policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we couldn't manage to record video of the events, we have recorded the audio for the final event in Wellington. Unfortunately, Carolyn Stuart and Mark Osborne weren't able to attend, though Ian Munro was able to speak to Carolyn's slides, and we've included a quick summary of their talks below.&lt;/p&gt;

CCANZ works to achieve these goals in two ways. First, it offers free licences. Second, it runs eight different projects, which advocate for licence use is various areas, such as research, data, government and heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt then ran through eight different points, which are detailed in the slides. The general point of his talk was that while the internet and digital technologies have made sharing and reuse very easy, copyright law still represents a significant legal barrier. This is particularly true in the case of teaching resources, which remain the property of the Board of Trustees. He finished his talk by suggesting that Creative Commons licensing -- and a Creative Commons policy -- can help to address these IP problems in New Zealand schools, while actively encouraging sharing and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[/toggle]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=32786678&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[toggle title_open="Andrew Matangi, Consultant, Buddle Findlay, Member, CCANZ Legal Team" title_closed="Andrew Matangi, Consultant, Buddle Findlay, Member, CCANZ Legal Team" hide="yes" border="yes" style="default" excerpt_length="0" read_more_text="Read More" read_less_text="Read Less" include_excerpt_html="no"]Andrew began by pointing out that everyone produces and owns copyright works. The pictures on your phone, the emails to your mother, the embarrassing poems you wrote when you were in year 12 – all of these works qualify for copyright protection. Ordinarily, you, as creator, own the copyright to those works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you create the work in the course of your employment, then the copyright belongs to your employer. This means that the copyright to all teaching resources produced by teachers in the course of their employment as teachers is owned by the Board of Trustees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the BoT wanted to share teaching resources with other schools? It could say, 'here, use it.' From a lawyer’s perspective, though, this is imprecise. There might be a bunch of other things the board hasn't thought about, such as commercial reuse, attribution and liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's better, then, to use a standardised, legally robust licence, such as those provided by Creative Commons. It's more flexible, and provides protection for both you and the user. Andrew then ran through the Creative Commons licences, noting that the New Zealand licences were relatively clear and plain English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew ended his presentation by outlining New Zealand's limited 'fair dealing' exceptions. These exceptions do not offer hard and fast rules. Instead, the definition of 'fair' depends on the facts of an individual case, including the amount that is used, its impact on the market of a work, and the nature of the use in question.&lt;/p&gt;

As she pointed out, the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework supports the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector. NZGOAL provides a 'review and release process' that enables agencies to decide whether a work is suitable for release under an open licence. In the education sector, the Ministry of Education must use NZGOAL to release its copyright materials; schools and universities are encouraged to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why would they? Keitha argued that a Creative Commons policy is a way for BoTs to require teachers to use and create licensed materials. It's also a way to encourage students to use and create legally licensed materials. More broadly, the adoption of Creative Commons policies will make the education system in New Zealand more efficient and innovative, as teachers spend less time reinventing the wheel and more time sharing, collaborating and building on each other's work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools can do this by passing an open data policy – otherwise known as a Creative Commons IP policy – encouraging teachers to collaborate and share, rather than compete and duplicate efforts. This policy requires teachers to apply a Creative Commons Attribution licence when sharing resources, and use a 'no known copyright' statement if releasing a work has fallen out of copyright. Keitha finished her presentation by pointing to an open licence used by Te Ara – The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand. She also pointed to the vast amount of works available through Flickr and many other repositories searchable through CC search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[toggle title_open="Ian Munro, Ministry of Education" title_closed="Ian Munro, Ministry of Education" hide="yes" border="yes" style="default" excerpt_length="0" read_more_text="Read More" read_less_text="Read Less" include_excerpt_html="no"]Ian Munro began his presentation by pointing out that there is a wide range of attitudes to sharing resources across the teaching profession. On the one hand, some teachers are protective of their resources, or lack confidence in their quality; on the other hand, many teachers are more than happy to share resources with anyone who asks. As new technologies and pedagogies arise, Ian argued that more and more teachers will become interested in sharing and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When teachers begin to share resources, however, they have to confront the fact that, under the Copyright Act, their resources are owned by their Board of Trustees. This presents a significant hurdle to the sharing of digital resources, one that is most effectively addressed by adopting a Creative Commons IP policy at every school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ian explained, IP was one of the issues faced by the MoE as it looked to source teaching resources for schools after the February 2011 Canterbury earthquake. Many schools found themselves unable to access their resources, which were either destroyed or stuck in unsafe buildings. In response, the MoE asked many of New Zealand's top performing schools to provide subject area resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not as easy as it sounds. Some schools, for instance, were keen to ensure that the resources wouldn't be made to other schools. Other schools thought that it was a great opportunity to develop a online repository for teaching resources, and were more than happy to oblige. But even schools that were happy to oblige found that their files had no clear metadata attached, including no standardised naming schema, file organisation or file formats. This made it incredibly difficult for outsiders to find the resources they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

The portal is also a great reason for schools to adopt a Creative Commons policy, as it is going to make it much easier to find and share resources. Pond will act as a safe online environment for educators to share and collaborate, but it will require schools to clarify their positions on Intellectual Property, as it will be both the teacher's responsibility to ensure that they have permission to legally share content. Note: Carolyn was unable to share her slides, but you can read more about the N4L portal -- recently dubbed Pond -- &lt;a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/pond/" target="_blank"&gt;at their homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[toggle title_open="Stephen Lethbridge, Principal at Taupaki School" title_closed="Stephen Lethbridge, Principal at Taupaki School" hide="yes" border="yes" style="default" excerpt_length="0" read_more_text="Read More" read_less_text="Read Less" include_excerpt_html="no"]Stephen began with a quick anecdote from his days as a beginning teacher at a private school, where he had developed a planning template. A colleague asked to borrow the resource, and Stephen, in the spirit of collegiality, said yes, at which point the colleague proceeded to sell the resource to a publishing company. Stephen, hoping for royalties, complained to the principal, who pointed out that it was the school that owned the rights to the resource – and that it was the school that would be collect any royalty payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are, Stephen said, is an age of connectivity, and we are sharing more than ever. And teachers share as much as anyone, remixing and reusing resources to fit the needs of individual classrooms. New Zealand has also emerged beyond the competitive, contestable funding approach; with the recent development of Learning and Change Networks and collaboration on ICT, schools are increasingly being expected to share best practice with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important, then, that Boards of Trustees acknowledge that this is an age of sharing and collaboration – even when the professional instincts of BoT members, who may come from corporate backgrounds, are to commercialise educational resources produced at the school. This drive towards sharing and collaboration needs to be based in the vision of the school. At Taupaki, this vision was developed by the teachers and local community – without input from Stephen himself. This vision was included a desire to encourage collaboration , and this was a core part of Stephen’s sales pitch to the BoT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen submitted a discussion document to the BoT, and drew on these parts of their vision, as well as the potential for sharing in the Network for Learning, and it was passed just before Stephen went on study leave. But the implementation will be the challenge, and it is still early days. As Stephen said, quoting Friere, “ideas that are acquired with ease are discarded with ease.”&lt;/p&gt;

A policy that enabled and encouraged sharing and collaboration was a great fit with the vision of the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting David Wiley, Mark argued that sharing and collaboration is fundamental to education: "without sharing, there is no education." However, Mark also pointed out that openness is a new concept for many, including members of the Board of Trustees who may come from a commercial background. This meant that the policy required a shift in mental models. Instead of the 'see-saw' metaphor -- whereby a gain for one is a loss for the other -- Mark advocated a shift to a 'rising tide' metaphor, whereby sharing and collaboration benefits everyone, including those doing the sharing and collaborating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then pointed out several concrete examples of sharing communities, including the VLN and Wikieducator, where ASHS has had an active presence for many years. Mark concluded by discussing into other forms of openness, such as open software and open hardware, arguing that schools should be wary of locking their students into closed applications run by off-shore multi-nationals. Instead, schools should explore the range of free and open alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been running &lt;a title="Creative Commons Workshops" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schools"&gt;free ‘CC in Schools’ workshops&lt;/a&gt; across the country. Later in the week, we’ll post slides, audio and summaries of each of the speakers, as well as the issues raised in the lively Q&amp;amp;As that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With support from &lt;a href="https://internetnz.net.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;InternetNZ&lt;/a&gt;, these workshops talked about how a growing number of New Zealand schools are using CC licensing to share their teaching resources. Resource sharing, of course, isn’t new: everyday, teachers share countless resources across a range of vibrant professional networks, from the &lt;a href="http://www.vln.school.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;VLN&lt;/a&gt; to subject-area email lists. For the most part, though, resource sharing among teachers is necessarily informal. It often takes place in the form of email attachments, without licensing or metadata attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that other teachers, who may be new to the profession -- or who may simply not be part of that specific conversation or network – tend to miss out. They may, as a result, end up having to reinvent that resource later on, which gives them less time for the many, many other things teachers have do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice, then, if New Zealand had a central, searchable repository of properly labelled and openly licensed teacher-made resources. (If you’re not sure we need such a repository, check out the site visits at&lt;a href="http://maths.nayland.school.nz/" target="_blank"&gt; Nayland College's excellent Maths portal&lt;/a&gt; (soon to be CC-licensed!) – it’s had over &lt;i&gt;1.28 million&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the &lt;a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/portal/" target="_blank"&gt;Network for Learning portal&lt;/a&gt; looks set to help meet this demand. While the portal is still in beta, it has the capacity to allow teachers to find and reuse free and open resources from the entire New Zealand teaching community. This would mean that teachers, including those new to teaching, could spend less time reinventing the wheel, and more time adapting quality resources for their individual classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. But the barriers to sharing resources are not only technical – they’re legal. Under &lt;a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345930.html" target="_blank"&gt;section 21 of the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994&lt;/a&gt;, where an employee makes copyright works “in the course of his or her employment [...] that person's employer is the first owner of any copyright in the work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do? The so&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SRR-Legally.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-5229 alignleft" alt="SRR Legally" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SRR-Legally.png" width="249" height="255"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;lution for many New Zealand schools is a &lt;a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons IP policy&lt;/a&gt;, approved by a school’s BoT. This policy gives teachers permission in advance to share resources under an open Creative Commons licence. This means that teachers can legally make the most of online resource sharing portals, such as the Network for Learning (or &lt;a href="http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page" target="_blank"&gt;Wikieducator&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such policies are also supported by the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework&lt;/a&gt;, approved by Cabinet in 2010. This framework instructs core agencies – like the Ministry of Education – to consider using Creative Commons licences when releasing copyright works. Happily, NZGOAL also encourages Boards of Trustees to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why use a CC licence? Simply put, an open licence gives others teachers clarity about what they can do with your work and how you wish to be credited. As Andrew Matangi – who had a big hand in writing the CC licences -- pointed out in the workshops, the licences are also legally robust, which means that you don’t need to worry about issues like liability. (Andrew’s example was a malfunctioning science experiment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the more open CC licenses also allow the creation of ‘derivative’ works – that is to say, these licences let you adapt and improve the works. As every teacher knows, this is crucial, as even the best resources need to be tweaked or remixed for the unique challenges of individual classrooms. Simply put, digital technologies make remix easy; CC licences make remix legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds quite legalistic, but the primary effects of a CC policy – as Stephen Lethbridge and Mark Osborne both pointed out – are &lt;i&gt;cultural&lt;/i&gt;. Stephen and Mark’s CC policies were passed to support their schools’ desire to be collaborative, open and networked places, where teachers and students share, make and innovate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Education</category><category>Events</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/03/18/sharing-collaboration-and-copyright.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2014 23:52:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Media Release: New Zealand Schools Join the Commons</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/03/06/media-release-new-zealand-schools-join-the-commons.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week, a range of teachers, principals, government officials and copyright experts are getting together to discuss how New Zealand teachers can legally share and reuse teaching resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speakers include Andrew Matangi from Buddle Findlay, Stephen Lethbridge, principal of Taupaki School and Carolyn Stuart, Education Sector Lead for the Network for Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking place in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, the events follow the rapid uptake of Creative Commons licensing policies by New Zealand schools. These policies make it legal for teachers to share their resources without asking advance permission from the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Matt McGregor, Public Lead of Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ, points out, more than forty New Zealand schools have now adopted Creative Commons policies, up from four in March 2013. These schools include Tawa Intermediate, Albany Senior High School and Taupaki School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand has over 50,000 teachers working in over 2,500 schools,” says McGregor. “If teachers were encouraged to legally share and collaborate – rather than reinvent the wheel – the savings of time and money across the education sector are potentially enormous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Lethbridge, Principal of Taupaki School, points out that it’s in the nature of teachers to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taupaki School passed its Creative Commons policy after noticing that, as &lt;a href="http://stephenlethbridge.com/?p=135" target="_blank"&gt;Lethbridge puts it&lt;/a&gt;, “teachers were sharing more on more resources online and connecting with a great many schools who were visiting us. It would have been a nightmare to seek permission from the board, more likely the school principal, every time a teacher or student wanted to share information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Osborne, former Deputy Principal of Albany Senior High School, &lt;a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/" target="_blank"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that the use of Creative Commons has had broader cultural effects at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he said in 2012, “The big change taking place is that teachers are collaborating more, and they’re also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources. This is quite different from what happens in most schools.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons policies have been supported by the New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework, or NZGOAL, approved by Cabinet in 2010. This framework outlines massive cultural, economic and educational benefits of sharing publicly funded copyright materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without sharing, there is no education”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– David Wiley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As anyone who works in education knows, all teachers share and collaborate. From swapping lesson plans to re&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CC-brochure.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4925" alt="CC brochure" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CC-brochure-300x274.png" width="300" height="274"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;using  assignments, teachers are constantly looking to make better resources by building on each other’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this is getting easier. With the Internet and digital technologies, there is a much wider pool of teachers to collaborate with— and, in turn, a much richer range of reusable digital resources. With over 2,500 schools and 53,000 teachers working in New Zealand state funded schools, the potential is enormous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Copyright&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, the copyright in resources made by most kiwi teachers in the course of their employment is held by their respective Boards of Trustees (their employers.) Legally, this means that teachers have to ask permission from their Board of Trustees before they can share their resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more teaching and learning is done online, it’s essential that teachers have permission to legally share and collaborate. This is why Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, following the lead of NZGOAL, is recommending that each Board of Trustees adopt a Creative Commons policy giving all school teachers advance permission to legally share their resources for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;NZGOAL&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approved by Cabinet in July 2010, NZGOAL (the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework) advocates the use of Creative Commons licences for copyright works released by State Services agencies, including New Zealand schools.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons is an international non-profit, with projects in over seventy countries. Creative Commons provides free, legally robust licences that allow copyright owners to give permission for their work to be shared and reused. A Creative Commons licence tells other people what they can do with your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons licences are being used everywhere—from the White House and Wikipedia to the New Zealand Government—to enable content and data to be shared and reused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Creative Commons Policy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Creative Commons policy approved by your Board of Trustees will enable teachers at your school to share their teaching resources under a Creative Commons licence. A Creative Commons policy will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Encourage teachers at your school to legally share and collaborate online;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Ensure that when teachers leave, both the teacher and the school retain access to all teaching resources;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Enable NZ teachers to spend more time adapting high quality resources, and less time reinventing the wheel.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Teachers are collaborating more, and they’re also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources.” – Mark Osborne,  Albany Senior High School&lt;/p&gt;
