&lt;p&gt;te tuakiri tangata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tīhei uriuri, tīhei nakonako.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons has published the translation of the Creative Commons 4.0 copyright licences into te reo Māori. This is the first translation of the Creative Commons licences into an indigenous language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons licences are free legal tools that anyone can use to share their copyright works more openly. The licences allow rights holders to release their work into the commons under a range of freedoms and restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karaitiana Taiuru is a digital indigenous philosopher and governance practitioner, and a leading figure in the online Māori renaissance of the internet. He says: “This is an important step for te reo Māori resources being able to utilise the power and flexibility of Creative Commons, whereas before the rights notice and licence details would have had to have been in a different language from that of the resource.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Cormack, member of the Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand Advisory Panel and one of the original developers of the Koha Open Source Library management systems, says: “The more languages the Creative Commons licences are in, the more accessible they are. It's especially important in Aotearoa that it is available in te reo Māori, our first language.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The translation was completed by Ian Cormack, Director of Taumatua Māori Language Services and a licensed Māori Translator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Cormack, the translation provided several interesting challenges. ‘Sui Generis Database Rights’, for example, was translated as Motika Pātengi Raraunga Momo Takitahi -- with Motika translated as ‘rights’, Pātengi Raraunga as ‘database’ and Momo Takitahi as ‘single kind/genus.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other terms, like ‘Copyright and Similar Rights’, were translated as Manatārua me ngā Motika Rite, with Manatārua the legal term for copyright, and Rite translated as ‘similar, like.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The translated licences will promote taonga and matauranga to be created, shared and published with the legal protection of the Creative Commons licences while recognising iwi, hapū and whānau, as well as whakapapa of the material,” says Taiuru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons licences in Aotearoa New Zealand are increasingly being used by teachers, librarians, artists, musicians, researchers and government departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Currently, millions of collection items are locked away because digital reproductions are made available under terms of use that are either vague or unnecessarily restrictive,” says Matt McGregor from Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Creative Commons copyright licensing and clear out-of-copyright statements can help solve this problem. By providing clarity for staff and the public, policies focussing on Open Access and reuse can strengthen an institution’s capacity to meet its other obligations, including to respect indigenous knowledge and third-party intellectual property restrictions,” says McGregor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the adoption of a simple and pragmatic open policy, the heritage sector can expand its audience, provide better services, save resources over the long term and be well positioned for future technological changes -- while still maintaining its traditional role as kaitiaki of Aotearoa’s heritage and taonga.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand believes that works hosted by heritage organisations should be open by default, unless there is a good reason to restrict access, such as copyright or indigenous knowledge restrictions. More specifically, we support these institutions adopting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Clear open licensing for in-copyright works, where possible.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Clear ‘no known copyright’ or Public Domain Marks for out-of-copyright works.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Open licensing options for those who donate or deposit works with GLAM organisations.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the National Digital Forum Conference 2014, we celebrate the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, both of whom are leading the way. The National Library &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/nlnz-reuse-policy/"&gt;has recently published a new, more open use and reuse policy&lt;/a&gt; for its collection items; and Te Papa has now &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/te-papas-openly-licensed-images/"&gt;made nearly forty thousand images freely downloadable&lt;/a&gt; from its &lt;a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/"&gt;Collections Online&lt;/a&gt; digital database, giving the public access to the highest-resolution images it can and opening the way for creative reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is now calling for other Kiwi heritage institutions to follow suit, and give Kiwis Open Access to our invaluable taonga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Media Release</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/11/18/kiwis-need-better-access-to-our-nations-taonga.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2014 01:22:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Kiwis need Open Access to publicly funded research</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/10/16/kiwis-need-open-access-to-publicly-funded-research.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ is calling for all New Zealanders to have &lt;a title="Open Access to Research" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/research/"&gt;Open Access to publicly funded research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt McGregor of Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ says: “From the point of view of the general public, the current system of scholarly publishing is broken. Taxpayers can end up paying for published research three times over: funding the research; employing the researcher; and buying access for a limited number of students and researchers to read the final publication. The public, despite this investment, generally receives no access whatsoever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that the social, cultural and economic benefits of taxpayer-funded research -- including new research, innovative products, better public policy and a well-informed citizenry -- are not fully realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hundreds of universities and research funders around the world have adopted Open Access policies. It’s great to see universities like Lincoln, Canterbury and Waikato leading the way in New Zealand on this front,” says McGregor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It would be of enormous benefit to New Zealand for the rest of the research sector to follow in their footsteps, and adopt Open Access mandates. This will enable everyone -- including teachers, students, journalists and businesses -- to have access to the research that we all pay for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabiana Kubke, neuroscientist, Senior Lecturer at the University of Auckland and Chair of the Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ Advisory Panel, says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We put a man on the moon about half a century ago yet we still haven’t solved the problem of access to research. The more broadly we disseminate our findings, the more likely we are to achieve the goals set out by the NZ Education Act: to maintain, advance, and assist in the application of knowledge, to develop intellectual independence, and to promote community learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These goals can be best met by making the research outputs available under Open Access and, equally importantly, allowing re-use. &lt;a title="Licences" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences-2/"&gt;Creative Commons licences&lt;/a&gt; enable this to happen."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiwi academics are starting to embrace the possibilities inherent in Open Access, but their efforts will need to be supported by mandates from research organisations and funding bodies. Chris Whelan, Executive Director of &lt;a href="http://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/"&gt;Universities NZ&lt;/a&gt;, says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We support Open Access policies across the tertiary sector. At present, published research is hugely expensive for public universities to access, and is largely inaccessible to the wider public. These costs have risen enormously over the last two decades, and we have not seen a reciprocal increase in benefits to either the university sector or the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The existing paywalls to scholarship slow down the pace of discovery and prevent the benefits of university scholarship from being fully realised. Given the substantial public investment in research, Open Access policies should be adopted across the research sector, to ensure that New Zealanders have access to the research they fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This will put New Zealand in line with universities and research funders overseas, and enable universities to more effectively share the fruits of their research.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a title="Open Access Week 2014" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/10/oaweek2014/"&gt;Open Access Week 2014&lt;/a&gt; (20-26 October), we celebrate the three NZ universities -- Lincoln, Canterbury and Waikato -- that have Open Access policies. Aotearoa also has a world-leading Open Access and licensing mandate for public sector data and information, dubbed &lt;a title="Open Government" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/government/"&gt;NZGOAL&lt;/a&gt;, which was approved by Cabinet in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ is calling for all publicly funded research in New Zealand to be Open Access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Media Release</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/10/16/kiwis-need-open-access-to-publicly-funded-research.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 03:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Open Textbook Cookbook</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/06/03/the-open-textbook-cookbook.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Herbert Green, 1919. New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. No known copyright restrictions. (O.009829)In November last year, a team of academics, librarians and students got together to hack a media studies textbook – in a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The textbook was &lt;a href="http://mediatexthack.wordpress.com/about/"&gt;published online earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as an open textbook under a Creative Commons Attribution licence, and is available at no cost for educators and students to use. The licence also enables anyone to share, adapt and rewrite the textbook, as long as credit is given to the original creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving this over a weekend was obviously an extraordinarily ambitious project – and like any extraordinarily ambitious project, it didn’t always go according to plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, the project team, led by Erika Pearson, Bernard Madill, Richard White and Simon Hart at the University of Otago, decided from the beginning to assiduously document the process of hacking the textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team have now published the Cookbook, a “discussion on the process, pitfalls and successes of hacking an open textbook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cookbook walks readers through the texthack process, and outlines some of the issues that the team faced, including finding local open materials to embed and locating appropriate infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these difficulties, the Cookbook’s authors conclude that the “curation of this text, and the hack process that drove it, was deeply worthwhile and a highly valuable experience that led to a useful and important output for both those who wrote it and the students and classes that continue to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cookbook itself has the potential to help open textbook projects around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White says “this cookbook will hopefully guide and inspire others to produce their own open educational resources. Just like the textbook we’ve released the cookbook under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. This means that others can add to and improve the recipe using their own experiences with text hacks, without having to ask our permission in advance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sees the project as a return to the “core principles of academia: sharing knowledge, learning from and building on the work of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As White points out, “From my perspective, as a project organiser rather than someone working in the academic discipline, the cookbook represents the most important aspect of the whole project.  While others will be working in different contexts, hopefully everyone who reads the cookbook will find valuable lessons about what worked and what didn’t for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White adds that the team have “already had interest from others who are thinking about what they could do in their own areas, both inside our own university and other national groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site itself has received thousands of hits from dozens of countries, and feedback had been received requesting the adoption of sections in both secondary and tertiary programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cookbook is available online &lt;a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/texthack/2014/05/15/the-cookbook/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a short introduction to the process of hacking an open textbook, Erika has kindly provided her hugely popular &lt;a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/texthack/2014/05/15/a-recap-of-a-texthack-in-gifs-because-why-not/"&gt;GIF-heavy recap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Education</category><category>Media Release</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/06/03/the-open-textbook-cookbook.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 04:05:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Media Release: Open Textbook Project</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/11/20/media-release-open-textbook-project.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;This is the media release for the Media Text Hack, completed on the weekend of 16-17 November. The project was covered by the &lt;a href="http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/281800/textbook-project-internet"&gt;ODT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://techday.com/educate/news/academics-to-hack-an-open-textbook/173459/"&gt;Techday&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.idealog.co.nz/blog/2013/11/need-better-textbook-hack-it-yourself"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Idealog&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the weekend of 16-17 November, a group of academics across Australia and New Zealand are getting together at their respective campuses to collaboratively write – or ‘hack’ – &lt;a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/texthack/about-the-project/" target="_blank"&gt;an open textbook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr Erika Pearson, Richard White and Simon Hart at the University of Otago – with assistance from Bernard Madill – the open textbook project will be an experiment in the production of open educational resources in Aotearoa New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This textbook will be for undergraduate students in Communication and Media Studies around Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With contributions from academics across New Zealand and Australia, the textbook will be free of all technical and legal restrictions on access and reuse. This means that it will free for by anyone in the world to read, distribute and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr Pearson, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Media, Film and Communication, says, “Textbooks currently available for New Zealand first year students are often produced overseas, usually the US, and can have a cripplingly high price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Open texts are not only more affordable for students, they also are more flexible for teachers, who can pull apart open textbooks to find the more relevant and useful materials for their classes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Otago Copyright Officer Richard White agrees. “I often get questions from staff about using various types of materials for teaching purposes.  Often with closed resources, restricted by all-rights-reserved copyright, staff get frustrated that they can’t provide a good resource to students in the way they want because of cost or difficulty in contacting – or event identifying – the rights holder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White sees the open textbook projects as a return to the “core principles of academia: sharing knowledge, learning from and building on the work of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open textbook will use a Creative Commons Attribution licence, enabling anyone to share, adapt and rewrite the textbook, as long as credit is given to the original creators. Creative Commons International is partially funding the project, through a grant to Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White says that Creative Commons licensing “is the perfect vehicle. It ensures our rights as creators are preserved while at the same time enabling others to share our work as widely as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Open textbooks, using Creative Commons licensing, are flexible. They don't force you to fit other people's pedagogy,” says Dr Pearson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was inspired by a group of Finnish mathematicians who successfully wrote &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34643" target="_blank"&gt;an open mathematics textbook in a weekend.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team hopes that their project will inspire other open textbooks in the region. As Dr Pearson puts it, “This is why we are producing in parallel a 'cookbook,' to give detailed tips and advice for anyone who wants to attempt a similar project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For White, the project will “allow students in our region to access a work in their own cultural paradigm and for others to build on it.  And we think that recording the process and telling people what worked and what didn’t is just as important as the text itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a new way to produce work like this and we’ll all be learning a lot as we go.  It’s a real challenge but really exciting at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Education</category><category>Media Release</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/11/20/media-release-open-textbook-project.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Nov 2013 22:06:11 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
