&lt;p&gt;Copyright is one of the more flexible forms of intellectual property. It can be used to protect almost any form of expression, whether literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, industrial, sound recording, film, communication work, or typographical arrangement.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from what point does an original copyright work exist? For example, the creation of a single word does not attract copyright protection. That single word does not hold enough creative effort or “originality” to be considered an original literary work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, copying someone else’s existing work, even if showing that work in a new way, is not likely to give rise to an original work.2 A work cannot be original if it is a copy of, or an infringement of, an existing work.3 It must be independently created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an original work may be created by expending sufficient skill, judgement or labour, even if that work incorporates publicly available information. This may occur, for example, where a person creates a new compilation of available information, such a new recipe or a new directory. In these examples, which require the author’s skill, judgement or labour, the level of creativity or ingenuity required for “originality” may be relatively low.4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if a work is not particularly creative, then how much skill, judgement or labour is required before it becomes an “original” copyright work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Case Study: The Dead Sea Scrolls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls are ancient religious manuscripts dating back to 200 BC. Part of the Scrolls is the Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah (“MMT”), a particularly sought after Hebrew document that has only been discovered in fragments.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1954, professors Elisha Qimron and John Strugnell identified, transcribed, and reconstructed countless fragments from six different manuscripts containing the MMT. The professors arranged the manuscript fragments in a way they believed would most accurately represent the original MMT text. That process took 11 years and, even then, more than half the MMT was missing. The professors then filled in, or interpolated, the gaps based on their extensive knowledge and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting ‘Qimron’ version of MMT was finally officially published in 1994. However in 1992 (before the official publication), a member of the Biblical Archaeology Society published a large part of the Qimron MMT, without the professor’s permission. He did this in order to make the MMT available to other scholars, fearing that access to it would otherwise be heavily restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qimron sued the Biblical Archaeology Society for copyright infringement, saying that his version of the MMT was unique, and an original copyright work. (Keep in mind that, at the same time, the professors claimed to have formed the most accurate complete version of the original MMT.) So, could the professors claim copyright in the fruits of their labour as “original” literary works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli Supreme Court held that, yes, the work was an original literary work that attracted copyright protection. The professors’ work on the MMT was not purely technical or mechanical labour yielding a predetermined or known result. Instead, the “additional soul” that the professors inspired in the fragments of the Scrolls, with their labour, made them the owners of the copyright in the Qimron MMT text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Factual Enquiry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Qimron case is a particularly fact-specific one, but so are most copyright cases. All of the facts must be considered, including:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The “starting point” of the work;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The whole of the completed work;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The extent of the copying and alteration (whether a substantial part of the original work survived, so as to appear to be a copy of the original work);&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The quality of the work, rather than the quantity of what has been taken;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Whether mere literal or mechanical copying has taken place;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Whether advantage has been taken of the original work.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After performing this enquiry, one should be left with a reasonable overall impression of whether the new work is in fact an “original” work, regardless of whether it was formed from a spark of creativity, or from the author’s blood, sweat, and tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do George Bush, Bob Dylan, and Shepard Fairey have in common? It sounds like the start to a bad joke, but potential copyright infringement is no laughing matter – particularly when trying to make a name for oneself as an original artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three cautionary tales…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;“Hope”&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, street artist Shepard Fairey created an iconic image for Obama’s presidential election campaign. Fairey was already known for his use of repetition in street art (notably his “OBEY” poster featuring wrestler Andre the Giant), but this was taken to the next level with his blue and red image of Obama above the word “HOPE”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image went viral online and by October 2008, Fairey claimed to have printed the image on 300,000 physical posters, 1 million stickers, clothing and other items, not to mention the number of downloads of a free printable digital version. Fairey reportedly cited his inspiration as being a contemporary take on a well-known JFK portrait, or the image of President Lincoln on the five dollar note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama won the election, and Fairey became an internet sensation. But Fairey’s story became even more sensational in 2009 when he was accused of basing his image on an Associated Press photograph taken by Mannie Garcia in 2006. Associated Press sued for copyright infringement, while Fairey sought a declaration that his use of the photograph was protected by the doctrine of “fair use”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2009 and in the light of damning discovery documents, Fairey admitted that he had based his poster on the Associated Press photograph, and that he fabricated and destroyed evidence to hide that fact. With a finding of infringement likely, Fairey and Associated Press reached a confidential out of court settlement agreement in January 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairey was later charged in a criminal suit with destruction of evidence and sentenced to 300 hours of community service and a US$25,000 fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt; “Drawn Blank”&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2011, Bob Dylan exhibited the first of a series of paintings entitled “Drawn Blank”. The exhibition’s description was a “visual journal of travels in Japan, China, Vietnam, and Korea” with “first-hand depictions of people, street scenes, architecture and landscape”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within days, internet chatter revealed what appeared to be the true source of Dylan’s paintings. One painting, called “Opium”, was almost identical to a photo by Léon Busy (1915). Another, entitled “Trade”, is a replica of a photo by Henri Cartier-Bresson (1948). These are just two examples of several alleged copies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Dylan had ‘drawn a creative blank’ himself, and the exhibition title should have tipped us off. However, there have been no further repercussions for Dylan’s apparent copying, except perhaps a public loss of respect for his works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;“Art of Leadership”&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now mid-2014, and the gist of this article should signpost the irony of George Bush’s exhibition title. Instead of taking a lesson from the above case studies or leading by example, Bush also found himself the centre of controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bush gave detailed explanations of how he chose to paint each of the political figureheads shown in his exhibition. He explained having painted his father George H.W. Bush with a “gesture of compassion”, and Angela Merkel as being a “sympathetic portrait”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But critics have now identified that many of Bush’s images are uncannily similar to the very first result of a Google images search. Here’s a visual example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be little excuse for Bush, who once had access to all of the leaders in his exhibition, and certainly could have obtained an original photograph (or live sitting) of his own father. While being caught out must have caused some embarrassment, no further action has been taken against Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Take home messages&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Do not copy existing copyright works or substantial parts of those works. Google search results and online images are not always “free” images in that they might well (and often do) attract copyright protection.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Create an original work, using inspiration where necessary. If you are drawing on some form of inspiration, carefully check and acknowledge your sources where required.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;If you want to use a copyright work outright, ask the owner for permission. Without the owner’s permission, direct copying of a work is likely to amount to copyright infringement.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;If you want to share your work, but think it’s difficult, talk to someone about using a Creative Commons license. They’re easy to understand, simple to apply, and provide clarity for all involved.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Lastly, be honest about your inspiration. If you are using someone else’s image – even if only as ‘inspiration’ – chances are that you will be found out!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
