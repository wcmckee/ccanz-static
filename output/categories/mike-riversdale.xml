&lt;p&gt;Every family has its story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we commemorate &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/"&gt;100 years of the beginning of World War 1&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of us are tracking down our grandparents stories, how the soldiers within in our families fought and died, how those back at home coped with the hardships and the many years of repercussions as the scars, both external and internal, came home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with these &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/life-100-years-ago"&gt;‘big event’ stories&lt;/a&gt;, we all have a myriad of everyday tales that we commonly think of as particular to ourselves, memories of days gone past and yarns to be recounted at family get-togethers. And of course we all have our recent stories: last year’s summer holiday, the kid’s birthday celebration and even that catch up with mates in the pub last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these stories go to make up the fabric of our families, our friendships and our whanau - without them we are indeed islands and, as we all know, “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man_Is_an_Island_(disambiguation)"&gt;No man is an island&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does Creative Commons licences have to do with this collection of stories spanning the generations in your family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of verbal histories (or in some cases myths and even our own family urban legends) we gain insight into our earliest stories from the &lt;a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Topic/7425"&gt;writings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Object/1436499"&gt;photographs&lt;/a&gt; and, if we’re lucky, film left behind by our ancestors. As time passes on, these artefacts enter the “&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/pdm"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt;" (also know as “no known copyright”) and come to possess, as we see in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LTCOLMalone"&gt;personal histories and stories&lt;/a&gt; being used in the World War 1 commemorations across the Internet, a sense of common / shared knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing Gran recall her childhood stories, during those fleeting times that she wants to tell us and we are old enough to listen, are special moments. But when we touch, see and hear from the artefacts of her days -- such as her father’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adkin_diary"&gt;diaries scribbled during the battles&lt;/a&gt; -- we are immediately connected in a far more visceral manner. We feel it as part of our own story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step sideways for second, we are all keenly aware, especially in times of emergency and hardship, that families that play together stay together. These communities of families are the coming together of stories shared across the whanau boundary as they build, one upon the other,  flowing across and through to make the very fabric of our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stories are shared, the artefacts (diaries, cine film, video tapes, clothes, tapes) become the ‘facts’ upon which we all stand. Locking up these artifacts with individuals and inside families could slowly diminish our sense of society, community and shared being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, letting Gran’s artefacts go to the vagaries of the ‘marketplace’ is not something many of us feel comfortable with - these are OUR stories and we want them to be treasured and loved as much as we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/"&gt;Creative Commons licences&lt;/a&gt; allows us to think into the future, to place our own wishes upon our photos, to let future generations know how we’d like our stories to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may indeed want to reserve all rights and keep the diaries away from the commercial world. Others may want the great great grandchildren to know that the re-use of the 1970’s holiday film would be welcome as long as it wasn’t for monetary gain (that’s a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/"&gt;BY-NC&lt;/a&gt; licence).  In fact, most of use will choose different approaches for different artefacts - the diary is for certain eyes and not to be shared, the photos of beaches are for all to use however they want and in whatever manner and tools people have in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons licences allows all of us, including your Gran, to make a conscious and active choice - this is how our stories can be reused. And for your great grandchildren, or even your cousins third nephew twice removed, this allows them the freedom to take those memories and incorporate them into their own stories, creating a richer a deeper society for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our house, we have a shelf of cookbooks. Some have barely been opened, others are the classic “coffee table” types, but then there’s the ones we use at every opportunity. I’m sure you’re just the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rely heavily on my British background and am never far from Mrs B (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Beeton's_Book_of_Household_Management"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) when I need to know how long to roast a chicken. Having been here in New Zealand since 1996, I will also reach for every student’s cooking bible, &lt;a href="http://www.edmondscooking.co.nz/recipe.htm"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edmonds Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these fine tomes pale into nothing when compared to my wife's recipe “book”. It is handmade, full of very old bits of paper and uses a hope and a prayer as a means of organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3105520698_f64225431d_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-294 size-full" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/3105520698_f64225431d_z.jpg" alt="Reference: 'Creamy Broccoli Soup' by Bill Mckee. Copyright: CC-BY-SA" width="640" height="480"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Reference: '&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wfb/3105520698/" target="_blank"&gt;Creamy Broccoli Soup&lt;/a&gt;' by Bill Mckee. Copyright: &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" target="_blank"&gt;CC-BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collection of recipes (to be called “Liz’s Recipe Book”, even though it’s not strictly a book) is chock full of IP -- that is, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property"&gt;Intellectual Property&lt;/a&gt;, that nebulous stuff that seems to be both the oil and the grit in today's society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what has Liz’s Recipe Book got to do with Creative Commons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything. Liz's Recipe Book is &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/"&gt;CC-BY-NC&lt;/a&gt; in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the main idea I’d like everyone to walk in to their kitchen with - Creative Commons is NOT a new, strange, librarian-focussed, computer-nerd ridden subject. It is most certainly a subject that librarians and IT folk &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to have a deep understanding of, but it also swirls around us normal people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is Creative Commons in the kitchen? It’s the right to have a copy of someone's recipe under strict instructions as how you can use it. This is an explicit right given by the originator of the recipe. It doesn’t imply ability -- just because you can follow the recipe, doesn't make you a good cook (I know). And if I use the recipe but still make a mess of it, that’s my problem, not the person who wrote the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my mother-in-law passes on her recipes to everyone and anyone she can (and you’ll be happy if it’s you). She wants the world to know that her broccoli soup is da bomb and that everyone should make it. Just like Jamie Oliver, surely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost. But imagine going into your local library, photocopying each page of &lt;em&gt;The Naked Chef&lt;/em&gt; and walking out. Imagine trying to do that in Whitcoulls. Imagine doing that by filming Jamie Oliver in his restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference? Jamie Oliver uses copyright to restrict use of his recipes to specified means - buy the book, watch the TV show, come to the live show, GO TO THE RESTAURANT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if my mother-in-law said, “Here ya go Liz, have my broccoli soup recipe, that’ll be $5 please” - yeah, right! Or, even more unlikely, “Here ya go Liz, my favourite broccoli soup recipe. Oh, every time you show it to someone can you please get them to pay $10 and I’ll take my $5 cut?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not how family recipes are passed down, is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a world where everything was owned and managed like a Jamie Oliver recipe. We’d never get my wife’s Curry Broccoli Soup dish, and that would be a very sad world indeed. That’s not to say that I’m advocating getting rid of the standard, paid-for cookbook. Far from it. But I certainly don’t want to have a system of copyright applied as a default just because there’s no other option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily there is something else: Creative Commons. Using Creative Commons, my mother-in-law can protect herself and her recipes. She can ensure her broccoli soup recipe is passed on without hindrance. She can let future generations know that she’d love it to be used as the basis of future broccoli soup dishes. She can also, if she see’s fit, ensure that no-one can make money off her recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you have a recipe you want to protect in different ways? If so, check out &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;the Creative Commons licences&lt;/a&gt; that suit you and spread those delicious recipes* around the world for all to feast upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;* recipes = food, software, music, art, photos …. you get the picture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
