&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did your Open Access philosophy develop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global political economy is one of the key barriers to human social process. Information should be free like the air we breathe and not a market commodity with a profit attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ePress we believe that knowledge should be accessible to all. Academics are paid by taxpayers to research and produce knowledge, and the idea that students and the general public must pay for that knowledge does not sit well with us. It should be available to anyone who has the desire to read and use it. Citizens have the right to learn; access to information and knowledge should not be through their wallets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did ePress come to be set up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPress is an online, quality-assured, in-house publisher for authors and researchers working at, or associated with, Unitec Institute of Technology. As well as there being research produced at Unitec that needed a publishing home, there were other outputs such as performances, mixed media, design and art installations that all had potential as non-traditional publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of ePress emerged out of a desire to harness the publishing potential of all these outputs by providing a platform from which they could be shared. Launched in late 2011, ePress started off with the more traditional conference proceedings and reports, and quickly grew to embrace eMedia and books. In 2014 ePress really hit its stride with the publication of two books (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Press, Politics and People in Papua New Guinea 1950-1975" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/press-politics-and-people-in-papua-new-guinea-1950-1975/" target="_blank"&gt;Press, Politics and People in Papua New Guinea 1950-1975&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Philip Cass and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Ngā Reanga Youth Development Māori Styles" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/nga-reanga-youth-development-maori-styles-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Ngā Reanga Youth Development Māori Styles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Josie Keelan), an edited collection (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Communication Issues in Aotearoa New Zealand" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/communication-issues-in-aotearoa-new-zealand-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Communication Issues in Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; edited by Giles Dodson and Evangelia Papoutsaki), two wonderful eMedia (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Rosebank: Cabbages, Horses and Science" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/rosebank-cabbages-horses-and-science/" target="_blank"&gt;Rosebank: Cabbages, Horses and Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Paul Woodruffe and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="The Moveable Feast Collective Teach Design" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/the-moveable-feast-collective-teach-design-2/" target="_blank"&gt;The Moveable Feast Collective Teach Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Susan Jowsey) as well publishing conference proceedings for the 31st Annual Society of Architectural Historians Australia and New Zealand (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Translation" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/translation/" target="_blank"&gt;Translation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;edited by Christoph Schnoor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2015 ePress unveiled new layouts and cover art for our regular series; launched a new series titled &lt;i&gt;Perspectives in Biosecurity Research Series&lt;/i&gt; edited by Dan Blanchon and Mel Galbraith; and announced the production of a forthcoming collection titled &lt;i&gt;Conceptual Works in Sports Studies&lt;/i&gt; and edited by Lesley Ferkins and Mieke Sieuw. It’s going to be a big year at ePress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed any changes over time in the academic perception of Open Access scholarly publishing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. The perception used to be very much one of scholarly snobbery. If you weren’t in the right journal, or published to certain standards, it was of no merit to academia. However, things are changing, and fast. The methods for producing knowledge are changing and so too should our method of dissemination. More and more scholars are accepting and embracing the idea that there are other ways to prepare, produce and disseminate information. EPress has a strong focus on eMedia publications and they are a great example of alternative ways to share that knowledge. With these methods have come new researchers, authors and producers who believe that Open Access is the way forward for them. This new way of thinking is producing some truly fun and unique publications that might not have found a home anywhere else. More traditional publishers would not have been able to control their distribution and make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has been your experience of publishing with a Creative Commons licence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When authors submit to ePress we explain our processes and the Creative Commons licensing system. We automatically assign new publications with the Attribution-NonCommercial licence and give the authors time to investigate the other licences, should they wish to change. The response to the licensing, and the one we auto-select for them, has been well received by all of our authors. For those who are new to Creative Commons, they have really embraced the goals of Open Access publishing – though they are publishing with ePress so to an extent they are probably Open Access supporters already!&lt;/p&gt;

Using her background in fashion and design, she has created &lt;a title="Anatomy teaching models" href="http://anatomy.otago.ac.nz/services-and-resources/121-patterns-for-fabric-anatomy-teaching-models" target="_blank"&gt;anatomy teaching models&lt;/a&gt; of various human body parts using fabric, metals, and other materials. She has recently released the patterns for these models under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike licence. I interviewed Fieke about how and why she came to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://anatomy.otago.ac.nz/images/Patterns_for_Fabric_Anatomy_Teaching/BurlesqueBrainSequence.mp4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Burlesque Brain. Creators: Dr Christine Jasoni (initial idea and academic support), Fieke Neuman (patterns, sewing, floam). All from Department of Anatomy, University of Otago. Licensed CC BY-NC-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did it all start?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the December 2012 combined AIAS/ANZACA (Australasian Institute of Anatomical Sciences / Australian &amp;amp; New Zealand Association of Clinical Anatomists) conference in Coogee I gave a talk about some fabric models I had made for teaching anatomy. I promised to send the patterns to people I'd talked to at the conference, once I'd sorted out copyright issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was it a surprise to you to learn that you couldn't license the copyright to your work without the University's permission?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. I'd sort of known of the University &lt;a title="Otago University IP policy" href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/administration/policies/otago003229.html" target="_blank"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; regarding intellectual property for decades, without considering that it would ever apply to me. Nowadays it is easy to check on this sort of thing as University policies can be &lt;a title="Copyright at Otago Uni" href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/administration/copyright/" target="_blank"&gt;viewed online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter" src="http://anatomy.otago.ac.nz/images/Patterns_for_Fabric_Anatomy_Teaching/developing_heart/LabelledHeart.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="486"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Developing Heart. Creators: Dr Christine Jasoni (initial idea and academic support), Fieke Neuman (patterns, sewing, floam). All from Department of Anatomy, University of Otago. Licensed CC BY-NC-SA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did you talk about this with your colleagues?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We briefly discussed the possibility of selling the patterns but decided we would get more benefit, as a Department, by sharing them. Sharing meant using Creative Commons but it also meant getting formal permission from the University to give away the standard copyright (see Otago Intellectual Property Policy, section 4a). So I got permission in 2013 from my Head of Department and he wrote to to the PVC Health Sciences who also gave formal permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What made the Anatomy Department decide to share your patterns rather than sell them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognised that it would require quite a bit of time, money and effort to set up the kind of system whereby you could make sales of such items possible -- more than could be returned by the process. I've run a fashion business in the past and know how difficult it is to make sales to cover all of the costs involved. On the other side of the coin, we strengthen our bonds to our community by being generous and not hiding away information that others could use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What made you choose that particular Creative Commons licence?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose the &lt;a title="CC BY-NC-SA" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/a&gt; licence as it allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon our work non-commercially, as long as they credit the originator and license their new creations under identical terms. It suits the spirit of the scientific and teaching community that we are a part of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did you hear about Creative Commons originally?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet browsing, National Radio, a review magazine that I subscribe to … It seems to be one of those things that's just in the air. Refreshingly different from the traditional way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are there any other resources that you or your colleagues are thinking of licensing under CC?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early days yet. I'm sure other people in our department will be inspired once they see that it can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first became aware of Creative Commons through reading about &lt;a title="Lawrence Lessig" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt; and his work. The more I read about the development of Creative Commons and the &lt;a title="Copyleft" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft" target="_blank"&gt;copyleft &lt;/a&gt;movement, the more interested I became in the CC licences as a less restrictive and more inclusive way to license my work.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JC_CC_CALENDAR_3.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-425" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JC_CC_CALENDAR_3-212x300.png" alt="Swimsuit calendar by Judith Carnaby" width="212" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Swimsuit calendar (July) - Lawrence Lessig. Judith Carnaby, CC BY-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first illustrations published under a CC licence were for Sam Muirhead's 2013 Year of Open Source &lt;a title="Year of Open Source swimsuit calendar" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/YEAR-OF-OPEN-SOURCE" target="_blank"&gt;swimsuit calendar&lt;/a&gt;, created as a part of his crowdfunding campaign. My illustrations for the calendar (see example above) were of the heroes and heroines of Free Software, Open Hardware and Free Culture, depicting some of the people who have done most to exemplify or further the cause of a more open, collaborative or more freedom-conscious approach to working, thinking and licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was sent as a thank-you to Sam's crowdfunding donors, and due to his focus on Open Source, he also wished to release the images online, with an Attribution-ShareAlike licence, so that people could download, remix and distribute the images. Working with Sam and learning about the people I was illustrating made me think a lot more about the licensing I used for my own work, and since then I have licensed my personal (non-commercial) work under an Attribution ShareAlike licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose that particular licence because I like that the Attribution ShareAlike licence gives others the freedom to be able to use my work in any way they wish to, but only if they then allow others to use that work in the same way. By including the sharealike restriction in the licence, if someone wishes to use my work commercially then they must also open up their own work, which I feel is a positive thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JC_CC_SELF_PORTRAIT.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-426" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JC_CC_SELF_PORTRAIT-300x300.png" alt="Judith Carnaby, Self Portrait" width="300" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Judith Carnaby, Self Portrait. Licensed CC BY-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting recent developments for illustration has been the large-scale and high-resolution releases of public domain images from the collections of &lt;a title="Rijksmuseum" href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/explore-the-collection" target="_blank"&gt;institutions in the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a title="British Library" href="http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/welcome.htm" target="_blank"&gt;UK &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a title="New York Public Library" href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/" target="_blank"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;. Having a huge wealth of unrestricted imagery that can be used and remixed opens up new ways of working, as well as deepening understanding the history and development of illustration as a discipline. More broadly, these online collections of illustrations give us greater and important access to the world's cultural history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my personal work I can choose to license my work as I wish to, but my commercial work is often restricted due to the different needs of my clients. Copyright of commissioned illustrations usually belongs to me, the author of the work, unless there is an agreement for specific use of the illustration. That can depend on what clients are wanting to use the work for, and what length of time. For example, they may wish to use the image online for two months, or two years, after which I can resell or republish it as I wish. Contracts can include agreements that I, or the client, cannot use the illustration for any other purpose other than what was agreed upon. Using copyright agreements often protects an illustrator from being taken advantage of, but most businesses have a limited view on what copyright means and can unnecessarily restrict an illustrator’s right (or sometimes need) to reuse, remix or resell an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to work with clients who are aware of CC licences and use them in their own businesses. For example, I created the cover design for Thomasin Sleigh's novel &lt;a title="Ad Lib" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/AD-LIB" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a title="Ad Lib case study" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/ad-lib-novel-published-cc/" target="_blank"&gt;published under a CC licence&lt;/a&gt;. Another example is the info-video for a bicycle sharing platform, &lt;a title="BikeSurf Berlin" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/filter/moving%20image/BIKESURF-ORG" target="_blank"&gt;BikeSurf Berlin&lt;/a&gt; (see below). To me it makes complete sense to license my work in this way. However, I am disappointed that no one seems to have used or remixed my personal work at all!&lt;/p&gt;

The documents, detailing life on the nation’s first missions, were brought back from London more than a century ago by &lt;a title="Hocken Library" href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/hocken/" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Hocken&lt;/a&gt; and have been transcribed by Retired Associate Professor Gordon Parsonson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the&lt;a title="Marsden Archive" href="http://marsdenarchive.otago.ac.nz/home" target="_blank"&gt; Marsden Archive website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was a collaborative project undertaken by the University of Otago Library and the University’s Centre for Research on Colonial Culture. This project to create the Marsden Online Archive set out to achieve a number of objectives including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Creating digital objects from historically significant, unique, items in the Hocken Collections.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Providing appropriate metadata for these resources, so to enrich contextual information and extend discoverability.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Identifying and deploying appropriate technical and discovery standards to ensure accessibility, preservation and curation.&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Developing an appropriate platform, structure and web interface to make the collections useful as a research asset.”&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Vanessa Gibbs, Business Analyst and Mining Marsden Project Manager at the University of Otago Library, speaks about the use of Creative Commons in the Mining Marsden Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Project Sponsor for the Marsden Online Archive was already familiar with Creative Commons licensing. He recommended the use of the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 New Zealand (&lt;a title="Licences explained" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/"&gt;CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 NZ&lt;/a&gt;) licence to Gordon Parsonson (the copyright owner of the transcripts). We chose that particular licence because we wanted to make sure Gordon would continue to get attribution for his work, but we didn’t want to stop other researchers being able to build upon the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From there it was an easy decision to use the same agreement for the digital images and metadata. The Creative Commons licence structure provides a clear and easily understood framework for the application of copyright licences. It was easy for us to apply the licence and it is easy for our users to understand the terms under which they can use the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we are using the same licence for both the transcripts and the images and metadata, we have set up a&lt;a title="Terms of use" href="http://marsdenarchive.otago.ac.nz/terms" target="_blank"&gt; terms of use webpage&lt;/a&gt;. Here we detail when Gordon needs to be attributed and when the Hocken Collections needs to be attributed. This way there is no confusion for our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had really great buy-in from staff on the Marsden Online Archive. They are now more open to using a Creative Commons licence for other material. I guess they see Marsden as a test case for using a CC licence and so far it has been very successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are already a number of other projects that Library staff are discussing using Creative Commons licensing for. Hopefully the success of the Marsden Online Archive will highlight the usefulness of the CC licensing framework.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In line with international ‘&lt;a title="Open GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/openglam/" target="_blank"&gt;open GLAM&lt;/a&gt;’ recommendations, principle four advises that 'negotiations with rights owners and donors will promote and be informed by the Creative Commons licensing framework as a mechanism to facilitate use and reuse of in-copyright works.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principle five states that 'where no copyright restriction applies, NLNZ will seek to provide the items for use and reuse with a statement of "no known copyright restrictions", after careful consideration of cultural and ethical issues relating to the items.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other principles address the use of appropriate resolution size, the &lt;a href="https://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/detailed-nzgoal-factsheet/" target="_blank"&gt;Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework&lt;/a&gt;, and the treatment of ‘orphan’ works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader at the Alexander Turnbull Library at the National Library of New Zealand, first drafted the policy in early 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he points out, “The purpose of the policy is to be able to have a consistent framework across the NLNZ for all of our reuse activities, from supply to management to delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the supply side -- such as our negotiations and agreements with publishers and donors -- the policy attempts to clarify what we say about reuse, and the metadata we use, as early in the process as possible. On the delivery side, the policy covers clear and consistent statements, resolution, and also trying to get the Library to have more items available under 'no known copyright' restrictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark notes that the initial conversations between the institution and the donor are critical, as this is where conditions around the reuse of collections items are formed. These conditions “flow through the entire life of the collection while it’s with us, which is in perpetuity," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why principle four advises that 'negotiations with rights owners and donors will promote and be informed by the Creative Commons licensing framework.' As part of the implementation of the principle, the Library is likely to add a Creative Commons tick-box on the donor form, and provide donors with a range of explanatory resources. Donors will retain the right to restrict access to their work, if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage of the use and reuse policy took around eighteen months. “It was a series of conversations. It was important that we took our time and listened. The different perspectives in society around use and reuse -- which can be a relatively contentious issue -- also exist in the Library itself. As an institution, we just talked our way through these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a collecting institution, we managed to get a general agreement as to the purpose of what we do: we develop collections, and make them accessible (including through digitisation), because we want people to use them. It was important to clarify that the accessibility and use concepts were different. That was a critical point for moving forward with the policy work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the policy has been adopted, the Library is working to implement its principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re now establishing our process for the 'no known copyright' test, supporting principle five in the policy. We have a process to identify which collections go through the test, which includes considering any cultural or ethical reasons to restrict reuse - but still provide access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of great people in the Library have worked hard to determine those cultural and ethical criteria. Some of this work is challenging those criteria, but it’s also reaffirming some of them. We haven’t yet determined all of the reasons to restrict reuse on a cultural basis, though the idea with the 'no known copyright test' is that we’ll be able to determine some of those criteria as we go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re also developing procedures to follow when some works are reused in a way that go against the restrictions set by the Library or by donors. This goes to that amorphous issue of trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/H513.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-412" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/H513.jpg" alt="Howitzer batteries in action at Spice Farm, 1918.

(Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association: New Zealand official negatives, World War 1914-1918. Ref: 1/2-013131-G. Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand. No known copyright restrictions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Library is also undertaking to map the array of restrictions placed on works by its donors over the years, to ensure that online users are always made aware of these restrictions, while at the same time aiming for clear and consistent rights statements across the Library’s collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a title="NLNZ blog" href="http://natlib.govt.nz/blog/posts/our-new-use-and-reuse-policy" target="_blank"&gt;Mark wrote on the NLNZ blog&lt;/a&gt;, “It sounds simple but there are a lot of current, past, and future permissions and rights statements we have to be able to reflect, cutting across sizeable and diverse collections, in different systems with differing technological capability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NLNZ policy follows &lt;a title="Te Papa’s openly licensed images" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/te-papas-openly-licensed-images/" target="_blank"&gt;the release of nearly 40,000 high-resolution images by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa&lt;/a&gt;, under either a Creative Commons licence or a no-known-copyright statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark believes that other collecting institutions are likely to follow in the footsteps of Te Papa and NLNZ -- and other international institutions like the &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/" target="_blank"&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt; -- and is curious to see which approach other institutions take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While Te Papa and NLNZ share the same objectives -- i.e. getting no-known-copyright images in high resolution available online -- our approaches have differed slightly. Te Papa’s approach is more to release large numbers of images in order to demonstrate value, which is great, they’ve done a magnificent job. On the other hand, the Library took more of a policy approach to get our thinking and framework in place before implementing. I think both are relevant. It will be interesting to see how these approaches play out and what other institutions do. I think both Te Papa and the National Library have demonstrated useful paths forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first collection released by NLNZ under the policy is the ‘H series’ of photographs from World War One, which is, as &lt;a title="WW1 photographs" href="http://ww100.govt.nz/photographing-new-zealanders-at-war" target="_blank"&gt;Melanie Lovell-Smith points out&lt;/a&gt;, “the most comprehensive visual record of New Zealanders on the Western front from 1917 to 1918.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update as at April 2015:&lt;/strong&gt; Te Papa has now released over 20,000 images under Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) licence, and over 25,000 under No Known Copyright Restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is just the start”, says Rights Advisor Victoria Leachman. “We’re constantly improving our database, constantly collecting, constantly digitising. At launch we released thirty thousand and we aim to make another fifteen thousand images available for download by the end of this financial year.” Releasing images of the collection for download is now a core part of the workflow of copyright assessment for Victoria. “It’s no longer a one-off project. It’s now a business-as-usual activity and providing the highest-resolution image file we can means much wider scope for potential reuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Te Papa’s engagement with issues of copyright, licensing and openness &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/" target="_blank"&gt;has been a long process&lt;/a&gt; and will continue to evolve. “We need to keep finding a balance between making images freely available and reuseable to benefit the public good and ensuring cost recovery so we astutely manage our taxpayer funding to help keep the museum going,” says Victoria. “We will continue to respond as Creative Commons grows as a movement within New Zealand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victoria’s philosophy throughout has been one of incremental change: “let’s iterate!” She says “GLAM professionals tend to be completists, even perfectionists, and this isn’t a project you’re ever going to be able to ‘finish’. One of the big messages I’m always trying to get across is to start with what you can do now, at the foot of the mountain. Don’t worry about what’s at the top. It might get solved as you go and, if it doesn’t, you can better concentrate on solving it when you get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project’s launch in June 2014 generated a lot of positive feedback for Te Papa, both nationally and internationally. There was a significant visitation spike to the Collections Online site. Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage &lt;a title="Press release" href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/AboutUs/Media/Pages/FreeAccessto30000HighResolutionImagesfromTePapasdigitalcollections.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Finlayson has recognised&lt;/a&gt; Te Papa’s efforts and said: “These images from the national collection are a fantastic resource for New Zealanders. The Government’s &lt;a title="NZGOAL" href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Access Licensing Framework&lt;/a&gt; cuts red tape, allowing the public to share and enjoy these thousands of images freely, as well as making them more readily available for use by professionals in the education, historical, cultural, and creative sectors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Another benefit of this work is the internal efficiency savings.” Victoria noted that Collections Online is used heavily by Te Papa’s own staff, and the new, clearer copyright and open licensing statements mean less confusion, less worry about inadvertently doing something illegal, and significantly less time taken up processing rights requests and queries. “Staff can cut straight through the necessary copyright bureaucracy and just do it themselves, if they need an image for a sign, say, or an e-newsletter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course the main benefit is the creative and collaborative potential that freely available public domain or out-of-copyright and CC-licensed works bestow. One example close to home is the creation of a new artwork for the &lt;i&gt;Ngā Toi Arts Te Papa&lt;/i&gt; exhibition: &lt;a title="Arts Te Papa" href="http://arts.tepapa.govt.nz/on-the-wall/knowledge-on-a-beam-of-starlight-panel-1/8015" target="_blank"&gt;“Knowledge on a beam of starlight”&lt;/a&gt;, a vinyl work by Kerry Ann Lee using found images and questions. With Te Papa’s permission Lee used images downloaded from Collections Online in her artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s next for Creative Commons at Te Papa? “Now we need to analyse the results so far, so that we can keep improving.” Victoria wants to learn how people are using the images, and what effect the freely downloadable content is having on Te Papa’s image licensing business. She is also very focussed on spreading the word, and making sure that Kiwis know that their cultural treasures are emerging into the free digital domain. “Creative Commons is still really early days in New Zealand. We want people to know what’s available and how they can use these incredible treasures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/11/10/te-papas-open-images.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2014 21:00:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Kiwi novel published under Creative Commons</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/10/13/kiwi-novel-published-under-creative-commons.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author &lt;a title="Thom Sleigh" href="https://twitter.com/TSleigher" target="_blank"&gt;Thomasin Sleigh&lt;/a&gt; has published her debut novel, &lt;a title="Ad Lib" href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz/p/ad-lib-by-thomasin-sleigh.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, under Creative Commons &lt;a title="CC licence" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;BY-NC-SA&lt;/a&gt; 4.0 licence, with the publishing collective &lt;a title="Lawrence &amp;amp; Gibson publishers" href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence and Gibson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomasin’s work at Digital NZ to open up Aotearoa’s cultural treasures for sharing and reuse has informed her decision to license her own work under CC. “Publishing &lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt; under a Creative Commons licence was very much an ideological decision. I am an advocate for unlocking cultural resources and, even though my book is published in paper format at the moment, and so is relatively difficult to copy compared to an ebook, I wanted to contribute to the creative commons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomasin has chosen a licence that gives people advance permission to use her work in their own creations, as long as they attribute her and don’t make money from it. “Because I don’t write fiction for a living, I have the freedom to release my work in a way that might be more difficult for professional novelists.” She is also concerned with future-proofing. “The media landscape is only going to change, and keep changing ever more rapidly. I don’t want there to be any confusion in the future about how my work is to be treated.” Fundamentally, Thomasin sees potential reuse as a compliment, not a threat: “if anyone wanted to use or copy from &lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt;, I would be genuinely flattered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing a paper book under a CC licence is relatively unusual, and Thomasin was lucky to be published by Lawrence and Gibson, a Wellington-based publishing collective that is open to new and experimental ways of doing things. The cover for &lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt; was designed by Berlin-based illustrator &lt;a title="Judith Carnaby" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/AD-LIB" target="_blank"&gt;Judith Carnaby&lt;/a&gt;, who licenses her work under CC BY-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ADLIB_FRONT_COVER_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-6307 size-medium" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ADLIB_FRONT_COVER_2-207x300.jpg" alt="Ad Lib book cover" width="207" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Book cover of Ad Lib by Thomasin Sleigh; designed by Judith Carnaby; licensed CC BY-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The printing for &lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt; was done by hand at &lt;a title="Rebel Press" href="http://www.rebelpress.org.nz/about" target="_blank"&gt;Rebel Press&lt;/a&gt;, an anarchist publishing collective that also offers printing services. Thomasin says that the print irregularities resulting from this handmade process are “love letters from me to the reader”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AdLib2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-6311 size-medium" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AdLib2-300x225.jpg" alt="Ad Lib during the printing process; licensed CC BY-SA" width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ad Lib during the printing process; licensed CC BY-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;i&gt;Ad Lib&lt;/i&gt; were to be published as an ebook in the future, Thomasin says she would definitely license it BY-NC-SA as well. As well as opening up her own work, Thomasin’s licensing decision has exposed publishers at Lawrence and Gibson to the possibilities of book publishing with Creative Commons, so watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thomasin is the Community Manager at &lt;a title="Digital NZ" href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Digital NZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, a search and data service, which seeks to make Aotearoa's digital treasures easy to find, share, and use. On the international stage, Thomasin is a member of the &lt;a title="OpenGLAM" href="http://openglam.org/working-group/" target="_blank"&gt;OpenGLAM Working Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, a global network of people who work to open up cultural data and content in the GLAM sector (galleries, libraries, archives and museums). Thomasin has an MA in art history and a background in writing contemporary art criticism.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/10/13/kiwi-novel-published-under-creative-commons.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2014 01:40:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Lincoln University's Open Access Policy</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/10/09/lincoln-universitys-open-access-policy.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2013, Lincoln University passed &lt;a href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/About/Policies/Open-Access-Policy/" target="_blank"&gt;a wide-ranging Open Access policy&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first New Zealand university to do so. Coverage includes research outputs including data, teaching materials and the University’s business records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy states that “as an organisation Lincoln University has a policy position which endorses making content openly and freely available as the first and preferred option.” It goes on to state that "Lincoln University takes a broad ethical position which asserts that if public funding has supported the creation of an idea, research or other content then it is reasonable and fair that it be made publicly accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy also encourages copyright owners “to apply a Creative Commons Licence to their intellectual output to determine how material may be used, reused or repurposed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/staff-profile?staffId=Penny.Carnaby" target="_blank"&gt;Penny Carnaby, the University Librarian at Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, had been aware of the benefits of open access and open licensing since her time as National Librarian at the National Library of New Zealand (NLNZ), where she participated in the Chief Executives’ steering group on open data and information during the development of &lt;a href="https://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/" target="_blank"&gt;NZGOAL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approved by Cabinet in 2010, NZGOAL -- the New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework -- supports and advocates for the uptake of Creative Commons licensing for copyright works produced or funded by State Services agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From her experience at NLNZ, Penny became particularly interested in opening up copyright works produced by the university sector -- including journal articles, datasets and educational resources. She also noted the growing importance of &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/institutional-repositories-101/" target="_blank"&gt;Institutional Repositories&lt;/a&gt; in research libraries around the world as a way of ensuring much greater public access to the intellectual output of an academic institution. Penny had been at National Library when the network of IRs was established, along with the NLNZ managed &lt;a href="http://www.nzresearch.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;NZResearch&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a DigitalNZ powered harvester to gather information from research deposited in repositories across the New Zealand research sector and make them easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting the strength of &lt;a href="http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/10/09/www.researcharchive@lincoln.ac.nz." target="_blank"&gt;Lincoln’s Institutional Repository, LURA,&lt;/a&gt; Penny began to investigate what it would take to develop an open access policy at Lincoln -- New Zealand’s first -- in line with other universities around the world. The policy was given strong support from the Vice Chancellor, Dr Andrew West, who nominated open access as a business driver for the university in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0-MfI4ma-U?rel=0&amp;amp;w=560&amp;amp;h=315]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strong institutional support enabled a process of consultation across the university, which gave university staff an opportunity to voice concerns before the policy was approved. The university also developed a joint union and management working party, which spent six months working through issues and developing a final policy that the university community could be comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penny notes that research staff were, generally speaking, comfortable with the principle of open scholarship, as they could see the inherent benefits of OA to disseminating their research to a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same was not true of open educational resources, which was a relatively novel concept to most teaching staff. “Academics are generally dual professionals,” Penny points out. “Each profession -- teaching and research -- has different drivers. Researchers are often fundamentally motivated by the desire to see their published works have a broad public impact. We found that the same is not necessarily true of academic teaching resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the end, we developed an elegant and respectful solution: the copyright to educational resources would remain with the creator, while the university would retain the right to use these resources for the educational purposes of the institution -- such as using them as open educational resources in MOOCs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penny notes that this process of discussion and consultation was both the most important and most difficult part of implementing open access across the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to support the implementation process, &lt;a href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/About/News/Current-news/Te-Wiki--Open-Access-Week-events/" target="_blank"&gt;Lincoln held its Open Access Week in July&lt;/a&gt;, holding several public events, including a talk by Dr Mark Hahnel, CEO of &lt;a href="http://figshare.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Figshare&lt;/a&gt;, and a debate on Open Access, with the moot 'Open Access or Open Slather?' Penny was placed on the 'Open Slather' team, and &lt;a title="Researcher’s Lament" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/pennys-poem/" target="_blank"&gt;presented this poem as part of her argument&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events helped expose awareness gaps in the institution, which a university wide implementation group is helping to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penny advises other other institutions developing an OA policy to “make the policy itself as broad as possible -- including not only research articles but educational resources and even public records. Institutions will also need to develop the policies alongside other, existing policy settings, such as data management and intellectual property.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And then think very carefully about implementation. Implementation is everything.” At Lincoln, this process of implementing the policy has led to -- at last count -- eighty-seven discrete activities across the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Open Access changes every conversation you have,” says Penny. “Rather than arguing why works need to be open, the focus at Lincoln University is on why certain works need to be closed. This requires a massive cultural shift to take place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The above video is produced for open access week by &lt;a href="http://learn.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Learn Canterbury&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/10/09/lincoln-universitys-open-access-policy.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2014 23:20:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The University of Waikato</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/10/07/the-university-of-waikato.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 4 March 2014, the University of Waikato &lt;a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/news-events/media/2014/03university-of-waikato-approves-open-access-mandate-guidelines.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;announced the passage of an open access mandate&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first university to adopt a direct deposit mandate in New Zealand, and the second university, after Lincoln, to adopt an institutional OA policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary principle driving the adoption of the policy, as stated on its opening line, is that “Freedom to exchange ideas and to publish acquired knowledge are fundamental to the purposes of a university.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy represents the University of Waikato’s commitment “to the concept of open access to knowledge through the deposit of full text, academic publications into the University’s digital repository, the Research Commons, wherever possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The momentum for the policy was established during &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/a/waikato.ac.nz/open-access-week-2012/panel-sessions" target="_blank"&gt;Open Access Week 2012,&lt;/a&gt; when OA advocates Fabiana Kubke and Alex Holcombe spoke at a panel entitled, ‘An Open Access Mandate for the University of Waikato?’ The panel generated interest in OA from the university community, and led to David Nichols, Senior Lecturer in Computer Science, and Ross Hallett, University Librarian, to develop a detailed paper outlining the benefits, risks and options for an OA policy at the University of Waikato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that paper, David and Ross deliberately provided the university with options as to what the final OA policy might look like. As David says, “We deliberately provided the university with a range of options and wording for the policy. We also made sure that we explicitly laid out the costs and benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In presenting the policy to groups within the university, David emphasised the importance of the digital visibility of the institution and noted the successful deposit mandate in place for student theses since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of benefits, David and Ross pointed to the increased download rates, potential citation advantages, as well as the broader importance of making the university’s research available to the wider society, including industry, university alumni and professional groups, such as teachers and journalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David notes that higher ideals, such as the need for the public to have access to publicly funded research, were also emphasised during the consultation process. This ties in nicely with the motto of the university “Ko Te Tangata - For the People” -- a motto which ended up introducing the policy for its embodiment of the university’s “commitment to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After releasing the paper, it travelled for several months -- with David and Ross-- through the various committees of the university, a process which enabled staff from every school and faculty to provide comment and raise potential concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such concern was the question of what happens if infringing material is uploaded to the IR. Some academics were concerned about possible liability, should they mistakenly upload material for which they do not have the rights. They were reassured when told that Library repository staff would continue to offer a mediated deposit service, checking publisher copyright agreements for potential infringement before adding items to the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation process also provided the opportunity to clarify confusion around green and gold OA, as well as the names publishers give to document versions at different stages of the review process, such as ‘preprint’, ‘postprint’ and ‘published’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David noted that it was also important for Waikato to include a waiver in their policy, for those publications that may not be appropriate for deposit in the IR. “It was important that the policy wasn’t seen as entirely black and white.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the widely accepted OA colour scheme, Waikato’s policy is green, with no references to gold (or publisher-implemented) OA or Creative Commons licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As David points out, “We’ve restricted the definition of OA for this policy to ‘read-only.’ The policy doesn’t engage with reuse rights at all. These are issues that we may be able to address in future revisions, though it was important that this policy took the simplest first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A general notion of incrementalism was essential to the whole process, especially given the fact that scholarly publishing is a changing landscape, with many moving parts, including requirements from external funders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incremental approach followed those taken by comparable institutions overseas, such as Queensland University to Technology, who have had a deposit mandate since 2004. David and Ross consulted with QUT during the development of the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“QUT have also made public useful information about the progress of their policy over time, including graphs of the effects on deposit rates. Their model suggested that we needed to take a long term approach to implementing the policy -- there was never going to be an instant change. Progress will be gradual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons why Waikato didn’t follow the example of another leading OA institution, the University of Liège, which mandates that only works deposited in the Institutional Repository will be considered during internal promotion and review. While this is a good model for increasing the number of works in the IR, it is potentially less helpful for gaining support from researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David is now working with the Library, Research Office and Information Technology Services to implement a new research information system -- called Symplectic Elements-- to help reduce the transaction costs of depositing research into the university’s repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As David pointed out, while the policy is important, the means of technically implementing the policy must be as smooth as possible. With the new system, the time commitment required by the academic to deposit an article should be no more than the time required to respond to an email request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new system will also help Waikato determine the baseline number of OA articles currently published by university staff, which will make it easier to chart progress in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, David underlines the importance of basing the OA efforts at the library. He also advises other institutions looking at OA to factor in a lot of consultation and listening to staff. As disciplines have their own norms and terminology, it’s also important to find advocates across the university’s various schools and faculties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David also reiterates the importance of not trying to solve all the problems with scholarly publishing in one fell swoop. “The policy,” David says, “is just the first step.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/10/07/the-university-of-waikato.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2014 01:38:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Taupaki School</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/06/10/taupaki-school.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.taupaki.school.nz/Site/Our_School_2.ashx"&gt;Taupaki School&lt;/a&gt; is a co-educational primary school, located an hour north-west of Auckland. On 20 February 2013, Taupaki School’s Board of Trustees passed a Creative Commons policy, giving permission to Taupaki’s teachers to share and collaborate, legally.
&lt;p&gt;Paula Hogg has been the chair of the Taupaki BoT since 2012, and oversaw the passage of the Creative Commons policy. As Paula explains, the idea for the policy was initially introduced by the school’s principal, Stephen Lethbridge. While the BoT didn’t have any specific expertise on copyright or intellectual property, Stephen ensured that they had all the necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got a great letter from Stephen outlining all the issues, and following that we put it on the agenda for the next meeting. Stephen provided a lot of information for us to read prior to that meeting, so we felt quite well prepared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, copyright and intellectual property were new issues for the BoT. As Paula says, “Creative Commons was something we’d never heard of -- it wasn’t even on the periphery. While we were aware of copyright laws, we were not as well informed around exactly what was Board and teacher owned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to New Zealand’s &lt;a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/57.0/whole.html#DLM345930"&gt;1994 Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;, employers hold first ownership of copyright works produced in the course of employment. &lt;a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/Copyright-in-Schools/Guidelines-for-schools/For-teachers-and-contractors/Overview-of-copyright-issues#who"&gt;As is stated in TKI&lt;/a&gt;, the Ministry of Education’s information portal, this means that, “Unless agreed otherwise, the school will own the copyright in any teaching materials that teachers (employees) create during the course of their employment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, this means that teachers who share resources may often be infringing the school's copyright. Creative Commons policies solve this problem by enabling the school to give advance permission to all teachers to legally share and collaborate using an open Creative Commons licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Lethbridge introduced the idea of the policy after noticing that, as he put it in a &lt;a href="http://stephenlethbridge.com/?p=135"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, that “teachers were sharing more on more resources online and connecting with a great many schools who were visiting us. It would have been a nightmare to seek permission from the board, more likely the school principal, every time a teacher or student wanted to share information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Paula points out, the policy is also strongly aligned with the school’s existing vision. “Our school’s vision strongly encourages collaboration, and we encourage sharing, so it was a bit of a shock to learn that we needed to have a policy for teachers to share legally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Creative Commons policy was very aligned with our thinking as a board. There was no dissonance in our discussion. The main issue was that everyone was surprised to discover that this isn’t normal practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Paula, the CC policy passed because it supported the fundamental mission of the school -- improving student outcomes. “We knew from the documentation Stephen provided, and from other background reading, that professional development is actually one of the best ways to lift student outcomes. And a big part of professional development is sharing best practice, including resources”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula also points out the importance of BoTs aligning their school with existing government policy. While the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/nzgoal" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework&lt;/a&gt; encourages schools to use CC to release copyright works, relatively few schools are aware that the policy exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of policy and procedural issues confronting schools, it’s also unlikely that BoTs will seek out additional policy changes that aren’t brought to their attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important that Boards don’t just view this as a legal obligation and stop there. It does encompass a lot more than that, and it’s important that Boards are aware of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Stephen points out, “With the &lt;a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/portal/"&gt;Network for Learning Portal&lt;/a&gt; just around the corner school leaders need to revisit their intellectual property documentation. Creative Commons in Schools isn’t about abdicating responsibility and a copy anything approach. It is about acknowledgement, respect and attribution where the license is determined by the creators of amazing information, resources and ideas within our schools.”&lt;/p&gt;
