&lt;p&gt;These events will be a chance to discuss how Creative Commons is being used across New Zealand's school and GLAM sectors. Our schools and GLAM organisations make and look after an extraordinary amount of high-quality works, and we think that there are massive social, cultural and economic benefits to sharing this work more openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we have events planned Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Hawkes Bay, New Plymouth, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Wellington, Nelson, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Westport. But we're keen to do even more! If you want CC to come to your organisation or region, and can help us find a venue and an audience, we'll be sure to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're keen to attend any of these events, please fill out the form below! There are more details regarding times, dates, venues and speakers on &lt;a title="Creative Commons Roadtrip – GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/"&gt;GLAM events here&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a title="Creative Commons Roadtrip – Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/"&gt;schools events here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big thanks to our partners, Land Information New Zealand and InternetNZ, for enabling us to hold these events. Also, a big thanks to LIANZA and Te Papa for partnering with us on the GLAM events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) is the kaitiaki of the Creative Commons (CC) licences in Aotearoa New Zealand. We provide free legal tools that help people release their works for others to share and reuse, in order to grow the commons, that store of works freely available to access and reuse. Learn more at &lt;a title="Home" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/"&gt;creativecommons.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Creative Commons Licences and Māori Works&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CC licences are not always considered appropriate for Māori cultural works. CC licences cannot be applied to works that no longer qualify for copyright protection, which is likely to be true of many older Māori works. Also, the licences do not provide protections against culturally offensive or otherwise inappropriate uses of Māori works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Free Legal Notice for Māori Works&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, CCANZ is looking to produce a free legal notice that Māori can use to release cultural works more openly. The notice will be a clear and standard expression of the freedoms and restrictions that cultural producers or kaitiaki of Māori cultural works wish to apply. While the notice cannot grant additional legal protections, it will aim to educate the public about the status of Māori works, while at the same time allowing for greater access, sharing and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why a 'Notice' and not a 'Licence'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 'licence' is based on rights that are legally recognised, and full legal recognition of rights to mātauranga Māori and taonga works does not yet exist. A 'notice' will help to ensure that members of the public are aware of the status of a particular work, and also know how to share and reuse it appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How Will It Work?

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the details are yet to be determined, it is likely that a statement and symbol would be attached to a work. These would, in turn, link to a standard, legally robust statement of the freedoms and restrictions that the work's kaitiaki wish to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;More Information&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Land Information New Zealand officials, prompted by the support in NZGOAL for free culture CC licenses, started liberating the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/09/linz-data-service/" target="_blank"&gt;publicly-funded map data they hold&lt;/a&gt; under CC-BY, they may have anticipated that their data could end up in OpenStreetMap.org (OSM). OSM is the libre licensed, crowdsourced, world mapping project (formerly CC-BY-SA, now Open DataBase License) created as a free-as-in-speech alternative to Google Maps, which licenses copyright map and image data from other companies. What they probably never imagined was their data appearing on community sites like the new NSW government funded &lt;a href="http://www.timebanking.com.au/" target="_blank"&gt;TimeBanking platform&lt;/a&gt; and in maps powered by Leafet, the free code, mobile-friendly, web map engine which uses OSM as the default source for map data. Such are the unintended benefits that flow from sharing in the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-6030" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg" alt="X" width="546" height="366"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Screenshot of &lt;a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/1910-otago-075m-rural-aerial-photos-2004-2011/" target="_blank"&gt;Otago 0.75m aerial photography&lt;/a&gt; by LINZ. Made available under a Creative Commons Attribution licence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as OSM contributed to the development of websites using Leaflet, the cultural commons also has a contribution to make to the development of free code speech recognition software. Douglas Bagnall gave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BGLrLXm3c" target="_blank"&gt;a great talk&lt;/a&gt; about free code speech recognition engines at Kiwi PyCon 2012, and one of the main non-coding challenges he identified is the lack of a suitably large corpus of spoken speech with which to train' the software (the interesting bits for non-coders starts at about 3:00), particularly for less common accents like New Zealand English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas mentioned a site called VoxForge.org and encouraged us all to record some speech for it. VoxForge collects samples of speech to "compile them into acoustic models for use with Open Source speech recognition engines", with both the acoustic models and the source data are made available under the GNU General Public License, the free code software license used by the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voxforge is a great resource, but it would be a lot of work to drive enough 'Nu Zylnd' accented speakers there. and it occurred to me recently that there is another source of spoken speech for which there is strong argument for libre licensing; public interest radio. Releasing audio programs made for National Radio, student radio, and community access radio, under a libre license (eg CC-BY), has always seemed like a no-brainer to me. Even before I set up &lt;a href="http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/05/07/cc-nz@groups.creativecommons.org.nz" target="_blank"&gt;the CC-NZ email list&lt;/a&gt;, I was contacting community radio people and telling them about the potential benefits of podcasting and CC licensing for increasing program exposure, as part of my work with Aotearoa.Indymedia.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Radio are publicly-owned and funded, and currently podcast all their programs in both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats. Student radio stations have also been experimenting with recording their shows and turning them into podcasts, and if they libre licensed the sometimes substantial spoken word parts of recordings like &lt;a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/radio1/" target="_blank"&gt;the Radio1 shows shared on MixCloud&lt;/a&gt;, they'd be unlikely to miss out on any commercial return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community access radio stations, as their name suggests, exist to give special interest groups in our communities access to the airwaves, so their unique voices have a chance to be heard in broadcast media. Access stations are heavily subsidised by public broadcasting funding, and their programs aren't expected to have commercial potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever these programs are rebroadcast, both the program producers, and the public who subsidize their production, get more bang for their buck. Over the last decade or so, access radio stations have been building up the infrastructure to digitally record programs, so they can be made available as podcasts, on sites like accessradio.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I notice in all three cases though, is that despite NZGOAL-inspired wave of CC license adoptions across public service organisations from LINZ, to schools and tertiary institutions, to archives and museums, I see no sign of CC licenses on locally made radio so far. I'm guessing one issue is legal confusion and risk aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if I want to CC my radio program, what about the copyright songs I played during the program? Who owns the copyright on ads, and is it acceptable to remove them? Radio stations and rebroadcast sites can pay a fixed fee to collection organisations like NZRIA and APRA for permission to play the songs, but they can't pass on that permission to anyone who rebroadcasts the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do to show public radio stations that libre licensing - CC or otherwise - is a good fit for their organizational mission, and help them negotiate the legal minefields around copyright? Between them, the RadioNZ, community access, and students stations have vast numbers of hours of recordings, covering a wide range of kiwi accents spoken regularly on ethnic community radio programs. Having these available under a libre license would have benefits beyond just sharing the information and perspective included in public interest radio programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also be tremendously helpful to people working on getting free code/ open source speech recognition software to recognise New Zilnd accents, which in turn would be tremendously helpful for any kiwi wanting a speech-operated computer that respects their software freedom. The same would be true for speakers of Te Reo Māori, and other Polynesian languages, who, like NZ English speakers, are also less likely to record enough speech at sites like VoxForge for them to generate a useful acoustic model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In '&lt;a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Coming Civil War over General Purpose Computing&lt;/a&gt;', Cory Doctorow asks us to consider the implications if the proprietary software running on many of our personal computers was instead running on our bionic legs;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;"If I can lo-jack your legs, I can lease them to you with the confidence of my power to repo them if you default on payments. If I can't, I may not lease you legs unless you've got a lot of money to begin with. But if your legs can decide to walk to the repo-depot without your consent, you will be totally screwed the day that muggers, rapists, griefers or the secret police figure out how to hijack that facility."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like bionic legs, accessibility tools like speech recognition and text-to-speech are augmentations which restore equalit, helping people with conditions from blindness to quadraplegia to have the full use of computers and the internet that most of us take for granted. Such essential tools should not be subject to the price pumping and hidden agendas that go with proprietary sofware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard White is an interesting example of an artist using CC to make his own creative output available, while working in a job that clearly demonstrates the pitfalls and possibilities of copyright and open access day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard has made two of his albums available for download on Bandcamp, &lt;a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;under the name Mermaid Guitar&lt;/a&gt;. He began by offering his earlier album, &lt;a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/album/me-for-a-day" target="_blank"&gt;‘Me for a Day’&lt;/a&gt;, with a five dollar price tag, and then decided to offer ‘Barry Starr’ for free, with the “name your price” function, where users choose how much they’d like to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being available for free, the second album has had more downloads &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; more sales -- so he’s now offering the earlier album under the same terms. For Richard, this makes the process of selling an album more exciting. As he puts it, “People have paid a lot more than I thought they might, more than the five dollars I initially offered the first album for."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2754915517 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of others have downloaded his music for free, but Richard says that he’s totally happy with this. “Ultimately I just like the idea that someone’s listening to my music on their iPod on the other side of the world”. But he’s also careful to point out that he doesn’t try to make a living from his music and concedes that, for those who do, there are greater challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the production process, Richard sourced all artwork for ‘Barry Starr’ from Public Domain or CC sources, but he says finding images which could be used with the CC BY SA licence he used for the album, which also fit his purpose, was trickier than he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were some great images I really liked, but they had either ND or, more commonly, NC," Richard says. "Given that people could pay, I couldn’t use NC. I guess the difficulty I had finding good stuff showed me that open access is still at the ‘evangelical’ stage in many respects and we need more converts for it to become more self-sustaining”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2754915517 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By day, Richard works as Copyright Officer at the University of Otago, addressing any copyright issues or questions encountered by staff and research students there. This can be a challenge: while most staff have an understanding of the broad concepts of copyright, it can be a complex web of legislation, licences and rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard has found himself a staunch advocate of open access in the tertiary sector and CC as the main vehicle for that. “CC licences simplify a lot of things from a copyright point of view”, he says. “Often a staff member or a PhD student will come to me or one of our library staff with questions about permission for something they want to use in a piece of research. One of the most common problems is that they just don’t hear from someone they’ve contacted to get permission”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says a lot of the time accessibility is the last thing researchers and academics are thinking about. They’re  used to things being done a certain way and aren’t necessarily aware of the open access alternatives. Their reputations as academics are affected by how often they’re being published in scholarly journals, and the quality of those journals is taken into account too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the major roadblock for open access publications, just getting enough visibility and usage to attract good quality research, to gain a name as a good journal, not just an open access journal. I mean, I’d love it if all research was open”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2765089846 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other countries are mandating that all publicly funded research should be open -- the U.S. Government, for example -- but New Zealand isn’t making any moves yet. Instead academics do their research, write it up, submit it for publication, go through the peer review process, and are accepted into these big journals where they’re published, which universities around the world then pay subscription fees to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appreciates the freedom Creative Commons licences give both creator and reuser, academic and artistic. “When someone has used a CC licence they’ve declared up front what they’re happy for others to do with their work. So part of my work is helping people understand the implications of their choices with their own work as part of the knowledge ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In that respect it’s no different from choosing CC in an artistic medium: you’re sharing your work for others to use and build on.  I can’t claim that my music has informed great cultural achievements but there are people who’ve put it in compilations or used it in their films, which is immensely satisfying”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 2009, we published &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2009/06/671/" target="_blank"&gt;a quick case study&lt;/a&gt; of NZ On Screen, which was then only two years old. With the launch of its sister site, Audio Culture, in 2013, we thought we'd take the opportunity to revisit both projects. Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ intern Hannah Mettner sat down with NZ On Screen Project Director Clarion Coughlan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/" target="_blank"&gt;NZ On Screen&lt;/a&gt; has provided online access to a wealth of New Zealand film, television and music video since 2008. From the outset they’ve used a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial&lt;/a&gt; licence for all the work they put into the site. While the video content belongs to the rightsholders, all the synopses, backgrounds and biographies relating to videos and people is licensed under CC. And this material is impressive in its scope and quality; the introductions to the collections, particularly, are personable as well as thorough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3769054349_9b22d1bd7d_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-5155" alt="3769054349_9b22d1bd7d_z" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3769054349_9b22d1bd7d_z-300x206.jpg" width="300" height="206"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Rock Concert, 1962, by Eric Calonius. &lt;a href="http://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/ExternalIdSearch?id=553890&amp;amp;jScript=true" target="_blank"&gt;US National Archives&lt;/a&gt;, via Flickr. No known copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarion, the Project Director, talks about how they want to make the content &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt;; their aim is not to put everything they possibly can online, but rather to choose culturally significant pieces and give them space to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NZ On Screen is a curated website, carefully chosen and added to, and the context provided by the written material is crucial. Clarion says “rather than just publishing videos, we contextualise them through our writing. As NZ On Screen has been paid for by tax payers (via NZ On Air funding), it makes sense to make that writing available under Creative Commons: To give something back”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having that CC licensed work reused also serves as a useful advertising tool; when writers reuse their pieces on blogs or have them published elsewhere, and actors’ agencies reuse what is effectively a pre-written biography, the CC licence brings people back to the NZ On Screen website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps due to the popularity of NZ On Screen, May 2013 saw the launch of a sister project, &lt;a href="http://www.audioculture.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Audio Culture&lt;/a&gt; – the ‘noisy library of New Zealand music’. The site aims to address the ‘digital silence’ that has surrounded New Zealand music online, and to collect together the stories, multimedia and ephemera that have contributed to NZ music from the last 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AudioCulture kicked off with 250 pages of people, labels and scenes, all under searchable indexes, plus music, interviews and photographs, with another 300 pages following in the second year. It was certainly very well-received, gaining 25,000 page views in its first month live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the successful formula employed over at NZ On Screen, the music on the site is licensed by PPNZ Music Licensing and APRA/AMCOS and the images have been cleared with copyright owners, but the written content in Profiles, Stories, Labels and Scenes all falls under the CC-BY-NC licence. Like the written content on NZ On Screen, these pieces are not brief introductions; they are well-researched and in-depth, written by a wide variety of contributors, often with a personal connection to the subject, providing an extraordinary depth of context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Culture</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/02/04/nz-on-screen-and-audio-culture.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 02:36:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>7 Ways to Find Creative Commons Music</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/07/25/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-music.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Herbert Green, 1919. New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. No known copyright restrictions. (O.009829)There are millions of songs out there under a Creative Commons licence. But how can you find them? Happily, we've compiled a list of the top seven ways to find Creative Commons licensed and public domain music online. Let us know if we've missed anything! And if you're looking to find images or video check our these two companion pieces: &lt;a title="7 Ways to Find Creative Commons Images" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-images/" target="_blank"&gt;7 Ways to Find Creative Commons Images&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="7 Ways To Find Creative Commons Video" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/03/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-video/" target="_blank"&gt;7 Ways to Find Creative Commons Video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Free Music Archive offers thousands of songs under Creative Commons licences, searchable by genre or curator. They also have a bunch of &lt;a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Happy_Birthday_Song_Contest/The_New_Birthday_Song_Contest/" target="_blank"&gt;Happy Birthday songs&lt;/a&gt; to provide an alternative to the famous version, which remains (&lt;a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/2013/mar/08/happy-birthday/" target="_blank"&gt;controversially&lt;/a&gt;) under 'all rights reserved' copyright. I've embedded the winning song below, by Monk Turner + Fascinoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/" target="_blank"&gt;Jamendo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamendo is one of the largest open music sites out there. The site lets you filter by genre; it also ranks tracks according to their popularity. Before you share or reuse a track from Jamendo, be sure to check out the licence at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bandcamp is a site used by many musicians to share and sell their music. The great thing about Bandcamp is that it often gives you the option of &lt;em&gt;paying&lt;/em&gt; the musician. Here's a link to artists tagged &lt;a href="http://bandcamp.com/tag/creative-commons" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt;. You'll be able to tell which licence each artist uses by the small symbols at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2341238158/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=3/transparent=true/"&gt;http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2341238158/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/t=3/transparent=true/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt; &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soundcloud hosts audio from all over the world, including music and radio shows. To find Creative Commons content, enter your search term and click through to your results. Look to the left of your screen, and you should see a few different filters. Click on the category 'sounds' -- as opposed to 'people' or 'groups' -- and then click on the 'licence' button, which will let you filter your results according to a Creative Commons licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://archive.org/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Internet Archive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for music that's already in the public domain, &lt;a href="http://archive.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt; is the place to go. They have all kinds of fabulous out of copyright recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://ccmixter.org/" target="_blank"&gt;ccMixter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ccMixter hosts all kinds of remixed music made available under a &lt;a title="http://creativecommons.org" href="http://creativecommons.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; licence. The site encourages you to listen, remix and share its music. They have also developed a tool called '&lt;a href="http://dig.ccmixter.org/" target="_blank"&gt;dig.ccMixter&lt;/a&gt;', which allows you to filter for music for your podcast, film and commercial projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/blog/posts/the-turnbull-mixtape-mixes-again" target="_blank"&gt;Turnbull Mixtapes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last two years, the National Library of New Zealand has released its own Creative Commons mixtapes, pieced together from legal deposits to their digital music collection. You can check out the latest mix-tape, and also peruse a master-list of CC-licensed albums. While you're in the mood for mix-tapes, you can also &lt;a title="The Creative Commons Playlist" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/05/the-creative-commons-playlist/" target="_blank"&gt;check out our own&lt;/a&gt;, released earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Culture</category><category>Tools</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/07/25/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-music.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2013 21:03:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Vicky Holloway</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/06/18/vicky-holloway.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vicky Holloway is a web designer, animator and illustrator based in Wellington, New Zealand. Some of Vicky’s work is made available under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicky first became aware of Creative Commons in 2005, though it wasn’t until she joined a collaborative art project in 2009 that she seriously considered using Creative Commons licensing. As she says, “We were looking for ways to license our work so that we could share it with other people, and maybe take it further as a group project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While following the &lt;a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Mix &amp;amp; Mash&lt;/a&gt; competitions in 2010 and 2011, Vicky started using Creative Commons licences for &lt;a href="http://www.behance.net/squibbleworld" target="_blank"&gt;her Behance portfolio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she explains, Creative Commons licensing on Behance is “built into the process. You must choose a license before publishing your work and they make it easy to choose which CC license is the best for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Vick-Holloway-image.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-3993" title="Vick Holloway image" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Vick-Holloway-image.png" alt="" width="403" height="227"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://design.squibble.org/themes/tea-party-wallpaper/" target="_blank"&gt;'Tea Party'&lt;/a&gt; by Vicky Holloway is made available under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution Non Commerical No Derivatives 3.0 licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of using Creative Commons licences, Vicky says, is that “it explicitly states ‘this is how I want my work to be used.’ And it also gives a link to further information. The licences make it very straightforward and easy to understand. It makes it easy to tell people what kinds of use you are happy with—and also what kinds of use you’re not happy with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I love how the internet encourages curiosity and creativity. However, the rights of the artist should still be protected. A CC license allows me to state exactly what I want to happen to my work and comes with a clear label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A CC license also gives me the option to share while protecting my copyright. I make a conscious decision on copyright each time I label a graphic, painting or animation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons licences, Vicky says, “protect me as well as the creator. Without a licence, it’s unclear what kinds of sharing and reuse the creator would be comfortable with. It can also be hard to find the owner of the artwork, if you want to legally reuse it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicky is currently licensing her work using a ‘No Derivatives’ licence. “I might be interested in remix for some of my work. At the moment, though, the ‘No Derivatives’ licence gives me the option to retain control over the work. I think Share-Alike is fantastic if you want to go down the path of promoting yourself. It gives you a wider audience by making it easier for people to share and reuse your work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicky looks forward to releasing more work under Creative Commons licensing in the future. She is currently working on a website where users can download free graphics and wallpapers. She is planning to release themes for a small fee, also using Creative Commons licensing. She is considering Creative Commons licensing for her other projects, including a compilation of a web-comic and a series of Vlogs.&lt;/p&gt;

Common across Youtube, videos shot vertically have two black bands of empty space framing the video, as you can see the screenshot, below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vertical Video Syndrome quickly went viral, picking up over  three million views on Youtube. Noticing the popularity of the video, &lt;a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/seftms/about/staff/miriam-ross" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Ross&lt;/a&gt;—an academic and filmmaker based in Wellington, New Zealand—decided to respond. With research assistant Maddy Glen, Miriam produced the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buHSJitp46w" target="_blank"&gt;Vertical Cinema Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that Vertical Cinema was, in fact, a legitimate cinematic form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img&gt; Screenshot from "The Vertical Cinema Manifesto," by the Vertical Feminist Collective, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buHSJitp46w" target="_blank"&gt;via Youtube&lt;/a&gt;. Made available under a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution licence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Miriam explains, “The ‘Vertical Video Syndrome was very humorous, but when you see it getting circulated online, it’s used as a form of policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to get away from that. We wanted to say, we have all these new tools, let’s see what can happen. It’s all very experimental. Hopefully the manifesto is a celebration of what can be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was a close parody of the Vertical Cinema Syndrome. Replete with quotes from feminist film scholar &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Mulvey" target="_blank"&gt;Laura Mulvey&lt;/a&gt;, the film closes with six recommendations, the forth of which reads, "A Creative Commons licence must be used."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideas around the manifesto tied into an honours film course Miriam was teaching at the time, on DIY filmmaking. “That paper framed the project. Part of that is trying to move away from the hierarchies around filmmaking--the idea that there’s a ‘best way’ to make films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were looking at how people use the technology they have in their hands to make films with no budget or resources. Obviously, with DIY filmmaking the Creative Commons licences became very interesting. It tied into both the courses I teach and our project. Because we’ve got no money, we’ve been wanting to find material we can use for free. But we also want to take part in this Creative Commons culture that’s going round now, where people are licensing their work for free.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miriam is also interested in how DIY filmmakers remix and reuse other cultural works. As she points out, “There’s a lot of debate now, because video essays are becoming more popular. Film academics who are using video clips, and sometimes using voiceover to narrate the clips, and that’s could come up against copyright.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Miriam points out, one of the problems is that New Zealand lacks the broad Fair Use allowances enjoyed in the US. Even the Vertical Cinema Manifesto itself, which uses small parts of several copyright films, could occupy a grey area, despite &lt;a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345961.html" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand’s Fair Dealing exceptions for criticism and review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is tricky. One of the things I teach in my course is mashups and video remixes. They are a huge part of our contemporary culture, and they’re all operating in this grey area. It’s strange because the companies, especially film companies, want their films talked about. The mashups are often a form of advertising for them, but they still aren’t promoting this sort of use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, Miriam and Maddy produced Heaven, a short ‘vertical’ film currently under consideration for film festivals. “It’s an exploration of what we can do with very little resources and money, using new technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film, like the Manifesto itself, was made collaboratively with friends and colleagues, and will carry a Creative Commons licence when released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s what’s great about Creative Commons. It encourages people to take something and just see what they can do with it. That’s the kind of spirit I want to see more of. Instead of trying to be an auteur starting from scratch to make something unique and singular, why not build on what other people are doing to create something that’s maybe more hybrid, but maybe more exciting as a result.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Case Studies</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Culture</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2013/05/22/vertical-cinema.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 01:22:16 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
