&lt;p&gt;Academic research works by explicitly free sharing of information, and any friction introduced into the process decreases its efficiency, in turn reducing the return on investment we make into any kind of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a sophisticated position on the harmonisation on the various reuse provisions “Fair Dealing” and “Fair Use” within the TPPA actors. As librarians we are expected to have a clear understanding on practical issues around this, and the current situation means we are unable to offer advice and guidance for the medium term. It is not just uncomfortable for us personally; it could lead to a position of liability for our organisations as we make research outputs available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As librarians we are the sharp end of the balance between providing adequate protection for copyright holders to exploit their creations, and access to research to our community, and the wider academic world for material that they have paid for through taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am concerned that there will be more corporate interference in access to publicly paid-for research, just as business models are starting to change to an Open Access model where organisations sponsor and patronise profit and not-for-profit businesses to provide publishing platforms for research analysis and data. Corporate organisations have a responsibility to provide a maximum return for their shareholders, but not at the cost of reducing access to tax-payer funded research. Library budgets are at such low levels that they cannot afford to purchase the research outputs of record their own organisation has funded in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one element of the friction against efficient research I was talking about above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue is not one of established objective regulation, but the chilling effect of extended copyright provisions has on sharing research in the minds of researchers themselves. Copyright is not well understood by researchers, even with the best efforts of librarians and records offices. It is a tangential field to research proper, part of the game of scholarly publishing. As (mostly media) businesses protect their output more and more closely, to the point of employing third party bounty hunters to find infringements to prosecute, researchers become more concerned about protecting their property, to the point of being overly sensitive. This adds yet more friction to research efficiency for no reason other than fear of breaking some misunderstood rule. “Because copyright” has become the standard response for a number of perverse behaviours, including supervisors recommending to students to hide their postgraduate research for a number of years, not to make work available on institutional repositories even though it is legitimate to do so, and stifle sharing and collaboration between institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring strong provisions for Fair Dealing are fundamental to be able to criticise, review and expand on previous work. Any uncertainty on the ability to do so is not just a blow to the high minded ideals of academic freedom, but a sheet anchor on research and innovation in a very practical sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good response to these concerns is a policy change for all NZ funded research to be mandated to be published immediately as Open Access. This would create a level, clear and unambiguous regulatory platform which would remove fear, uncertainty and doubt over access to publicly funded research. In some cases extra funding for research institutions would be required to sponsor commercial platforms, but the reduction in the price of subscriptions through libraries would offset that to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model has been developed and is operating in the UK, and for all state funded research over a certain amount in the US. NZ will be at a considerable disadvantage if it does not follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Where do you think Open Access is in Aotearoa? How far have we come?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“We've actually come a long way. If I look where we were when Creative Commons Aotearoa first joined the Royal Society, people in the research office had not heard of Open Access. It was seen as a radical idea then. We've come from not knowing what it was, to four NZ universities actually institutionalising positions on Open Access. We have Open Access weeks every year now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“So, you have to celebrate the progress of New Zealand. But if you step outside of New Zealand, we're really behind. The main concern for me is that we lack a commitment from research funders to put conditions on grants requiring researchers to share. This isn't just public funders – even private funders need to be moving in this direction. If you look overseas, funders like the National Institute for Health (NIH) have had mandates for years. Even private organisations like the Bill Gates Foundation now have these sorts of mandates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“When the NIH decided to have the OA mandate, they also put in place PubMedCentral. They provided the repository. Only now are the universities really exploiting the possibilities of the institutional repositories that libraries offer. It's very difficult to say that you need to publish Open Access when you do not give authors the option of going the green OA route. Some of the more prestigious journals do have Article Processing Charges – most don't, but many do. So it's understandable that the repositories are a big part of the solution. Without those repositories, it's hard to implement OA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“In that sense, I think we are lagging behind. The one place where we are doing better is with open government data. New Zealand is operating in a slightly different order to the rest of the world, because they managed to get the government data mandate put in place quite well. I would like to see the same requirements pushed to funding research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“It shouldn't be that hard. We just need these organisations to say, 'if you want my money, here are the conditions'. Are researchers going to turn down that money? The funders are the ones that have the power. I think there is enough awareness that the fears that have held funders back are less than they were when the open access conversation started.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We have four Open Access commitments from universities. They are not as strong as they could be, but they are a start. But there haven't been any strong open data mandates. What's the future of open research data?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“With research data, you run into a slightly bigger problem. Universities have not figured out exactly what a good data management plan looks like, let alone the structure and resources we need to put behind the implementation of a good data management plan. So you can say, 'make your data available' – and there are solutions, like Figshare – but the institutions and the funders would like to see some wider national links, so they can be sure of the implementation of open data mandates. Australia has this, with ANDS. We don't have that in New Zealand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“So it isn't surprising that a mandate on data isn't something that we've had a mature conversation about so far. We haven't seen as many international examples of open research data mandates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“However, we are seeing many reputable journals like PeerJ requiring data sharing. As more journals require this, the requirement for better data management will come. It's very difficult to ask someone to share their data when it wasn't produced in such a way that makes it ready to publish. Open data requires a lot of behavioural change in the way we do science. We need to keep pushing for open data, though be aware that it will take some time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;We need more examples of researchers like yourself successfully releasing their data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“I spend a lot of time on my data. I want to know that I'm not wasting my time. If I'm losing or destroying my data, and not releasing it for reuse, then from an institutional perspective, I have to ask: why are you hiring me? You wouldn't go to any other sector and say, let's get rid of all the work that was done five years ago. This work is part of our heritage, our historical record.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“A lot of the projects that I have are based on work that was done 20 years ago. Back then, there wasn't the technology to explore those questions further. I need access to that 20-year-old data. It's very hard to predict where data might end up having an impact. Destroying the data is a way of saying: my work is meant to have no impact. And then you think, how much money was spent on that project, how many people worked on it? And then you weigh those costs against the cost of storing the data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“We were talking to Cable Green today, the Global Manager for Education at Creative Commons, and he said that all public grants should have a 10% allocation for implementation. We should have that in the research sector. Not for implementation, but for preservation. If you're not willing to give up 10% to preserve the work you do produce, then what you're saying is, I want your money for something that is not actually worth researching. If it's not worth preserving, then it's not worth doing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;You'd think that this argument would be one that researchers would have difficulty disagreeing with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“There are other incentives. To get and keep a job, you need to play a certain game within the research system, and with the people you are assessing your performance. This is why you need to have the discussion with the university and with the funders. The government, too, has enormous power to say to the research community: here is what New Zealand values in research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“One of the problems here is that most of the decision-makers come from the non-digital age, like me. To them, the potential of the internet is not as obvious as it is to younger researchers. We don't necessarily understand what the internet offers.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;There's been a lot of activity over the years across New Zealand by a community of various advocates – from workshops and events to the passage of institutional policies. What's the most effective way forward for this community of people in support of OA, given that these people are often not in a position to push through change in their institution?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“This is a good question: Is there a limit to who you can reach? When I talk to colleagues in the United States, they all deposit in PubMedCentral. They consider it so fundamental a part of the process, that it's no longer something that they have to think about. Our conversations are about values, and not conversations about everyday work. In New Zealand, we've often made the argument that this is the right thing to do. Its publicly funded, and the public should have access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“Well, a lot of people don't agree with that. For some of us, this is an ethical position that we take, based on one ethical model. But perhaps for other people, with different values, we need to frame the issue in a different way. What is it that they care about, and how can OA help solve their problems? Maybe we need to change the conversation to match the motivations of those who do not buy in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“The grassroots movement supports the democratisation of knowledge. But that movement will have a limit. The question is: where's the value proposition that will get the others on board. The grassroots should continue to do as much as we can. But we should think about other ways to frame the issue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;A lot of researchers also don't have a strong position either way. Is it that they just want this problem to solved for them at a government, funder or institutional level?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“A lot of academics don't see access as a problem. They can get access to anything they want to read, because of their institution. And from the point of view of some academics, the people who need to read their research already have access.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“The question is not access, then, but how broad the access should be. For me, it should be universal. But others do not feel that you would be able to read and interpret their articles in any knowledgeable way, and therefore you should be fine with a press release. The argument is essentially this: you can't understand my article, therefore you should not have access to my article, therefore you will never understand my article. Stay ignorant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“I like to think we can build a better society where we say: society pays me via the university and research grants. The person on the street is paying my salary. I like to think you have a right to ask me to explain why I'm doing this research, and why this money should be given to me. I should be held accountable. Maybe if we had more Open Access papers that were better written, we could even use them in secondary schools. Maybe this can lead to greater collaboration with teaching in schools. There is a potential for collaboration that is not exploited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“With the internet, too, young people will find information. It's up to researchers to decide whether that information is correct or not. I shouldn't spend my time writing blog posts. In my ideal world, there are no scientist bloggers, because there's no need for them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;What about their students? They are training all these students, often to a postgraduate level, who will not have access to research when they graduate. There are more former students, with decent literacy and expertise in their discipline, than there are academics and researchers with library subscriptions by a factor of a thousand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“But what they say then is: just email me, and I'll give it to you. They consider their audience small enough to be managed by email. It's not understanding how big their audience is – and also how serendipitous discovery is. So, yes: my article might not be read by anyone. But if everyone publishes openly, then the probability of finding something useful increases exponentially. You never get more readership by diminishing distribution.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Can I put my article on ResearchGate?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I want to put a conference paper in our institution's research repository, can I do that?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These -- among others -- are questions I frequently get these days from university staff and students, usually followed by "but I'm not sure about copyright". Like so many copyright questions, the answer is "it depends".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;strong&gt;if you don't actually copy anything, copyright doesn't come into it&lt;/strong&gt;. If your work was already published somewhere, like a journal's website, then just link to it. ResearchGate, for example, makes this simple for you by asking for a few search terms and then pointing to the source, meaning you don't upload anything. The less you copy and instead point people to a single source, the easier it is for you to track how many people are reading your work. Perhaps more importantly, a journal or your institutional repository will have a stable link that won't die because someone changed the way they structure their website. The only problem with linking is if your work is behind a paywall that blocks anyone who doesn't work for an institution with the relevant subscription, like government policy makers, businesses, schools, lots of other tertiary institutions, the general public, etc. More on that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If linking isn't an option, then ask yourself whether you are the copyright holder. The default in most cases is: &lt;strong&gt;if you created it, you own the copyright&lt;/strong&gt;, whether it's a research paper, a photo you took on holiday or your shopping list. And if you own the copyright, that means you have the right to copy, share, adapt, or communicate the work. So, yes, if you own the copyright, it's fine to put it wherever you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One caveat is that an employer or someone who commissioned a work will own work by default, though this can be varied by contract; in most universities the employer will have a policy that leaves copyright in the hands of researchers (&lt;a href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/administration/policies/otago003229.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;as is the case&lt;/a&gt; where I work). The other main reason you might not have copyright is that you assigned it to someone else in a contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime you publish, there'll be an agreement you sign that is a formal contract setting out your rights and theirs. Trouble is, for most of us these agreements are written by lawyers and are not really suitable for human consumption. Next time you get one of these, look for these key terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;"transfer" or "assign" copyright -- this means you're giving your copyright to the publisher&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;"licence" -- in some contracts you keep copyright but provide the publisher with a licence (i.e. permission to publish), which is actually all they need to publish the work, the terms of which will include things like the points that follow;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;"exclusive" vs "non-exclusive" -- you only ever want to grant a non-exclusive licence so that you retain the right to put your work where you want to&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;"irrevocabale" means the terms will apply for all eternity&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;"self-archiving," "archival deposit" or similar -- some contracts now specifically allow you to deposit a version in an institutional repository (usually this version is either the submitted version or the accepted version post-peer review, not the final 'version of record' that appears in the journal)&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;"open access" -- this is a hot topic in academic publishing; the specific terms will vary but most commonly you will retain the copyright and the open access licence that is applied allows anyone, including the publisher, to copy the work under certain terms.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as I said above, if you own the copyright (and you didn't grant an exclusive licence), you can put your work in ResearchGate, in a repository, on a blog, on a departmental web page or give it to students, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you get a contract that seems to be giving up all your rights, there are plenty of resources that can &lt;a href="http://www.sparc.arl.org/resources/authors/addendum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;help you claim some of them back&lt;/a&gt;. It's your work after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every book has a job to do. For many books, that job is to make money for its creators. But a lot of books have other jobs to do. Sometimes the fact that people pay for books helps that job, but other times the book would be able to do its job better if it were free for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why Creative Commons (CC) licensing is so important. But while CC addresses the licensing problem nicely, free ebooks face many challenges that make it difficult for them to do their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;i&gt;Oral Literature in Africa&lt;/i&gt; was first published in 1970, its number one job was to earn tenure for the author, a rising academic. It succeeded, and then some. The book became a classic, elevating an obscure topic and creating an entire field of scholarly inquiry in cultural anthropology. But in 2012, it was failing to do any job at all. The book was out of print and unavailable to young scholars on the very continent whose culture it documented. Ruth Finnegan, the author, considered it her life's work and hoped it would continue to stimulate original research and new insights. To accomplish that, the book needed to be free. It needed to be translatable, it needed to be extendable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/OralLiteratureInAfrica.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-483" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/OralLiteratureInAfrica-199x300.jpg" alt="Licensed CC BY" width="199" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensed CC BY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ngā Reanga Youth Development: Māori Styles&lt;/i&gt;, an Open Access book by Josie Keelan from &lt;a title="EPress: Open Access publishing at UniTec" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/epress-open-access-publishing-unitec/" target="_blank"&gt;ePress&lt;/a&gt;, is another example of an academic book with important jobs to do. While its primary job is a local one -- the advancement of understanding and practice in Māori youth development -- it has another job, a global one. Being free helps it speak to scholars and researchers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NgaReanga.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-484" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/NgaReanga.jpg" alt="Licensed CC BY-SA" width="134" height="187"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensed CC BY-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leanne Brown's &lt;i&gt;Good and Cheap&lt;/i&gt; is a very different book. It's a cookbook. But the job she wanted it to do made it more than your usual cookbook. She wanted to improve the lives of people who receive "nutrition assistance" (eg. food stamps) by providing recipes for nutritious and healthy meals that can be made without spending much money. By being free, &lt;i&gt;Good and Cheap&lt;/i&gt; helps more people in need eat well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GoodAndCheap.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-485" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GoodAndCheap-300x298.jpg" alt="Licensed CC BY-NC-SA" width="300" height="298"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensed CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My last example is Casey Fiesler's &lt;i&gt;Barbie You can be a Computer Engineer Remixed, Now With Less Sexism&lt;/i&gt;. The job of this book is to poke fun at the original &lt;i&gt;Barbie You can be a Computer Engineer&lt;/i&gt;, in which Barbie needs boys to do the actual computer coding. But because Feisler uses material from the original under "fair use", anything other than free, non-commercial distribution isn't legal. Barbie remixed can ONLY be a free ebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a problem with free ebooks. The book industry runs on a highly evolved and optimised cradle-to-grave supply chain, comprising publishers, printers, production houses, distributors, wholesalers, retailers, aggregators, libraries, publicists, developers, cataloguers, database suppliers, reviewers, used-book dealers, even pulpers. And each entity in this supply chain takes a percentage. The entire chain stops functioning when an ebook is free. Even libraries (most of them) lack the processes that would enable them to include free ebooks in their collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a title="Unglue.it" href="https://unglue.it/landing/" target="_blank"&gt;Unglue.it&lt;/a&gt;, we ran smack into this problem when we set out to bring books into the commons. We helped &lt;a title="Open Book Publishers" href="http://www.openbookpublishers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Book Publishers&lt;/a&gt; crowdfund a new ebook edition of &lt;i&gt;Oral Literature in Africa&lt;/i&gt;. The ebook was freely available, but it wasn't easy to make it free on Amazon, which dominates the ebook market. We couldn't get the big ebook aggregators that serve libraries to add it to their platforms. We realised that someone had to do the work that the supply chain didn't want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we've worked to turn Unglue.it into a "bookstore for free books". The transformation isn't done yet, but we've built a database of over 1,200 downloadable ebooks, licensed under Creative Commons or other free licenses. We have a long way to go, but we're distributing over 10,000 ebooks per month. We're providing syndication feeds, developing relationships with distributors, improving metadata, and promoting wonderful books that happen to be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators of these books still need to find support. To help them, we've developed three revenue programs. For books that already have free licences, we help the creators ask for financial support in the one place where readers are most appreciative of their work -- inside the books themselves. We call this "thanks for ungluing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For books that exist as ebooks but need to recoup production costs, we offer "buy-to-unglue". We'll sell these books until they reach a revenue target, after which they'll become Open Access. For books that exist in print but need funding for conversion to Open Access ebook, we offer "pledge-to-unglue", which is a way of crowdfunding the conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a book has finished its job, it can look forward to a lengthy retirement. There's no need for books to die anymore, but we can help them enjoy retirement, and maybe even enjoy a second life. Project Gutenberg has over 50,000 books that have "retired" into the public domain. We're starting to think about the care these books need. Formats change along with the people that use them, and the book industry's supply chain does its best to turn them back into money-earners to pay for that care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently we received a grant from the Knight Foundation to work on ways to provide the long-term care that these books need to be productive AND free in their retirements. GITenberg, a collaboration between the folks at Unglue.it and ebook technologist Seth Woodward, is exploring the use of Github for free ebook maintenance. Github is a website that supports collaborative software development with source control and workflow tools. Our hope is that the ingredients that have made Github wildly successful in the open source software world will will prove to be similarly effective in supporting ebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't so long ago that printing costs made free ebooks impossible. So it's no wonder that free ebooks haven't realised their full potential. But with cooperation and collaboration, we can really make wonderful things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Editor-in-Chief Evangelia Papoutsaki and Editorial Assistant Louise Saunders of &lt;a title="ePress" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/" target="_blank"&gt;ePress&lt;/a&gt;, an Open Access scholarly publishing house at Unitec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did your Open Access philosophy develop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global political economy is one of the key barriers to human social progress. Information should be free like the air we breathe and not a market commodity with a profit attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ePress we believe that knowledge should be accessible to all. Academics are paid by taxpayers to research and produce knowledge, and the idea that students and the general public must pay for that knowledge does not sit well with us. It should be available to anyone who has the desire to read and use it. Citizens have the right to learn; access to information and knowledge should not be through their wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Theses-Review-Series-Cover-Large.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-481" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Theses-Review-Series-Cover-Large-212x300.jpg" alt="Book cover designed for ePress by Penny Thomson.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did ePress come to be set up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPress is an online, quality-assured, in-house publisher for authors and researchers working at, or associated with, Unitec Institute of Technology. As well as there being research produced at Unitec that needed a publishing home, there were other outputs such as performances, mixed media, design and art installations that all had potential as non-traditional publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of ePress emerged out of a desire to harness the publishing potential of all these outputs by providing a platform from which they could be shared. Launched in late 2011, ePress started off with the more traditional conference proceedings and reports, and quickly grew to embrace eMedia and books. In 2014 ePress really hit its stride with the publication of two books (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Press, Politics and People in Papua New Guinea 1950-1975" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/press-politics-and-people-in-papua-new-guinea-1950-1975/" target="_blank"&gt;Press, Politics and People in Papua New Guinea 1950-1975&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Philip Cass and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Ngā Reanga Youth Development Māori Styles" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/nga-reanga-youth-development-maori-styles-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Ngā Reanga Youth Development Māori Styles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Josie Keelan), an edited collection (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Communication Issues in Aotearoa New Zealand" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/communication-issues-in-aotearoa-new-zealand-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Communication Issues in Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; edited by Giles Dodson and Evangelia Papoutsaki), two wonderful eMedia (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Rosebank: Cabbages, Horses and Science" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/rosebank-cabbages-horses-and-science/" target="_blank"&gt;Rosebank: Cabbages, Horses and Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Paul Woodruffe and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="The Moveable Feast Collective Teach Design" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/the-moveable-feast-collective-teach-design-2/" target="_blank"&gt;The Moveable Feast Collective Teach Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Susan Jowsey) as well publishing conference proceedings for the 31st Annual Society of Architectural Historians Australia and New Zealand (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Translation" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/translation/" target="_blank"&gt;Translation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;edited by Christoph Schnoor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2015 ePress unveiled new layouts and cover art for our regular series; launched a new series titled &lt;i&gt;Perspectives in Biosecurity Research Series&lt;/i&gt; edited by Dan Blanchon and Mel Galbraith; and announced the production of a forthcoming collection titled &lt;i&gt;Conceptual Works in Sports Studies&lt;/i&gt; and edited by Lesley Ferkins and Mieke Sieuw. It’s going to be a big year at ePress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed any changes over time in the academic perception of Open Access scholarly publishing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. The perception used to be very much one of scholarly snobbery. If you weren’t in the right journal, or published to certain standards, it was of no merit to academia. However, things are changing, and fast. The methods for producing knowledge are changing and so too should our method of dissemination. More and more scholars are accepting and embracing the idea that there are other ways to prepare, produce and disseminate information. EPress has a strong focus on eMedia publications and they are a great example of alternative ways to share that knowledge. With these methods have come new researchers, authors and producers who believe that Open Access is the way forward for them. This new way of thinking is producing some truly fun and unique publications that might not have found a home anywhere else. More traditional publishers would not have been able to control their distribution and make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has been your experience of publishing with a Creative Commons licence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When authors submit to ePress we explain our processes and the Creative Commons licensing system. We automatically assign new publications with the Attribution-NonCommercial licence and give the authors time to investigate the other licences, should they wish to change. The response to the licensing, and the one we auto-select for them, has been well received by all of our authors. For those who are new to Creative Commons, they have really embraced the goals of Open Access publishing – though they are publishing with ePress so to an extent they are probably Open Access supporters already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far at academic institutions, promoting Open Access has been seen primarily as a library concern, and reporting for the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) primarily as being in the realm of the research office. But by working together there are a number of ways that Open Access and PBRF reporting can benefit each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits of Open Access to the PBRF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious benefit for the institution is the &lt;a title="SPARC" href="http://sparceurope.org/oaca/" target="_blank"&gt;well-known citation advantage&lt;/a&gt; for papers available by either gold Open Access ("born" Open Access) or green Open Access (a version of the canonical toll-access paper is deposited in an OA repository). To the extent that PBRF scores depend on institutions being able to demonstrate the impact of their research, this citation advantage is worth money. Likewise, Open Access publications can raise the profile of early career researchers especially, opening up opportunities for national and international collaboration -- another factor that can demonstrate peer esteem for the researcher as PBRF portfolios are assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benefit to the PBRF process comes when considering the arduous tasks of output verification (within the institution) and auditing (at the national level). Verification is a painfully manual process of searching for each output to obtain evidence of its existence -- an official pdf from the publisher's website is preferred -- and confirm citation details. A well-established history of indexing makes citations for most journal articles fairly trivial to locate. But for disciplines where books and chapters are more common, or for researchers whose portfolios rely on conference papers, even tracking down the citation details can be an involved process -- or impossible, several years after a conference has removed them from its website. If these outputs were available Open Access, they would be far more quickly found, and untold hours of valuable staff time saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/researchlock.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-96" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/researchlock-300x222.png" alt="researchlock" width="300" height="222"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits of the PBRF to Open Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With this vast investment of staff hours in mind, many institutions attempt to merge the processes of verifying outputs for the PBRF and filling the institutional repository (IR). This might be done by manually forwarding metadata with located pdf fulltext to IR staff, or by an integrated system gathering and sharing metadata and fulltext in common. Provided author permission can be obtained, &lt;a title="Sherpa" href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/" target="_blank"&gt;publisher policies are amenable&lt;/a&gt;, and/or an institutional mandate applies, this can be very successful at increasing the amount of literature available Open Access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are limitations. Metadata requirements differ for the different purposes. Worse, PBRF verification typically requires the published version of a paper, which copyright generally precludes the institutional repository from reproducing; whereas the institutional repository will often need an author's version, which is useless for verification purposes. One blunt solution can be to encourage researchers to submit all versions of their paper, and let support staff sort out which ones are needed where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing all the benefits that Open Access provides for PBRF reporting and the resulting funding can make it easier to advocate for researcher and management support of Open Access initiatives. These might include advising researchers of high-impact Open Access journals in their fields that they could be publishing in; supporting the costs of Article Processing Charnges (APC) where other funding is unavailable; or even &lt;a title="Harvard" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies" target="_blank"&gt;implementing an Open Access mandate across the institution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboration between the library and research office -- and, if implementing a new system, IT services -- isn't trivial. Like a three-legged stool, all need to be equal partners, communicating and appreciating the quite different languages, cultures and priorities of each team. But then it opens up scope for future collaboration when we come to look at other mutually beneficial issues like research data and funding grants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Access (OA) has never been hotter. New funding has become available from the &lt;a href="http://www.mellon.org/grants/grants-database/advanced-search/?p=114&amp;amp;amount-low=&amp;amp;amount-high=&amp;amp;year-start=&amp;amp;year-end=&amp;amp;city=&amp;amp;state=&amp;amp;country=&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;per_page=25"&gt;Mellon Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (totalling $6 million) for innovative digital humanities projects -- some explicitly for OA, others with OA implicit in the project structure. University &lt;a href="http://www.luminosoa.org/"&gt;presses&lt;/a&gt; are launching their own OA publishing programmes. In January 2015, Geoffrey Crossick published his much-anticipated &lt;a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/pubs/indirreports/2015/monographsandopenaccess/2014_monographs.pdf"&gt;report to HEFCE&lt;/a&gt; on monographs and OA. Mandates for OA publishing are &lt;a href="http://roarmap.eprints.org/"&gt;increasing globally&lt;/a&gt;. And of course, the &lt;a href="http://collections.knowledgeunlatched.org/downloads/"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; of our own Knowledge Unlatched Pilot project were recently published, highlighting the success with which libraries and publishers can work together to create sustainable routes to OA for scholarly books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialist scholarly books, including monographs, allow researchers to present their work, pose questions and to test and extend areas of theory through long-form writing. In spite of the fact that research communities all over the world value monographs and depend heavily on them as a requirement of tenure and promotion in many disciplines, sales of this kind of book are in free fall, with some estimates suggesting declines of as much as 90% over 20 years (Willinsky 2006). Cash-strapped monograph publishers have found themselves caught in a negative cycle of increasing prices and falling sales, with few resources left to support experimentation, business model innovation or engagement with digital technology and OA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to textbooks, which provide a broad overview of a field and are intended for a student audience, monographs present primary research and original scholarship, and their intended audience is generally other researchers. Having a book-length work published by a recognised scholarly press is understood as an important intellectual achievement (Adema &amp;amp; Ferwerda 2014) and the publication of a monograph serves as evidence of professional competence and is a requirement for tenure and promotion in many disciplines (Crow 2012; Williams et al. 2009).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of their importance as a textual form through which new knowledge in the Humanities and Social Sciences is developed, certified and communicated among research communities across the globe, very few readers beyond the walls of the university are able to access these kinds of books. Books have been slower than journals to make a shift to digital formats (Adema 2010) and monographs are often available only in hardback. They are generally published in short print runs and their biggest market is university libraries in the United States and Western Europe, which pay between $50 and $250 per copy (Gasson 2004; Steele 2008). There is widespread consensus that sales of monographs are in decline: 20 years ago it was normal for monographs to sell several thousand copies and today, most will sell just a few hundred (Wasserman 1998; Bunz 2014; Williams et al. 2009). At a moment when new technologies should be lowering barriers to access, monographs remain both closed and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knowledge Unlatched Pilot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Unlatched (KU) was established as a not-for-profit company in 2012 with the goal of enabling a more effective monograph ecosystem. During the 2013--14 Knowledge Unlatched Pilot, publishers were invited to offer new titles to library communities on a novel basis: agreeing to make them OA immediately upon publication in return for a Title Fee paid by a consortium of libraries. Libraries from all over the world were invited to join together to share the costs of the Title Fee, securing access not just for their own users, but also for readers everywhere. Because the Title Fee was a fixed amount, the more libraries agreed to take part in the programme, the lower the cost became for each library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Christina-Emery-Photo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-470" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Christina-Emery-Photo-289x300.jpg" alt="Christina Emery of Knowledge Unlatched. Copyright Taya Uddin Photography" width="289" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Christina Emery of Knowledge Unlatched. Copyright Taya Uddin Photography&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KU team set out to enable positive change in a complex publishing ecosystem. We believed that developing coordinating infrastructure that built on the global nature of scholarly communication and the network effects of OA could help markets for specialist scholarly books to function more effectively. Creating conditions that encourage publishers to incorporate OA into their business models and providing libraries with an opportunity to maximise the positive impact of spending on books were key goals of the project. As such, the KU Proof-of-Concept Pilot deliberately involved monograph stakeholders from across the ecosystem: research funders, authors, publishers, digital intermediaries, libraries and readers all played a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2013 libraries from around the world were invited to pledge a maximum of $1,680 towards securing OA for 28 new Humanities and Social Science research titles from 13 recognised scholarly publishers. If at least 200 libraries agreed to contribute towards the cost of the collection, publishers would be paid a Title Fee in return for making the books available on Creative Commons licences as soon as was practicable once the books had been published (without an embargo). If fewer than 200 libraries joined, the books would still be published, but they would remain closed. The Pilot was an unqualified success: 297 libraries from 24 countries pledged their support for the collection, exceeding the original 200-library target by almost 50%. This reduced the cost for every participating library from $1,680 to $1,195. Libraries paid less than $43 to unlatch each book, compared to an average cover price of $95. Participating publishers received an average Title Fee payment of $12,000 for each of the books, minus any deductions made in recognition of additional copies purchased by libraries. In the collection’s first 24 weeks online, 12,763 downloads from 138 countries were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LucyMontgomery2-940x1253.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-471" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/LucyMontgomery2-940x1253-225x300.jpg" alt="Lucy Montgomery of Curtin University.

&lt;p&gt;The 2013--14 KU Pilot established that authors, librarians, publishers and research funders can work together to support OA for book-length scholarly publications, and that doing so lowers the cost of securing access for libraries and helps publishers to manage the risks associated with publishing monographs. It also demonstrated demand among libraries for cost-effective opportunities to support OA for books, as well as publisher appetite for market-based alternatives to author-side OA publishing fees. Usage data from the Pilot Collection is already providing insight into the truly global impact of the project and the capacity of libraries to enable access for readers located far beyond their own institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the limited scope of the Pilot necessarily left some important issues unresolved. Additional investment will be required to enable the project to be scaled and expanded. More work will need to be done to ensure that KU represents a practical option for librarians struggling to manage complex supply chains and workflows; questions about how KU might be shaped in order to enable diversity in the scholarly book landscape are yet to be addressed; further study is needed in order to explore the issues around multiple format charging; and more work is needed in order to understand how the KU model might fit with the value propositions and workflows of ‘pure OA’ publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;The future?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is becoming increasingly evident that in order to tackle the challenges of scholarly publishing, various business models are needed to overcome these wide-ranging hurdles, meaning that each stakeholder will need to be flexible as different processes run concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes taking the next steps imperative. Fortunately we can get there in cost-effective and sustainable ways. As &lt;a href="http://blog.hefce.ac.uk/2015/01/22/thinking-about-monographs-in-a-world-of-open-access/"&gt;Crossick&lt;/a&gt; says, ‘the direction of travel’ to OA is clear. Just how long that journey might be and how many pathways need to be hacked through the jungle may not be known today, but the prize is within sight. Monographs, the foundational works in so many subject areas, have an exciting future as they become ever more widely available to people all around the world through Open Access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Knowledge Unlatched is seeing the advantages of opening up access to books: there were over 23,000 downloads of the 28 titles in the Pilot Collection in at least 154 countries since mid-March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the manager of an Institutional Repository, one of my regular tasks is to tell enquirers why they can’t download a PDF that they have found with Google from our collection. The work is there, but we have had to embargo it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s becoming more common for us to embargo work. There are a multitude of reasons why we do so that, when put together, give a view into the process of scholarly publishing from economic, personal and professional perspectives. But are academic publishing embargoes just delaying the inevitable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold two main types of work. The first type is theses, dissertations and research reports: things that have been created for a qualification. I’m dead impressed with anyone who has finished a thesis -- it’s a masterpiece in the old sense -- the work you need to have done to call yourself a master in your trade, signalling the end of your apprenticeship. Even the 4th-year student work that departments submit is good stuff, on a huge range of topics from fire engineering (&lt;a title="couch burning" href="http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/8545" target="_blank"&gt;this guy got a degree by burning couches&lt;/a&gt;) to history. The other sort of work we collect is research outputs by staff and students: mostly manuscript, final versions of journal articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone want to delay public access to this work? With anything as complex as research there are always going to be a few individual circumstances that are not easily put into categories, but the main ones are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Shyness&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thesis can be the first time someone writes for a public audience. All through an academic career you write, it gets read by one or two people, and that’s it. Filed, or thrown away. For some great work, this is a terrible shame, which is why we accept all sorts of student work, as long as the quality is assured. Nonetheless, people are nervous about their work, and simple self-effacement can lead students to embargo their work for as long as possible. Our response is that if your work passed, and you were credited with the qualification, then you should be proud of your work, not embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Concerns about plagiarism&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theses are great resources for researchers -- I’ve written about this before -- just the literature review or the bibliography is a great primer in a field. The ideas in the thesis can’t be protected though, and authors are worried that they might get stolen. The answer to this is simple: if you don’t put up a version of record, you can’t establish your primacy in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Publishers won’t publish me if the same data is in my thesis&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by far the most common reason for embargoes on theses. I wish I had some more-than-anecdotal evidence that this was true. Some research has been done in the social sciences, and has shown that a publishable book is a very different thing to a thesis (Ramirez et al, 2012). Even then, having an Open Access electronic version of a scholarly monograph has also been shown to increase the sales of print copies of exactly the same thing! I’m not aware of similar research done in STEM, but the speed of scientific publishing is such that papers are now normally lined up before the thesis has even been submitted for marking. If readers have evidence of this, I’d really like to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;I have a contractual obligation to embargo this work&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For journal articles, having an embargo on the version in the repository is often demanded by publishers. Repositories form a very potent threat to the traditional toll-based publishers -- why would you pay millions of dollars in subscriptions to journals if the same work was available for free? Embargoes are one of the contractual tools publishers use to fight the creeping advance of Open Access, along with many other stipulations designed to make an repository version of an article as unappealing as possible. When the US government demanded that publicly funded federal research be openly accessible, the stoush about embargo lengths (publishers demanded 2 years, and were fought down to 12 months) was protracted and bitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What authors don’t realise is that they have all the power. Once the paper has been accepted, all contractual agreements are up for grabs -- obviously the journal wants the paper, it will sell more subscriptions. So why would an author want to make a fuss and reduce the embargo? Because they will get more citations for their work, which is how you win at the current academic game. A lot of recent work now confirms a considerable advantage for papers that are published Open Access, and early. I won’t cite specific papers, but point you to a &lt;a title="SPARC Europe" href="http://sparceurope.org/oaca/" target="_blank"&gt;website dedicated to this&lt;/a&gt;, as new work is occurring constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, there are few good reasons to embargo your research (though there will always be exceptions). Publishing early, and with a license that allows your work to find its fullest audience, is the best use of the resource that has gone into your research, and will pay you the best reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conferences are where a huge amount of research gets its first public airing. And yet conference papers are notoriously hard to track down after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some conferences still publish their proceedings in print monographs; some on CD, DVD, or USB stick; an increasing number in special issues of journals. Some publish them on websites that may or may not last beyond the year. Access may be limited to attendees or to database subscribers. Many don't publish at all, leaving it up to the author to remember and find the time to self-deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the Open Access movement has paid remarkably little attention to the potential of conference outputs. OpCit's open access citation advantage bibliography (now &lt;a href="http://sparceurope.org/oaca/"&gt;maintained by SPARC Europe&lt;/a&gt;) includes 32 papers sourced from conferences -- but only two &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; conferences. The Public Knowledge Project's conferences are full to the brim with papers about the use of Open Journal System (OJS), but not even every year do they have a single paper about &lt;a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/"&gt;Open Conference System&lt;/a&gt; (OCS). At least they make &lt;a href="http://ocs.sfu.ca/pkp/index.php"&gt;these papers Open Access&lt;/a&gt;, though. Many Open Access conferences don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/conference.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-462" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/conference-300x225.png" alt="Conference from OpenClipArt " width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Conference from &lt;a title="OpenClipArt" href="https://openclipart.org/detail/50947/2010-02-06-12.03.15-by-rejon" target="_blank"&gt;OpenClipArt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this? Many argue that conference papers just aren't that valuable. They're not peer-reviewed (though some are) and often represent early results that will be further developed and presented formally in journals (though many aren't). Certainly they're cited less, but is this just a case of academic sour grapes: we can't find them so we say we never really wanted them anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have publishers, libraries and Open Access advocates ignored conferences because they're too hard -- or are they too hard because we've ignored them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we being responsible in withholding early and thus potentially unreliable results from the public, or are we being anti-democratic? If we care about public access to publicly funded research we should be asking these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we do? It's a big issue, but there are some obvious steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference organisers&lt;/strong&gt;: Think about open publication of the papers and posters presented. There's heaps of software out there to help manage this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;: If you support your academic community with OJS, look into whether there’d be interest in you supporting them with &lt;a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/"&gt;OCS&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors&lt;/strong&gt;: If the conference isn't publishing your paper, or doesn't have a clear plan for ongoing hosting, put it in your &lt;a href="http://www.opendoar.org/find.php"&gt;institutional repository&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.opendoar.org/find.php"&gt;disciplinary archive&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://figshare.com/"&gt;figshare&lt;/a&gt;, so researchers will be able to find (and cite) it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are only stop-gap solutions. In the long term what I think we really need is a global, multi-disciplinary archive for all conference outputs -- abstracts, papers, slides, posters, videos, hackathon code -- which may allow author self-deposit but whose main focus is on actively soliciting for bulk-deposit from entire conferences. If you agree (or disagree!) &lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/deborah.fitchett@lincoln.ac.nz"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;: this is a topic I'm continuing to research.&lt;/p&gt;
