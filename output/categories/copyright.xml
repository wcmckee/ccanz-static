&lt;h4&gt;The copyright regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright is the recognition of the creator’s interest in benefiting from their work. In the first statutory regime for copyright—the Statute of Anne—its purpose was recorded as the “encouragement of learning...[and of] learned men to compose and write useful books”.[1] Copyright attaches to any original ‘work’.[2] A ‘work’ is any physical manifestation of the application of time, skill and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, copyright exists in the following types of ‘work’: [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Sound recordings;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Films;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Communication works (sounds, visual images or other information broadcast to the public—e.g. the news); and&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Typographical arrangements of published editions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A work is original if it is not commonplace. It does not need to be unique, but it cannot be substantially similar to any original. Though this standard is often determined on a case-by-case basis, it means that any derivative work can only use the original as inspiration, and cannot express ideas in the same way as the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copyright owner has the exclusive right to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Copy;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Distribute;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Perform;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Play;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Show;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Communicate; or&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Adapt the work&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The copyright owner also has the right authorise any person to do any of the aforementioned acts.[4] Anyone who does any one of those acts without the permission of the copyright owner breaches copyright if that act is in relation to a whole or substantial part of the work.[5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Implications for teachers and schools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright raises two main educational issues: first, the use of copyrighted works in the learning process; and second, the use of works created by teachers themselves, but used subsequently by teachers at different schools. The Copyright Act clearly states what actions will breach copyright. [6] However, there are also many exceptions which apply to teachers and students, and it is less clear under what circumstances schools will be able to rely on those exceptions because their language is vague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine some of these exceptions. Teachers can make one copy of all or part of a work (excluding film or sound recordings): [7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;a) To prepare their lesson; or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;b) To assist them in delivering the lesson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;c) The copy is for the teacher’s use only&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;d) However, teachers may make multiple non-facsimile copies (e.g. copying out a poem by hand rather than photocopying or scanning).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are more restrictive if teachers want to provide copies to students.[8] Teachers can copy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;a) Up to 3% of the work; or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;b) Up to 3 pages of the work (whichever is greater); but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;c) The amount copied cannot exceed 50% of the whole work (e.g. if the desired extract is 3 pages, only one and a half pages may be copied)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;d) Teachers may not charge students for the copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the exceptions get even more specific regarding film and sound recordings. For films and soundtracks, teachers can copy that work: [9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;a) To prepare their lesson; or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;b) To assist them in delivering the lesson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;c) The lesson must be to instruct students on how to make such recordings—the recording must be used for its technical aspects, not for its substantive content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;d) Students of such classes may also copy such works, before, during, or after such a class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound recordings may only be copied where the lesson is either a language lesson, or is delivered by correspondence.[10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the rules regarding ‘performance’ works (e.g. dramatic or musical works, and film and TV works) are remarkably relaxed compared with the other rules. Teachers and students may perform literary, dramatic or musical works, or show films or other forms of broadcast works (e.g. radio): [11]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;a) To other students and teachers of the same school (this often excludes parents);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;b) The performance or showing must be for the purposes of instruction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools must store copyrighted material separately from other educational material and must identify the author and source.[12] Access can only be given those who can show (e.g. by logging-on) that they have permission to access to the copy.[13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copyright Act provides a general ‘fair dealing’ exception limited to use for the purposes of criticism, review, reporting of current events, [14] and for research or private study.[15] This is most applicable to students. Students can copy a reasonable portion of works: ‘Reasonableness’ is often defined in terms of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;i) The purpose use (i.e. the ‘fair dealing’ purposes described above);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;ii) The nature of the work (i.e. it is less fair to copy a work that required more skill to produce (e.g. a sculpture or painting));&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;iii) The effect copying the work will have on its value;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;iv) The quantity of material copied and the proportion of the final work based on copied material; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;v) Whether the material could have been bought, and if so, at a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, teachers cannot provide students with the copies unless they comply with the 3% or 3 page limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foregoing exceptions apply only to the copying and communication or performance of works. Thus, these exceptions do not allow teachers to adapt the works to suit their own particular needs because there is no ‘fair dealing’ provision which includes adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Solving the issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Copyright Act allows owners to license (that is, give permission for) certain actions.[16] However, obtaining licences to use copyrighted materials often involves a significant investment in time and money. If a request for permission is denied, the statutory exceptions, noted above, apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, schools might be more willing than other creators to license the adaptation and use of teaching resources. After all, there is mutual benefit from permitting the use of copyrighted work for education, and little corresponding financial benefit from publishing the resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons Licences are one tool that BOTs can use to make resources freely available to others who wish to use them. The licences notify users which actions the copyright holder allows others undertake, and what actions they may not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more creative option would be to encourage more independent research in learning. For example, having students research the material (within guidelines provided by the teacher) would avoid the rule that teachers cannot provide more than 3% or 3 pages of a work to their students. Any use of copyrighted material by students would fall under one or both of the fair dealing exceptions. Of course, this shift in teaching style would not be appropriate for all students or schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reforming copyright&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The education exceptions have remained largely untouched by incremental reform—little has been done to address the greater collaboration which the internet has allowed. There is a greater ability for teachers and students spread ideas and to adapt them to suit their own needs—but the copyright regime does not allow this without permission. In effect, derivative works must be created from the ground up because copyrighted works must, in effect, form only the kernel of a derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copyright regime’s purpose does not fit well with education. It is designed to incentivise the production of knowledge by protecting creators’ financial interests. However, if the creators do not benefit, then the underlying purpose of the regime is redundant. It is also arguable that there is a public interest in allowing teachers to adapt works because it allows for the dissemination and for adaptation of educational resources, resulting in better outcomes. Currently, the copyright regime stifles teachers’ creativity (and thus students’ learning) in the name of protecting a non-existent benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their report on the education exceptions under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) concluded that the confusing education exceptions should be replaced by a general ‘fair dealing’ exception.[17] Australia’s education exceptions are very similar to New Zealand’s and were criticised as “inflexible” and “impractical” and inconsistent in their application.[18] The ALRC noted the position in the USA and UK allows “minimal, non-commercial and fair” use, which does not displace the “sale and licensing of education materials”.[19]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the ALRC report did not deal with teacher-created content and was rejected by the Australian government. Thus, it seems that concrete reform for adaptive work for teacher-created content is far from becoming a reality any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2013, CCANZ organised a meeting about the potential development of an indigenous knowledge notice. This notice - similar in motivation to the &lt;a href="http://localcontexts.org/tk-labels/" target="_blank"&gt;Traditional Knowledge labels from Local Contexts&lt;/a&gt; - was intended to provide a tool to make it easier for kaitiaki of indigenous works to give clear statements about what could or could not be done with digital reproductions of their works, where they chose to release those works more openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing Creative Commons licences are intended to provide clear, open permissions for others to reuse works that are in copyright. The licences are available in many different languages, including te reo Māori, so any copyright holder can release their work in a legally robust - and human-readable - way, without having to pay a lawyer for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do we need another legal tool? The problem is three-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, many indigenous works have fallen out of copyright, which means that there are no longer any copyright restrictions on their reuse. This means that the Creative Commons licences, which require attribution and can be used to restrict derivative and non-commercial use, cannot be used, as these licences are based on copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Creative Commons licences intentionally do not attempt to restrict perceived misuse of a work. This is an important part of the licences, which are intended to grow a commons of culture and knowledge that can be accessed, copied and reused by anyone. However, this also means that the licences are not appropriate for every kind of work, including some indigenous works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, there is no legal recognition of indigenous works as a special or unique type of intellectual property. While New Zealand law provides different protections for various kinds of works, including patents, trademarks and copyrights, there is no specific protection to recognise the special character of indigenous works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may change in the future, but in the meantime we have a problem. A potential solution is to create a notice that allows the kaitiaki of indigenous works to give others clear guidance on what can and cannot be done with the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution has its limits. As mentioned above, the notice won’t necessarily have any legal teeth for works that have fallen from copyright. Those who break the terms of the CC licences will have infringed copyright, but there is no equivalent protection for a notice of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the notice, then, will initially be more cultural than legal. The purpose will be to give people clear guidance about what can and cannot be done with certain works. The presumption, here, is that most incidents of misuse of indigenous works are done less from malice than from ignorance. The notice will aim to address this ignorance, in terms chosen by the kaitiaki of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting in late 2013, Professor Susy Frankel agreed to investigate how such a notice could be derived from the existing Creative Commons licences. With this work complete, the next step is for Karaitiana Taiuru, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand and other interested parties to organise hui to learn more about the needs of any interested individuals or communities.

&lt;p&gt;Copyright is one of the more flexible forms of intellectual property. It can be used to protect almost any form of expression, whether literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, industrial, sound recording, film, communication work, or typographical arrangement.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from what point does an original copyright work exist? For example, the creation of a single word does not attract copyright protection. That single word does not hold enough creative effort or “originality” to be considered an original literary work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, copying someone else’s existing work, even if showing that work in a new way, is not likely to give rise to an original work.2 A work cannot be original if it is a copy of, or an infringement of, an existing work.3 It must be independently created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an original work may be created by expending sufficient skill, judgement or labour, even if that work incorporates publicly available information. This may occur, for example, where a person creates a new compilation of available information, such a new recipe or a new directory. In these examples, which require the author’s skill, judgement or labour, the level of creativity or ingenuity required for “originality” may be relatively low.4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if a work is not particularly creative, then how much skill, judgement or labour is required before it becomes an “original” copyright work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Case Study: The Dead Sea Scrolls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls are ancient religious manuscripts dating back to 200 BC. Part of the Scrolls is the Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah (“MMT”), a particularly sought after Hebrew document that has only been discovered in fragments.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1954, professors Elisha Qimron and John Strugnell identified, transcribed, and reconstructed countless fragments from six different manuscripts containing the MMT. The professors arranged the manuscript fragments in a way they believed would most accurately represent the original MMT text. That process took 11 years and, even then, more than half the MMT was missing. The professors then filled in, or interpolated, the gaps based on their extensive knowledge and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting ‘Qimron’ version of MMT was finally officially published in 1994. However in 1992 (before the official publication), a member of the Biblical Archaeology Society published a large part of the Qimron MMT, without the professor’s permission. He did this in order to make the MMT available to other scholars, fearing that access to it would otherwise be heavily restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qimron sued the Biblical Archaeology Society for copyright infringement, saying that his version of the MMT was unique, and an original copyright work. (Keep in mind that, at the same time, the professors claimed to have formed the most accurate complete version of the original MMT.) So, could the professors claim copyright in the fruits of their labour as “original” literary works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli Supreme Court held that, yes, the work was an original literary work that attracted copyright protection. The professors’ work on the MMT was not purely technical or mechanical labour yielding a predetermined or known result. Instead, the “additional soul” that the professors inspired in the fragments of the Scrolls, with their labour, made them the owners of the copyright in the Qimron MMT text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Factual Enquiry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Qimron case is a particularly fact-specific one, but so are most copyright cases. All of the facts must be considered, including:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The “starting point” of the work;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The whole of the completed work;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The extent of the copying and alteration (whether a substantial part of the original work survived, so as to appear to be a copy of the original work);&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The quality of the work, rather than the quantity of what has been taken;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Whether mere literal or mechanical copying has taken place;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Whether advantage has been taken of the original work.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After performing this enquiry, one should be left with a reasonable overall impression of whether the new work is in fact an “original” work, regardless of whether it was formed from a spark of creativity, or from the author’s blood, sweat, and tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram is a popular mobile application, infamous for its digital filters with alluring names (think Valencia &amp;amp; Amaro), and the use of the hashtag symbol (#). Instagram allows users to upload pictures or videos colloquially known as “grams”, which can then shared with their Instagram followers and on other social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “re-gram” has been coined, describing the process whereby an existing gram is copied from one user and reproduced on another’s profile. The reproduction is typically achieved by either a specifically designed application or simply by taking a screenshot of the original gram on a smartphone. In practice this means that  humorous or memorable grams will go viral, spreading to other social media platforms such as Facebook and Pinterest. The spread of certain grams can be accelerated by the use of the hashtag; a user can search for grams based on a particular theme by looking up a corresponding hashtag. And if they like what they see, they may feel compelled to re-gram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With thousands of grams being uploaded to Instagram every second, the question arises as to who owns them. According to Instagram’s &lt;a title="Instagram terms of use" href="https://help.instagram.com/478745558852511" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt;, users represent and warrant that they own the content posted, or that they have the right to post such content.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" async="" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems regarding copyright ownership is that users, including businesses and celebrities, will often re-gram photos without any consideration for the copyright implications. This is certainly not a socially responsible practice, and it is this blissful ignorance that has led to parties being &lt;a title="Guardian article about Instagram" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/us-news-blog/2013/feb/05/instagram-users-fightback-stolen-photos" target="_blank"&gt;caught out&lt;/a&gt; for using other people’s grams. Further, it is also common for media to be re-grammed multiple times to the point where the original source can not be located, and even then, crediting a source in itself is not a defence to copyright infringement. Interestingly, in the United Kingdom, the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 provides a solution to this. It allows a person to use a copyrighted work for free without the consent of the owner if, after a “diligent search” in accordance with the prescribed regulations, the owner cannot be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solution to the danger of the re-gram -- and one that all users can benefit from -- is Creative Commons licensing. There are a variety of licences available to users; all require attribution and some are for non-commercial use only.  Users can manually add a CC licence in their Instagram profile description or in the caption of a gram. They can also follow this up by hashtagging “creative commons”, thereby enabling other users to search for openly licensed media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram does not currently facilitate a platform for users to license their grams with ease, but there are other ways of doing this. For example, Instagram allows users to directly share photos to their Flickr accounts and, in turn, Flickr allows its users to choose a particular CC licence under which they can share their photos. Flickr also enables users to search for photos that have been published online under the different CC licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is  &lt;a title="I Am CC" href="http://i-am-cc.org/" target="_blank"&gt;i-am-cc.org&lt;/a&gt;, a third-party archive that allows users to CC-license photos for three months from the date they sign up to the archive. i-am-cc.org’s &lt;a title="I Am CC Manifesto" href="http://i-am-cc.org/manifesto/" target="_blank"&gt;manifesto &lt;/a&gt;explains that the three-month period is imposed as people may forget what they signed up for, and i-am-cc endeavours to be a “legitimate repository of free images”. There are also a variety of websites supplying CC-licensed images for the public that instagrammers may re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the re-gram is something that Instagram users should adopt with caution. The use of CC licensing is an excellent mechanism to lawfully perpetuate media, and, the more users who opt in, the more media they have to benefit from. It is yet to be seen whether Instagram will allow users to opt into CC licensing their grams. This may be a smart move, and the issue may become more prominent as more parties are caught out for irresponsible re-grams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know, NZGOAL is a great piece of government policy, which was approved by Cabinet in 2010. In essence, NZGOAL advocates for the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some organisations, like Public Service Departments, are directed to use NZGOAL; state services agencies are strongly encouraged, while school Boards of Trustees are invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years on, we’ve seen a reasonably steady uptake on NZGOAL. Public Service Departments are getting steadily better at using open licensing by default, especially data-heavy agencies like Statistics New Zealand, Land Information New Zealand and Ministry for the Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also seeing uptake in the GLAM sector, with Te Papa, National Library of New Zealand and Auckland Museum all making commitments to open licensing. Schools are also beginning to use CC - we’ve currently got around ninety schools with CC policies, and more to come in the future. Local government and research institutions are also beginning to make moves towards greater openness, which is great to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As NZGOAL gradually became the default setting for the release of an increasing number copyright and non-copyright works, New Zealand Open Government Data Programme decided that the policy and guidance materials it uses needed updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important change was the simplification of the review and release process flow-chart. You can read about the other changes &lt;a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal2/#changelog" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important, though -- from our point of view at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, at least -- is that Creative Commons HQ finished its exhaustive process of developing &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/version4" target="_blank"&gt;the 4.0 version of the CC licences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original version of NZGOAL recommended the use of the Creative Commons 3.0 New Zealand licences. These licences had been ‘ported’ for New Zealand law. If you’re interested in learning more about this, &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/whats-licence/" target="_blank"&gt;check out this interview we conducted with Andrew Matangi&lt;/a&gt;, who led the initial porting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is nothing wrong with the 3.0 NZ licences, the arrival of the 4.0 licences is a welcome opportunity to ensure that everyone in the world is using the same CC licences. The CC licence chooser -- which many people use to get their standard licensing statement -- also puts some hurdles in the way of those people looking for the earlier, ported licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that the NZGOAL team have decided to officially recommend the 4.0 licences. While agencies can still decide to use the older 3.0 NZ licences if they want, the guidance material provided by NZGOAL will recommend the 4.0 licences. Over time, we can expect more and more agencies to go down the CC 4.0 road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you with works licensed under CC 3.0 NZ -- or any other licence -- you don’t need to worry. This licence is still legally valid and robust, and can still be used to licence your work. And if you want to change, that’s fine too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Government</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/2015/05/21/nzgoal-version-2.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 23:21:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework - Version 2</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/nzgoal.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

In case you didn't make it to any of these events, we've embedded the slides below, along with a short summary of what they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Matt McGregor and Elizabeth Heritage, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt and Elizabeth began by introducing Creative Commons licensing in Aotearoa New Zealand. They then noted that, while new technologies had provided heritage organisations new opportunities to share their digital collections for reuse, copyright and licensing was still a significant barrier. Usage rights statements, they said, were often vague, overly restrictive &amp;amp; not standardised across the sector. They then ran through three specific recommendations, outlined in the slides, before giving a brief introduction to the licences themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=46702250&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Keitha Booth, New Zealand Open Government Information and Data Programme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keitha introduced the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework, which advocates for the use of CC licensing across the state sector. Keitha noted that the Open Government Data and Information Programme had expanded its focus to local government. She outlined the NZGOAL adoption process, and the policy framework for each institution, both of which are detailed in the slides, below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=46702435&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Victoria Leachman, Rights Advisor, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria outlined Te Papa's experiences with Creative Commons licensing, beginning with the Rita Angus podcasts in 2008. Victoria noted that CC licensing these podcasts had enabled them to be used by other institutions touring the exhibition - without Te Papa having to write detailed usage agreements. After running through several other CC projects, Victoria discussed the download project, which has so far released over 48,000 images for free high-resolution download. Victoria noted that usage was much greater than predicted at the beginning of the project, and that it was being used for a range of purposes. Victoria closed her presentation by outlining the challenges to open access and open licensing for the GLAM sector, and highlighting the approach taken thus far by Te Papa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=46702446&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager, DigitalNZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After introducing DigitalNZ and its mission, Thomasin showed the famous 'magic hat' diagram, which outlines how content from individuals and organisations around New Zealand is harvested by the DigitalNZ and made more easily searchable by the aforementioned magic hat (otherwise known as the DigitalNZ API). She then gave an overview of DigitalNZ's approach to rights, and pointed out some of the common issues faced by DigitalNZ as it attempts to provide clear rights information to end users. Thomasin argued that the point of working through these rights issues was to help produce "A world in which our shared cultural heritage is open to all, regardless of their background. A world in which people are no longer passive consumers of cultural content created by an elite, but contribute, participate, create and share." Thomasin concluded by several standout local and international open GLAM case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=46702442&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader, The Alexander Turnbull Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark began by noting that the internal debates around use and reuse within the National Library of New Zealand repeated debates that are taking place in society at large. Many of the issues arodund reusing collection items were difficult, and many of them turned on the notion of trust. Mark then noted that rights statements across the sector were inconsistent, and that the National Library of New Zealand had developed a set of policy principles to addressed this inconsistency, which are outlined in the slides. Implementation, he said, was ongoing, though three issues currently being addressed were donor and depositor agreements, a flowchart to guide the release process and improving the rights statements and licensing on indigenous knowledge works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=46702437&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Allison Brown, Digital Services Coordinator, University of Otago Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison discussed the use of Creative Commons licensing within the University of Otago library. In particular, she gave her experience in discussing CC licensing with rights holders, applying CC licensing in a library context, supporting the use of CC by others, managing the use of CC and promoting CC to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, we turned around twice and suddenly it’s the fourth week of the Creative Commons Road Trip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Matt McGregor and I were in the same room as each other for the first time in a couple of weeks, and we took the opportunity to swap notes. It’s been a crazy busy fortnight but so much fun. Huge thanks to our awesome team of speakers and facilitators who are doing such a brilliant job -- and thank you to everyone who has come along so far. We’re really enjoying meeting new people, fielding new questions (that always make us think!), and hearing new stories about how Kiwis are using -- or want to use -- Creative Commons in such a range of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 2 of the Road Trip saw us travelling around the country; Matt in the North Island and me in the South. Between us -- and with the help of our trusty facilitators -- we delivered events in Hamilton, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Whanganui. Then Week 3 was even busier: the Creative Commons Road Trip made back to Auckland, Hamilton, and Dunedin, plus branching out to Tauranga and Palmerston North. Events have been targeted at the schools and heritage sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been great to have requests come in from schools and heritage institutions around the country for events where they are. We’ve added Napier to the mix now! The CC Road Trip will be there on 1-2 April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-488" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CC BY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that weren’t enough, we’re really pleased to announce that we’re extending the Road Trip and branching out into Open Education. Come along to hear about the future of Open Educational Resources in Aotearoa, featuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Billy Meinke, formerly of Creative Commons International, who will talk about his experience with some of the world’s largest OER projects, including the US Government’s $2billion TAAACT grants for OERs at community colleges.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Simon Hart, Richard White and Erika Pearson from the Media Text Hack team at the University of Otago, who will talk about the development of an open, CC-licensed Media Studies textbook — over the course of a weekend.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Matt McGregor, Public Lead of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, who will talk about the future of OERs in the Kiwi tertiary sector, and talk about how educators and institutions can create, use and adopt open textbooks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be running events in mid-April in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch, completely free. &lt;a title="OER events" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2015/03/open-education-in-aotearoa/" target="_blank"&gt;Register here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards to Week 4! There are still places left for our Wellington and Christchurch heritage sector events, so &lt;a title="GLAM Road Trip" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;register today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-GLAM.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-489" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-GLAM-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CC BY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have officially completed the first five events of the Creative Commons Road Trip! When we planned the events back in December last year, we were expecting a quiet start to the month, with some &lt;a title="CC Road Trip schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;schools events&lt;/a&gt; in Auckland and Wellington, gradually branching out to Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin in the second week. In the third and fourth week, we were planning to basically repeat that pattern, shifting focus to the &lt;a title="CC Road Trip GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;heritage sector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we promoted the month, though, we started to get requests from other parts of the country,  quickly turning a tour of the main centres into a truly national road trip. Now that the organisational dust has settled, we’ve decided to also visit Tauranga, Napier, Havelock North, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Nelson and Greymouth. We’re also making plans to visit Hutt City, Whangarei and Invercargill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-488" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CC BY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we had a busy first week! In addition to the Creative Commons schools events in Wellington and Auckland, we held events in Greymouth, Nelson and Havelock North. Attendance varied: we had a small turnout for an after-school event in Auckland, though the staffroom at Havelock North High School at 8am was full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights from week one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The Network for Learning officially joined the Creative Commons Road Trip, with Tim Kong, Pete Hall and Carolyn Stuart attending the school events.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We had some &lt;a title="Bay of Plenty Times" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&amp;amp;objectid=11412205" target="_blank"&gt;handy coverage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Bay of Plenty Times&lt;/i&gt;, advertising our events in Tauranga on 16 March.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Melissa Laing, one of the new CC regional facilitators, gave her first (of many, we hope!) introductions to CC licensing, alongside Pete Hall from N4L and Esther Casey from Cognition Education.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;As one of our speakers was ill, Matt skyped into an event at Nelson Provincial Museum -- from a half-full internet cafe in Napier. Both the Nelson museum community and the Napier internet-cafe community now have a working knowledge of CC licensing in the heritage sector.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We’re receiving a heap of requests to send out resources. Keep them coming!&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We’ve launched our &lt;a title="CC resources" href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;new resources page&lt;/a&gt;, full to the brim with brochures, videos, posters and case studies on CC licensing in tertiary education, research, heritage and schools.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In week two -- starting today! -- we’re going to be running schools events in Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton and Dunedin, as well as a heritage event in Whanganui. Week two happens to overlap with international &lt;a title="Open Education Week" href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Education Week&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re excited to join our friends and colleagues around the world in spreading the news on the benefits of open educational resources. There are still places available at all our upcoming events, so &lt;a title="CC Road Trip" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/12/announcing-our-march-events/" target="_blank"&gt;register today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
