&lt;p&gt;In late 2013, CCANZ organised a meeting about the potential development of an indigenous knowledge notice. This notice - similar in motivation to the &lt;a href="http://localcontexts.org/tk-labels/" target="_blank"&gt;Traditional Knowledge labels from Local Contexts&lt;/a&gt; - was intended to provide a tool to make it easier for kaitiaki of indigenous works to give clear statements about what could or could not be done with digital reproductions of their works, where they chose to release those works more openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing Creative Commons licences are intended to provide clear, open permissions for others to reuse works that are in copyright. The licences are available in many different languages, including te reo Māori, so any copyright holder can release their work in a legally robust - and human-readable - way, without having to pay a lawyer for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do we need another legal tool? The problem is three-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, many indigenous works have fallen out of copyright, which means that there are no longer any copyright restrictions on their reuse. This means that the Creative Commons licences, which require attribution and can be used to restrict derivative and non-commercial use, cannot be used, as these licences are based on copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the Creative Commons licences intentionally do not attempt to restrict perceived misuse of a work. This is an important part of the licences, which are intended to grow a commons of culture and knowledge that can be accessed, copied and reused by anyone. However, this also means that the licences are not appropriate for every kind of work, including some indigenous works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, there is no legal recognition of indigenous works as a special or unique type of intellectual property. While New Zealand law provides different protections for various kinds of works, including patents, trademarks and copyrights, there is no specific protection to recognise the special character of indigenous works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may change in the future, but in the meantime we have a problem. A potential solution is to create a notice that allows the kaitiaki of indigenous works to give others clear guidance on what can and cannot be done with the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution has its limits. As mentioned above, the notice won’t necessarily have any legal teeth for works that have fallen from copyright. Those who break the terms of the CC licences will have infringed copyright, but there is no equivalent protection for a notice of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the notice, then, will initially be more cultural than legal. The purpose will be to give people clear guidance about what can and cannot be done with certain works. The presumption, here, is that most incidents of misuse of indigenous works are done less from malice than from ignorance. The notice will aim to address this ignorance, in terms chosen by the kaitiaki of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting in late 2013, Professor Susy Frankel agreed to investigate how such a notice could be derived from the existing Creative Commons licences. With this work complete, the next step is for Karaitiana Taiuru, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand and other interested parties to organise hui to learn more about the needs of any interested individuals or communities.

&lt;p&gt;At present, we're particularly keen to help local schools implement &lt;a title="Creative Commons in Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools/"&gt;Creative Commons policies&lt;/a&gt;, though if you have another local organisation that would like to help, feel free to get in touch. You don't have to be an expert -- we can teach you everything you'll need to know -- though some knowledge of copyright and Creative Commons licensing is preferred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are over 2,500 schools in New Zealand, and we're going to need your help to get to all of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, fill out the form, below, and give us a quick sense of your background, region and which particular school(s) you would like to help out with. While you're at it, please check out &lt;a title="Volunteer Guidelines" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/volunteer-guidelines/"&gt;our volunteer guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which outline your rights and responsibilities as a volunteer for CCANZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll get in touch and help you make contact with your chosen school. You will  work with us to provide any assistance the school happens to need. This might involve a staff training session, a meeting with school leaders &amp;amp; the BoT, distributing print resources or simply acting as a point of contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know, NZGOAL is a great piece of government policy, which was approved by Cabinet in 2010. In essence, NZGOAL advocates for the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some organisations, like Public Service Departments, are directed to use NZGOAL; state services agencies are strongly encouraged, while school Boards of Trustees are invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years on, we’ve seen a reasonably steady uptake on NZGOAL. Public Service Departments are getting steadily better at using open licensing by default, especially data-heavy agencies like Statistics New Zealand, Land Information New Zealand and Ministry for the Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also seeing uptake in the GLAM sector, with Te Papa, National Library of New Zealand and Auckland Museum all making commitments to open licensing. Schools are also beginning to use CC - we’ve currently got around ninety schools with CC policies, and more to come in the future. Local government and research institutions are also beginning to make moves towards greater openness, which is great to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As NZGOAL gradually became the default setting for the release of an increasing number copyright and non-copyright works, New Zealand Open Government Data Programme decided that the policy and guidance materials it uses needed updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important change was the simplification of the review and release process flow-chart. You can read about the other changes &lt;a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal2/#changelog" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important, though -- from our point of view at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, at least -- is that Creative Commons HQ finished its exhaustive process of developing &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/version4" target="_blank"&gt;the 4.0 version of the CC licences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original version of NZGOAL recommended the use of the Creative Commons 3.0 New Zealand licences. These licences had been ‘ported’ for New Zealand law. If you’re interested in learning more about this, &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/whats-licence/" target="_blank"&gt;check out this interview we conducted with Andrew Matangi&lt;/a&gt;, who led the initial porting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is nothing wrong with the 3.0 NZ licences, the arrival of the 4.0 licences is a welcome opportunity to ensure that everyone in the world is using the same CC licences. The CC licence chooser -- which many people use to get their standard licensing statement -- also puts some hurdles in the way of those people looking for the earlier, ported licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that the NZGOAL team have decided to officially recommend the 4.0 licences. While agencies can still decide to use the older 3.0 NZ licences if they want, the guidance material provided by NZGOAL will recommend the 4.0 licences. Over time, we can expect more and more agencies to go down the CC 4.0 road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you with works licensed under CC 3.0 NZ -- or any other licence -- you don’t need to worry. This licence is still legally valid and robust, and can still be used to licence your work. And if you want to change, that’s fine too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Government</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2015/05/21/nzgoal-version-2.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 23:21:12 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Creative Commons GLAM Road Trip</title><link>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2015/04/07/the-creative-commons-glam-roadtrip.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the month of March (and a little bit of April), Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand have been travelling around New Zealand spreading the word about open access and open licensing for local Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums. In case you didn't make it to any of these events, we've embedded the slides below, along with a short summary of what they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Matt McGregor and Elizabeth Heritage, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt and Elizabeth began by introducing Creative Commons licensing in Aotearoa New Zealand. They then noted that, while new technologies had provided heritage organisations new opportunities to share their digital collections for reuse, copyright and licensing was still a significant barrier. Usage rights statements, they said, were often vague, overly restrictive &amp;amp; not standardised across the sector. They then ran through three specific recommendations, outlined in the slides, before giving a brief introduction to the licences themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=46702250&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Keitha Booth, New Zealand Open Government Information and Data Programme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keitha introduced the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework, which advocates for the use of CC licensing across the state sector. Keitha noted that the Open Government Data and Information Programme had expanded its focus to local government. She outlined the NZGOAL adoption process, and the policy framework for each institution, both of which are detailed in the slides, below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=46702435&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Victoria Leachman, Rights Advisor, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria outlined Te Papa's experiences with Creative Commons licensing, beginning with the Rita Angus podcasts in 2008. Victoria noted that CC licensing these podcasts had enabled them to be used by other institutions touring the exhibition - without Te Papa having to write detailed usage agreements. After running through several other CC projects, Victoria discussed the download project, which has so far released over 48,000 images for free high-resolution download. Victoria noted that usage was much greater than predicted at the beginning of the project, and that it was being used for a range of purposes. Victoria closed her presentation by outlining the challenges to open access and open licensing for the GLAM sector, and highlighting the approach taken thus far by Te Papa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=46702446&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager, DigitalNZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After introducing DigitalNZ and its mission, Thomasin showed the famous 'magic hat' diagram, which outlines how content from individuals and organisations around New Zealand is harvested by the DigitalNZ and made more easily searchable by the aforementioned magic hat (otherwise known as the DigitalNZ API). She then gave an overview of DigitalNZ's approach to rights, and pointed out some of the common issues faced by DigitalNZ as it attempts to provide clear rights information to end users. Thomasin argued that the point of working through these rights issues was to help produce "A world in which our shared cultural heritage is open to all, regardless of their background. A world in which people are no longer passive consumers of cultural content created by an elite, but contribute, participate, create and share." Thomasin concluded by several standout local and international open GLAM case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=46702442&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader, The Alexander Turnbull Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark began by noting that the internal debates around use and reuse within the National Library of New Zealand repeated debates that are taking place in society at large. Many of the issues arodund reusing collection items were difficult, and many of them turned on the notion of trust. Mark then noted that rights statements across the sector were inconsistent, and that the National Library of New Zealand had developed a set of policy principles to addressed this inconsistency, which are outlined in the slides. Implementation, he said, was ongoing, though three issues currently being addressed were donor and depositor agreements, a flowchart to guide the release process and improving the rights statements and licensing on indigenous knowledge works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=46702437&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;Allison Brown, Digital Services Coordinator, University of Otago Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison discussed the use of Creative Commons licensing within the University of Otago library. In particular, she gave her experience in discussing CC licensing with rights holders, applying CC licensing in a library context, supporting the use of CC by others, managing the use of CC and promoting CC to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Announcements and Week-Long Activities&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of Canterbury and Lincoln University&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Release&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a joint initiative with Lincoln University , the University of Canterbury will be launching 6 short videos each with a different researcher explaining how their research has benefited from being open access. They will be showcased on &lt;a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/library" target="_blank"&gt;the main Library webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of Canterbury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://library.canterbury.ac.nz/ir/repositoryfaq.php#MandatoryDeposit" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mandatory Deposit OA Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University’s policy of Mandatory Deposit in the UC Research Repository will come into effect from 20 October 2014, which is aimed at increasing the visibility, impact and accessibility of UC research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of Canterbury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UC Library is also aiming to make verse translations of Aeschylus' Oresteia Trilogy and the seven Tragedies of Sophocles by UC scholar Robin Bond from the Department of Classics available for the first time. They will have a CC-BY licence, letting them be used as open textbooks, for performance, or any other purpose. We aim to publish these plays over the coming year with the first one being made available in Open Access Week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uploadathon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university library is organising an “Uploadathon” - a series of workshops in which the library will help academics upload manuscripts to the University Repository and answer any concerns they may have around the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Monday 20 October&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of Otago&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Creative Commons Licences and Māori Works&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CC licences are not always considered appropriate for Māori cultural works. CC licences cannot be applied to works that no longer qualify for copyright protection, which is likely to be true of many older Māori works. Also, the licences do not provide protections against culturally offensive or otherwise inappropriate uses of Māori works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Free Legal Notice for Māori Works&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, CCANZ is looking to produce a free legal notice that Māori can use to release cultural works more openly. The notice will be a clear and standard expression of the freedoms and restrictions that cultural producers or kaitiaki of Māori cultural works wish to apply. While the notice cannot grant additional legal protections, it will aim to educate the public about the status of Māori works, while at the same time allowing for greater access, sharing and reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why a 'Notice' and not a 'Licence'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 'licence' is based on rights that are legally recognised, and full legal recognition of rights to mātauranga Māori and taonga works does not yet exist. A 'notice' will help to ensure that members of the public are aware of the status of a particular work, and also know how to share and reuse it appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How Will It Work?

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the details are yet to be determined, it is likely that a statement and symbol would be attached to a work. These would, in turn, link to a standard, legally robust statement of the freedoms and restrictions that the work's kaitiaki wish to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="color:#800000;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;More Information&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Land Information New Zealand officials, prompted by the support in NZGOAL for free culture CC licenses, started liberating the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/09/linz-data-service/" target="_blank"&gt;publicly-funded map data they hold&lt;/a&gt; under CC-BY, they may have anticipated that their data could end up in OpenStreetMap.org (OSM). OSM is the libre licensed, crowdsourced, world mapping project (formerly CC-BY-SA, now Open DataBase License) created as a free-as-in-speech alternative to Google Maps, which licenses copyright map and image data from other companies. What they probably never imagined was their data appearing on community sites like the new NSW government funded &lt;a href="http://www.timebanking.com.au/" target="_blank"&gt;TimeBanking platform&lt;/a&gt; and in maps powered by Leafet, the free code, mobile-friendly, web map engine which uses OSM as the default source for map data. Such are the unintended benefits that flow from sharing in the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-6030" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg" alt="X" width="546" height="366"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Screenshot of &lt;a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/1910-otago-075m-rural-aerial-photos-2004-2011/" target="_blank"&gt;Otago 0.75m aerial photography&lt;/a&gt; by LINZ. Made available under a Creative Commons Attribution licence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as OSM contributed to the development of websites using Leaflet, the cultural commons also has a contribution to make to the development of free code speech recognition software. Douglas Bagnall gave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BGLrLXm3c" target="_blank"&gt;a great talk&lt;/a&gt; about free code speech recognition engines at Kiwi PyCon 2012, and one of the main non-coding challenges he identified is the lack of a suitably large corpus of spoken speech with which to train' the software (the interesting bits for non-coders starts at about 3:00), particularly for less common accents like New Zealand English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas mentioned a site called VoxForge.org and encouraged us all to record some speech for it. VoxForge collects samples of speech to "compile them into acoustic models for use with Open Source speech recognition engines", with both the acoustic models and the source data are made available under the GNU General Public License, the free code software license used by the Linux kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voxforge is a great resource, but it would be a lot of work to drive enough 'Nu Zylnd' accented speakers there. and it occurred to me recently that there is another source of spoken speech for which there is strong argument for libre licensing; public interest radio. Releasing audio programs made for National Radio, student radio, and community access radio, under a libre license (eg CC-BY), has always seemed like a no-brainer to me. Even before I set up &lt;a href="http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/05/07/cc-nz@groups.creativecommons.org.nz" target="_blank"&gt;the CC-NZ email list&lt;/a&gt;, I was contacting community radio people and telling them about the potential benefits of podcasting and CC licensing for increasing program exposure, as part of my work with Aotearoa.Indymedia.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Radio are publicly-owned and funded, and currently podcast all their programs in both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats. Student radio stations have also been experimenting with recording their shows and turning them into podcasts, and if they libre licensed the sometimes substantial spoken word parts of recordings like &lt;a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/radio1/" target="_blank"&gt;the Radio1 shows shared on MixCloud&lt;/a&gt;, they'd be unlikely to miss out on any commercial return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community access radio stations, as their name suggests, exist to give special interest groups in our communities access to the airwaves, so their unique voices have a chance to be heard in broadcast media. Access stations are heavily subsidised by public broadcasting funding, and their programs aren't expected to have commercial potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever these programs are rebroadcast, both the program producers, and the public who subsidize their production, get more bang for their buck. Over the last decade or so, access radio stations have been building up the infrastructure to digitally record programs, so they can be made available as podcasts, on sites like accessradio.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I notice in all three cases though, is that despite NZGOAL-inspired wave of CC license adoptions across public service organisations from LINZ, to schools and tertiary institutions, to archives and museums, I see no sign of CC licenses on locally made radio so far. I'm guessing one issue is legal confusion and risk aversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if I want to CC my radio program, what about the copyright songs I played during the program? Who owns the copyright on ads, and is it acceptable to remove them? Radio stations and rebroadcast sites can pay a fixed fee to collection organisations like NZRIA and APRA for permission to play the songs, but they can't pass on that permission to anyone who rebroadcasts the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do to show public radio stations that libre licensing - CC or otherwise - is a good fit for their organizational mission, and help them negotiate the legal minefields around copyright? Between them, the RadioNZ, community access, and students stations have vast numbers of hours of recordings, covering a wide range of kiwi accents spoken regularly on ethnic community radio programs. Having these available under a libre license would have benefits beyond just sharing the information and perspective included in public interest radio programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could also be tremendously helpful to people working on getting free code/ open source speech recognition software to recognise New Zilnd accents, which in turn would be tremendously helpful for any kiwi wanting a speech-operated computer that respects their software freedom. The same would be true for speakers of Te Reo Māori, and other Polynesian languages, who, like NZ English speakers, are also less likely to record enough speech at sites like VoxForge for them to generate a useful acoustic model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In '&lt;a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Coming Civil War over General Purpose Computing&lt;/a&gt;', Cory Doctorow asks us to consider the implications if the proprietary software running on many of our personal computers was instead running on our bionic legs;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;"If I can lo-jack your legs, I can lease them to you with the confidence of my power to repo them if you default on payments. If I can't, I may not lease you legs unless you've got a lot of money to begin with. But if your legs can decide to walk to the repo-depot without your consent, you will be totally screwed the day that muggers, rapists, griefers or the secret police figure out how to hijack that facility."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like bionic legs, accessibility tools like speech recognition and text-to-speech are augmentations which restore equalit, helping people with conditions from blindness to quadraplegia to have the full use of computers and the internet that most of us take for granted. Such essential tools should not be subject to the price pumping and hidden agendas that go with proprietary sofware.&lt;/p&gt;

The events featured lightning talks from a handful of experts in government, law and education, who outlined the legal, technical and cultural reasons for schools to implement a Creative Commons policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we couldn't manage to record video of the events, we have recorded the audio for the final event in Wellington.

CCANZ works to achieve these goals in two ways. First, it offers free licences. Second, it runs eight different projects, which advocate for licence use is various areas, such as research, data, government and heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt then ran through eight different points, which are detailed in the slides. The general point of his talk was that while the internet and digital technologies have made sharing and reuse very easy, copyright law still represents a significant legal barrier. This is particularly true in the case of teaching resources, which remain the property of the Board of Trustees. He finished his talk by suggesting that Creative Commons licensing -- and a Creative Commons policy -- can help to address these IP problems in New Zealand schools, while actively encouraging sharing and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[/toggle]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[slideshare id=32786678&amp;amp;w=476&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;sc=no]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[toggle title_open="Andrew Matangi, Consultant, Buddle Findlay, Member, CCANZ Legal Team" title_closed="Andrew Matangi, Consultant, Buddle Findlay, Member, CCANZ Legal Team" hide="yes" border="yes" style="default" excerpt_length="0" read_more_text="Read More" read_less_text="Read Less" include_excerpt_html="no"]Andrew began by pointing out that everyone produces and owns copyright works. The pictures on your phone, the emails to your mother, the embarrassing poems you wrote when you were in year 12 – all of these works qualify for copyright protection. Ordinarily, you, as creator, own the copyright to those works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you create the work in the course of your employment, then the copyright belongs to your employer. This means that the copyright to all teaching resources produced by teachers in the course of their employment as teachers is owned by the Board of Trustees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the BoT wanted to share teaching resources with other schools? It could say, 'here, use it.' From a lawyer’s perspective, though, this is imprecise. There might be a bunch of other things the board hasn't thought about, such as commercial reuse, attribution and liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's better, then, to use a standardised, legally robust licence, such as those provided by Creative Commons. It's more flexible, and provides protection for both you and the user. Andrew then ran through the Creative Commons licences, noting that the New Zealand licences were relatively clear and plain English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew ended his presentation by outlining New Zealand's limited 'fair dealing' exceptions. These exceptions do not offer hard and fast rules. Instead, the definition of 'fair' depends on the facts of an individual case, including the amount that is used, its impact on the market of a work, and the nature of the use in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[/toggle]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[toggle title_open="Keitha Booth, Programme Leader, NZ Open Government Information and Data Programme and Member, CCANZ Advisory Panel" title_closed="Keitha Booth, Programme Leader, NZ Open Government Information and Data Programme and Member, CCANZ Advisory Panel" hide="yes" border="yes" style="default" excerpt_length="0" read_more_text="Read More" read_less_text="Read Less" include_excerpt_html="no"]Keitha’s presentation introduced the New Zealand Government's policy on open data. As she pointed out, the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework supports the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector. NZGOAL provides a 'review and release process' that enables agencies to decide whether a work is suitable for release under an open licence. In the education sector, the Ministry of Education must use NZGOAL to release its copyright materials; schools and universities are encouraged to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why would they? Keitha argued that a Creative Commons policy is a way for BoTs to require teachers to use and create licensed materials. It's also a way to encourage students to use and create legally licensed materials. More broadly, the adoption of Creative Commons policies will make the education system in New Zealand more efficient and innovative, as teachers spend less time reinventing the wheel and more time sharing, collaborating and building on each other's work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools can do this by passing an open data policy – otherwise known as a Creative Commons IP policy – encouraging teachers to collaborate and share, rather than compete and duplicate efforts. This policy requires teachers to apply a Creative Commons Attribution licence when sharing resources, and use a 'no known copyright' statement if releasing a work has fallen out of copyright. Keitha finished her presentation by pointing to an open licence used by Te Ara – The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand. She also pointed to the vast amount of works available through Flickr and many other repositories searchable through CC search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[toggle title_open="Ian Munro, Ministry of Education" title_closed="Ian Munro, Ministry of Education" hide="yes" border="yes" style="default" excerpt_length="0" read_more_text="Read More" read_less_text="Read Less" include_excerpt_html="no"]Ian Munro began his presentation by pointing out that there is a wide range of attitudes to sharing resources across the teaching profession. On the one hand, some teachers are protective of their resources, or lack confidence in their quality; on the other hand, many teachers are more than happy to share resources with anyone who asks. As new technologies and pedagogies arise, Ian argued that more and more teachers will become interested in sharing and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When teachers begin to share resources, however, they have to confront the fact that, under the Copyright Act, their resources are owned by their Board of Trustees. This presents a significant hurdle to the sharing of digital resources, one that is most effectively addressed by adopting a Creative Commons IP policy at every school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ian explained, IP was one of the issues faced by the MoE as it looked to source teaching resources for schools after the February 2011 Canterbury earthquake. Many schools found themselves unable to access their resources, which were either destroyed or stuck in unsafe buildings. In response, the MoE asked many of New Zealand's top performing schools to provide subject area resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not as easy as it sounds. Some schools, for instance, were keen to ensure that the resources wouldn't be made to other schools. Other schools thought that it was a great opportunity to develop a online repository for teaching resources, and were more than happy to oblige. But even schools that were happy to oblige found that their files had no clear metadata attached, including no standardised naming schema, file organisation or file formats. This made it incredibly difficult for outsiders to find the resources they needed.&lt;/p&gt;

The portal is also a great reason for schools to adopt a Creative Commons policy, as it is going to make it much easier to find and share resources. Pond will act as a safe online environment for educators to share and collaborate, but it will require schools to clarify their positions on Intellectual Property, as it will be both the teacher's responsibility to ensure that they have permission to legally share content. Note: Carolyn was unable to share her slides, but you can read more about the N4L portal -- recently dubbed Pond -- &lt;a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/pond/" target="_blank"&gt;at their homepage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A colleague asked to borrow the resource, and Stephen, in the spirit of collegiality, said yes, at which point the colleague proceeded to sell the resource to a publishing company. Stephen, hoping for royalties, complained to the principal, who pointed out that it was the school that owned the rights to the resource – and that it was the school that would be collect any royalty payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are, Stephen said, is an age of connectivity, and we are sharing more than ever. And teachers share as much as anyone, remixing and reusing resources to fit the needs of individual classrooms. New Zealand has also emerged beyond the competitive, contestable funding approach; with the recent development of Learning and Change Networks and collaboration on ICT, schools are increasingly being expected to share best practice with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important, then, that Boards of Trustees acknowledge that this is an age of sharing and collaboration – even when the professional instincts of BoT members, who may come from corporate backgrounds, are to commercialise educational resources produced at the school. This drive towards sharing and collaboration needs to be based in the vision of the school. At Taupaki, this vision was developed by the teachers and local community – without input from Stephen himself. This vision was included a desire to encourage collaboration , and this was a core part of Stephen’s sales pitch to the BoT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen submitted a discussion document to the BoT, and drew on these parts of their vision, as well as the potential for sharing in the Network for Learning, and it was passed just before Stephen went on study leave. But the implementation will be the challenge, and it is still early days. As Stephen said, quoting Friere, “ideas that are acquired with ease are discarded with ease.”&lt;/p&gt;

A policy that enabled and encouraged sharing and collaboration was a great fit with the vision of the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting David Wiley, Mark argued that sharing and collaboration is fundamental to education: "without sharing, there is no education." However, Mark also pointed out that openness is a new concept for many, including members of the Board of Trustees who may come from a commercial background. This meant that the policy required a shift in mental models. Instead of the 'see-saw' metaphor -- whereby a gain for one is a loss for the other -- Mark advocated a shift to a 'rising tide' metaphor, whereby sharing and collaboration benefits everyone, including those doing the sharing and collaborating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then pointed out several concrete examples of sharing communities, including the VLN and Wikieducator, where ASHS has had an active presence for many years. Mark concluded by discussing into other forms of openness, such as open software and open hardware, arguing that schools should be wary of locking their students into closed applications run by off-shore multi-nationals. Instead, schools should explore the range of free and open alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard White is an interesting example of an artist using CC to make his own creative output available, while working in a job that clearly demonstrates the pitfalls and possibilities of copyright and open access day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard has made two of his albums available for download on Bandcamp, &lt;a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;under the name Mermaid Guitar&lt;/a&gt;. He began by offering his earlier album, &lt;a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/album/me-for-a-day" target="_blank"&gt;‘Me for a Day’&lt;/a&gt;, with a five dollar price tag, and then decided to offer ‘Barry Starr’ for free, with the “name your price” function, where users choose how much they’d like to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being available for free, the second album has had more downloads &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; more sales -- so he’s now offering the earlier album under the same terms. For Richard, this makes the process of selling an album more exciting. As he puts it, “People have paid a lot more than I thought they might, more than the five dollars I initially offered the first album for."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2754915517 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of others have downloaded his music for free, but Richard says that he’s totally happy with this. “Ultimately I just like the idea that someone’s listening to my music on their iPod on the other side of the world”. But he’s also careful to point out that he doesn’t try to make a living from his music and concedes that, for those who do, there are greater challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the production process, Richard sourced all artwork for ‘Barry Starr’ from Public Domain or CC sources, but he says finding images which could be used with the CC BY SA licence he used for the album, which also fit his purpose, was trickier than he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were some great images I really liked, but they had either ND or, more commonly, NC," Richard says. "Given that people could pay, I couldn’t use NC. I guess the difficulty I had finding good stuff showed me that open access is still at the ‘evangelical’ stage in many respects and we need more converts for it to become more self-sustaining”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2754915517 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By day, Richard works as Copyright Officer at the University of Otago, addressing any copyright issues or questions encountered by staff and research students there. This can be a challenge: while most staff have an understanding of the broad concepts of copyright, it can be a complex web of legislation, licences and rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard has found himself a staunch advocate of open access in the tertiary sector and CC as the main vehicle for that. “CC licences simplify a lot of things from a copyright point of view”, he says. “Often a staff member or a PhD student will come to me or one of our library staff with questions about permission for something they want to use in a piece of research. One of the most common problems is that they just don’t hear from someone they’ve contacted to get permission”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says a lot of the time accessibility is the last thing researchers and academics are thinking about. They’re  used to things being done a certain way and aren’t necessarily aware of the open access alternatives. Their reputations as academics are affected by how often they’re being published in scholarly journals, and the quality of those journals is taken into account too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the major roadblock for open access publications, just getting enough visibility and usage to attract good quality research, to gain a name as a good journal, not just an open access journal. I mean, I’d love it if all research was open”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2765089846 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other countries are mandating that all publicly funded research should be open -- the U.S. Government, for example -- but New Zealand isn’t making any moves yet. Instead academics do their research, write it up, submit it for publication, go through the peer review process, and are accepted into these big journals where they’re published, which universities around the world then pay subscription fees to access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appreciates the freedom Creative Commons licences give both creator and reuser, academic and artistic. “When someone has used a CC licence they’ve declared up front what they’re happy for others to do with their work. So part of my work is helping people understand the implications of their choices with their own work as part of the knowledge ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In that respect it’s no different from choosing CC in an artistic medium: you’re sharing your work for others to use and build on.  I can’t claim that my music has informed great cultural achievements but there are people who’ve put it in compilations or used it in their films, which is immensely satisfying”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last week, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been running &lt;a title="Creative Commons Workshops" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schools"&gt;free ‘CC in Schools’ workshops&lt;/a&gt; across the country. Later in the week, we’ll post slides, audio and summaries of each of the speakers, as well as the issues raised in the lively Q&amp;amp;As that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With support from &lt;a href="https://internetnz.net.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;InternetNZ&lt;/a&gt;, these workshops talked about how a growing number of New Zealand schools are using CC licensing to share their teaching resources. Resource sharing, of course, isn’t new: everyday, teachers share countless resources across a range of vibrant professional networks, from the &lt;a href="http://www.vln.school.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;VLN&lt;/a&gt; to subject-area email lists. For the most part, though, resource sharing among teachers is necessarily informal. It often takes place in the form of email attachments, without licensing or metadata attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that other teachers, who may be new to the profession -- or who may simply not be part of that specific conversation or network – tend to miss out. They may, as a result, end up having to reinvent that resource later on, which gives them less time for the many, many other things teachers have do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice, then, if New Zealand had a central, searchable repository of properly labelled and openly licensed teacher-made resources. (If you’re not sure we need such a repository, check out the site visits at&lt;a href="http://maths.nayland.school.nz/" target="_blank"&gt; Nayland College's excellent Maths portal&lt;/a&gt; (soon to be CC-licensed!) – it’s had over &lt;i&gt;1.28 million&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the &lt;a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/portal/" target="_blank"&gt;Network for Learning portal&lt;/a&gt; looks set to help meet this demand. While the portal is still in beta, it has the capacity to allow teachers to find and reuse free and open resources from the entire New Zealand teaching community. This would mean that teachers, including those new to teaching, could spend less time reinventing the wheel, and more time adapting quality resources for their individual classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. But the barriers to sharing resources are not only technical – they’re legal. Under &lt;a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345930.html" target="_blank"&gt;section 21 of the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994&lt;/a&gt;, where an employee makes copyright works “in the course of his or her employment [...] that person's employer is the first owner of any copyright in the work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do? The so&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SRR-Legally.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-5229 alignleft" alt="SRR Legally" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SRR-Legally.png" width="249" height="255"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;lution for many New Zealand schools is a &lt;a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons IP policy&lt;/a&gt;, approved by a school’s BoT. This policy gives teachers permission in advance to share resources under an open Creative Commons licence. This means that teachers can legally make the most of online resource sharing portals, such as the Network for Learning (or &lt;a href="http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page" target="_blank"&gt;Wikieducator&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such policies are also supported by the &lt;a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework&lt;/a&gt;, approved by Cabinet in 2010. This framework instructs core agencies – like the Ministry of Education – to consider using Creative Commons licences when releasing copyright works. Happily, NZGOAL also encourages Boards of Trustees to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why use a CC licence? Simply put, an open licence gives others teachers clarity about what they can do with your work and how you wish to be credited. As Andrew Matangi – who had a big hand in writing the CC licences -- pointed out in the workshops, the licences are also legally robust, which means that you don’t need to worry about issues like liability. (Andrew’s example was a malfunctioning science experiment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the more open CC licenses also allow the creation of ‘derivative’ works – that is to say, these licences let you adapt and improve the works. As every teacher knows, this is crucial, as even the best resources need to be tweaked or remixed for the unique challenges of individual classrooms. Simply put, digital technologies make remix easy; CC licences make remix legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds quite legalistic, but the primary effects of a CC policy – as Stephen Lethbridge and Mark Osborne both pointed out – are &lt;i&gt;cultural&lt;/i&gt;. Stephen and Mark’s CC policies were passed to support their schools’ desire to be collaborative, open and networked places, where teachers and students share, make and innovate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Creative Commons</category><category>Education</category><category>Events</category><guid>http://ccanz.org.nz/posts/2014/03/18/sharing-collaboration-and-copyright.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2014 23:52:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
