&lt;p&gt;So far at academic institutions, promoting Open Access has been seen primarily as a library concern, and reporting for the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) primarily as being in the realm of the research office. But by working together there are a number of ways that Open Access and PBRF reporting can benefit each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits of Open Access to the PBRF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious benefit for the institution is the &lt;a title="SPARC" href="http://sparceurope.org/oaca/" target="_blank"&gt;well-known citation advantage&lt;/a&gt; for papers available by either gold Open Access ("born" Open Access) or green Open Access (a version of the canonical toll-access paper is deposited in an OA repository). To the extent that PBRF scores depend on institutions being able to demonstrate the impact of their research, this citation advantage is worth money. Likewise, Open Access publications can raise the profile of early career researchers especially, opening up opportunities for national and international collaboration -- another factor that can demonstrate peer esteem for the researcher as PBRF portfolios are assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benefit to the PBRF process comes when considering the arduous tasks of output verification (within the institution) and auditing (at the national level). Verification is a painfully manual process of searching for each output to obtain evidence of its existence -- an official pdf from the publisher's website is preferred -- and confirm citation details. A well-established history of indexing makes citations for most journal articles fairly trivial to locate. But for disciplines where books and chapters are more common, or for researchers whose portfolios rely on conference papers, even tracking down the citation details can be an involved process -- or impossible, several years after a conference has removed them from its website. If these outputs were available Open Access, they would be far more quickly found, and untold hours of valuable staff time saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/researchlock.png"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-96" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/researchlock-300x222.png" alt="researchlock" width="300" height="222"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits of the PBRF to Open Access&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With this vast investment of staff hours in mind, many institutions attempt to merge the processes of verifying outputs for the PBRF and filling the institutional repository (IR). This might be done by manually forwarding metadata with located pdf fulltext to IR staff, or by an integrated system gathering and sharing metadata and fulltext in common. Provided author permission can be obtained, &lt;a title="Sherpa" href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/" target="_blank"&gt;publisher policies are amenable&lt;/a&gt;, and/or an institutional mandate applies, this can be very successful at increasing the amount of literature available Open Access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are limitations. Metadata requirements differ for the different purposes. Worse, PBRF verification typically requires the published version of a paper, which copyright generally precludes the institutional repository from reproducing; whereas the institutional repository will often need an author's version, which is useless for verification purposes. One blunt solution can be to encourage researchers to submit all versions of their paper, and let support staff sort out which ones are needed where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowing all the benefits that Open Access provides for PBRF reporting and the resulting funding can make it easier to advocate for researcher and management support of Open Access initiatives. These might include advising researchers of high-impact Open Access journals in their fields that they could be publishing in; supporting the costs of Article Processing Charnges (APC) where other funding is unavailable; or even &lt;a title="Harvard" href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/hoap/Good_practices_for_university_open-access_policies" target="_blank"&gt;implementing an Open Access mandate across the institution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboration between the library and research office -- and, if implementing a new system, IT services -- isn't trivial. Like a three-legged stool, all need to be equal partners, communicating and appreciating the quite different languages, cultures and priorities of each team. But then it opens up scope for future collaboration when we come to look at other mutually beneficial issues like research data and funding grants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conferences are where a huge amount of research gets its first public airing. And yet conference papers are notoriously hard to track down after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some conferences still publish their proceedings in print monographs; some on CD, DVD, or USB stick; an increasing number in special issues of journals. Some publish them on websites that may or may not last beyond the year. Access may be limited to attendees or to database subscribers. Many don't publish at all, leaving it up to the author to remember and find the time to self-deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the Open Access movement has paid remarkably little attention to the potential of conference outputs. OpCit's open access citation advantage bibliography (now &lt;a href="http://sparceurope.org/oaca/"&gt;maintained by SPARC Europe&lt;/a&gt;) includes 32 papers sourced from conferences -- but only two &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; conferences. The Public Knowledge Project's conferences are full to the brim with papers about the use of Open Journal System (OJS), but not even every year do they have a single paper about &lt;a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/"&gt;Open Conference System&lt;/a&gt; (OCS). At least they make &lt;a href="http://ocs.sfu.ca/pkp/index.php"&gt;these papers Open Access&lt;/a&gt;, though. Many Open Access conferences don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/conference.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-462" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/conference-300x225.png" alt="Conference from OpenClipArt " width="300" height="225"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Conference from &lt;a title="OpenClipArt" href="https://openclipart.org/detail/50947/2010-02-06-12.03.15-by-rejon" target="_blank"&gt;OpenClipArt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this? Many argue that conference papers just aren't that valuable. They're not peer-reviewed (though some are) and often represent early results that will be further developed and presented formally in journals (though many aren't). Certainly they're cited less, but is this just a case of academic sour grapes: we can't find them so we say we never really wanted them anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have publishers, libraries and Open Access advocates ignored conferences because they're too hard -- or are they too hard because we've ignored them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we being responsible in withholding early and thus potentially unreliable results from the public, or are we being anti-democratic? If we care about public access to publicly funded research we should be asking these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we do? It's a big issue, but there are some obvious steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conference organisers&lt;/strong&gt;: Think about open publication of the papers and posters presented. There's heaps of software out there to help manage this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libraries&lt;/strong&gt;: If you support your academic community with OJS, look into whether there’d be interest in you supporting them with &lt;a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/"&gt;OCS&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors&lt;/strong&gt;: If the conference isn't publishing your paper, or doesn't have a clear plan for ongoing hosting, put it in your &lt;a href="http://www.opendoar.org/find.php"&gt;institutional repository&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.opendoar.org/find.php"&gt;disciplinary archive&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://figshare.com/"&gt;figshare&lt;/a&gt;, so researchers will be able to find (and cite) it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are only stop-gap solutions. In the long term what I think we really need is a global, multi-disciplinary archive for all conference outputs -- abstracts, papers, slides, posters, videos, hackathon code -- which may allow author self-deposit but whose main focus is on actively soliciting for bulk-deposit from entire conferences. If you agree (or disagree!) &lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/deborah.fitchett@lincoln.ac.nz"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;: this is a topic I'm continuing to research.&lt;/p&gt;
