&lt;p&gt;At Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, we are proud this year to be sponsoring the prizes for NZ school students for GIF IT UP 2015, which will be judged by GIF and comic artist &lt;a href="http://thewireless.co.nz/authors/toby-morris" target="_blank"&gt;Toby Morris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;GIF IT UP is a fun challenge coordinated by DigitalNZ and the Digital Public Library of America, which calls for the best GIFs created from copyright-free or openly licensed heritage material. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;GIF-makers can use any content they find via &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.digitalnz.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;digitalnz.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dp.la" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;dp.la&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and other international search services &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.europeana.eu" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;europeana.eu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trove.nla.gov.au" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;trove.nla.gov.au&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. This material must be licensed for reuse. For example, it must be:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;in the public domain,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;have a ‘no known copyright restrictions’ statement,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;or have a Creative Commons licence that allows for reuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;GIF IT UP 2015 will be judged by an international panel of judges: Tim Hwang from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://imgur.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Imgur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Rebecca Onion from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Slate Vault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and Alessandro Scali &amp;amp; Marco Calabrese from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://okkultmotionpictures.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Okkult Motion Pictures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, who will be awarding a &lt;a href="http://www.giphoscope.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Giphoscope&lt;/a&gt; to one supreme GIF IT UP winner, as well as other prizes to three runners up. The GIF with the most Tumblr “notes” will also receive a people’s choice award. You can browse entries to GIF IT UP from around the world at &lt;a href="http://gifitup2015.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"&gt;gifitup2015.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;. If you'd like to create a GIF and enter it, &lt;a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/gif-it-up" target="_blank"&gt;here's where you'll find all the information you need&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a rather lovely GIF that Thomasin Sleigh at DigitalNZ made specially for me: a demure lady from &lt;a href="http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;amp;cl=search&amp;amp;d=EP19260626.2.151.1.1" target="_blank"&gt;Papers Past&lt;/a&gt;. Readers of the monthly Creative Commons Aotearoa newsletter, which I write, will know that I am a total sucker for old drawings of ladies with parasols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lady2.gif"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-803 size-full" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lady2.gif" alt="Demure Papers Past lady GIF" width="348" height="831"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Evening Post, Volume CXI, Issue 151, 26 June 1926, Page 16.

&lt;p&gt;So far, so fun. But making and publishing these 'shortest of all stories' both requires and is a product of important technical and cultural shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Although based on existing artworks, GIFs are a new and original form of artistic expression. But, because they technically involve making copies of images, copyright law applies. This means that the artist is legally obliged to check the exact provenance, rights status and licence conditions of each image before using it -- and this is often almost impossible. Because of the unregistered nature of copyright, it can be incredibly difficult (and time-consuming) to track down the owner. And because of copyright’s long-lasting nature, even images that are several decades old, with long-dead creators, may still be in copyright.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This is all assuming that you even know that the image you want to use exists. Currently, most of New Zealand’s publicly funded or publicly housed cultural heritage is unavailable for reuse by New Zealanders. Despite ongoing digitisation projects, these works are often neither commercially available nor publicly reusable. This means that creators who want to build on the works of the past are either forced to reinvent the wheel or go through a difficult process of asking permission, even when the original works are publicly funded and publicly housed and the creators are long deceased.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news, though, is that this is changing. There's a lot more detail in our upcoming book, &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Revolution: Growing Creative Commons in Aotearoa&lt;/em&gt;, but, in short, &lt;a href="http://openglam.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open GLAM&lt;/a&gt; in NZ is on the rise and growing fast. Galleries, libraries, archives and museums around the country are doing the hard yards of figuring out what the copyright situation is with the items in their collections; whether and how best to digitise them; and how to manage copyright in the unpredictable terrain of the internet. It can be difficult, frustrating and time-consuming work; but it's important, because what's at stake is New Zealanders' relationships with their own history and taonga. I believe that the ability to discover, learn from and creatively reuse our nation's artworks and other treasures is vital to our understanding of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the conversations I'm often having with people is about how &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;something as seemingly dry as copyright licensing can have profound impacts on our society, culture and economy. If you're wondering how this might all work in practice in your workplace, we have heaps of &lt;a href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;free resources&lt;/a&gt; you can use, and I'm always up for a chat -- you can reach me on elizabeth@creativecommons.org.nz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots to think about -- and lots to do! In the meantime, you have until 21 November to get your Open GLAM on, Kiwi-styles, and enter GIF IT UP. Let me know how you get on, especially if there are parasols involved.&lt;/p&gt;

She has a degree in History and English and used to work for the Alexander Turnbull Library. When not at CCANZ, Elizabeth is a freelancer in the NZ publishing industry. She has an ongoing interest in the ways in which digital copyright licensing works -- or doesn't -- in the arts and heritage sectors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Elizabeth Heritage</category><category>Heritage</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/gif-it-up-2015.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2015 13:04:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Towards a Connected Commons</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/from-collecting-domains-to-a-connected-commons.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY SARAH POWELL&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade the conversation surrounding the reuse of digital collections from cultural heritage institutions has grown louder. The rise of digital technologies has created a friction between the traditional role of the museum, gallery, library or archive as gatekeepers and the expectations placed on them by users for immediate and openly available content. Furthermore, research suggests that the recent hype of Open GLAM and the application of Creative Commons licences to digital cultural material has seen many memory institutions rethinking their practices surrounding image reproductions and shifting away from traditional revenue models towards providing more open and freely accessible material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many cultural heritage institutions the practical aspect of applying Creative Commons licences to digital surrogates can be complicated. Most cultural heritage institutions do not own copyright of the works held in their collections and knowing how to gain permission from copyright owners to openly license digitised material can be challenging. At present, the majority of Creative Commons licensed images available from New Zealand cultural institutions are reproductions of out-of-copyright objects that have been photographed by the institution itself, such as &lt;a href="http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2014/06/03/free-downloadable-images-from-te-papas-collections/"&gt;Te Papa’s recently released CC images&lt;/a&gt;. So how can cultural heritage institutions confidently apply Creative Commons licences to digital content that is in copyright?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CC licensing is already commonplace within scholarly publications where many separate articles make up one journal. Prior to publication each author signs a contract and gives their permission for a Creative Commons licence to be applied to their work.  Applying this method to digital collections cultural heritage institutions can offer a Creative Commons licence option through copyright licence agreements, donor agreements and other licensing instances. Starting the conversation about openly licensed works early in the donation process with donors can be a simple way of explaining the purpose of Creative Commons licensing and save valuable time and resources. &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/11/recollect-upper-hutt-city-library/"&gt;Upper Hutt City Library’s RECOLLECT&lt;/a&gt; is a great example of licensing content from multiple authors with a Creative Commons licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, complex situations arise when the collecting institution is not the rights holder and the work is an orphan work or where the work is classed as an indigenous work. Both of these situations require further investigation and current practice within the cultural heritage sector is to only apply Creative Commons licences to works with clear copyright owners. Applying Creative Commons licences to works where the author is unknown or to an indigenous work is considered inappropriate and potentially illegal.  At present, focusing on opening up content that has a clear copyright owner, or is deemed to be in the public domain, is the best option for cultural heritage institutions looking to provide openly reusable content for the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Turnbull Library Record Digitisation Project&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a placement towards a Masters of Museum and Heritage Studies at Victoria University, I have been working on a rights management plan for a special project at the Alexander Turnbull Library. They are planning to digitise and publish online all issues of the &lt;i&gt;Turnbull Library Record&lt;/i&gt; from 1940 onwards and make them available for reuse with a Creative Commons licence. The Turnbull Library Record was created by the Friends of the Turnbull Library in 1940 and is an incredibly rich source that brings to life manuscripts, archives, photographs and artworks within the Alexander Turnbull Library collection. This exciting project forms part of the Alexander Turnbull Library’s 100 year anniversary celebrations due to be held in 2020. The decision to release the digital surrogates of the Turnbull Library Record with a CC-BY licence has been made in accordance with the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/government/"&gt;New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework (NZGOAL)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ATL-002-TLR-Dust-jacket-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-559 size-large" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ATL-002-TLR-Dust-jacket-1-725x1024.jpg" alt="Turnbull Library Record cover" width="725" height="1024"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Turnbull Library Record Cover Image, 2013: Staged running race in studio, taken for Dormer-Beck Advertising LTD 1973. Photographer: K E Niven and Co, fl 1940s-1970s (ATL ref. F-241030-1/2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My role consists of researching and collating information on authors who have contributed articles to the Turnbull Library Record right from the first issue in 1940. Each author who has contributed an article to the TLR will be contacted for copyright purposes and sent a copyright licence agreement that offers the suggested Creative Commons licence option. While authors retain the right to choose a traditional copyright licence, we are encouraging authors to consider the option of licensing their work under a CC licence. By openly licensing each article within each issue of the Turnbull Library Record, this will allow new audiences to discover an internationally recognised and acclaimed publication in its entirety and help set a precedent for future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Alexander Turnbull Library will be contacting contributors to the Turnbull Library Record shortly for copyright purposes and would appreciate any authors who have contributed works to the Turnbull Library Record to contact Fiona Oliver, Curator New Zealand and Pacific Publications at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:fiona.oliver@dia.govt.nz"&gt;&lt;i&gt;fiona.oliver@dia.govt.nz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;  with their current details.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the month of March (and a little bit of April), Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been travelling around Aotearoa spreading the word about open access and open licensing for local Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM). In case you didn't make it to any of these events, we've embedded a video of one of the sessions plus the slides below, along with a short summary of what they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgNF5HZTBsU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Matt McGregor and Elizabeth Heritage, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Elizabeth began by introducing Creative Commons licensing in Aotearoa New Zealand. They then noted that, while new technologies had provided heritage organisations new opportunities to share their digital collections for reuse, copyright and licensing was still a significant barrier. Usage rights statements, they said, were often vague, overly restrictive and not standardised across the sector. They then ran through three specific recommendations, outlined in the slides, before giving a brief introduction to the licences themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702250" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Keitha Booth, New Zealand Open Government Information and Data Programme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keitha introduced the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework, which advocates for the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector. Keitha noted that the Open Government Data and Information Programme had expanded its focus to local government. She outlined the NZGOAL adoption process, and the policy framework for each institution, both of which are detailed in the slides below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702435" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Victoria Leachman, Rights Advisor, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria outlined Te Papa's experiences with Creative Commons licensing, beginning with the Rita Angus podcasts in 2008. Victoria noted that CC licensing these podcasts had enabled them to be used by other institutions touring the exhibition -- without Te Papa having to write detailed usage agreements. After running through several other CC projects, Victoria discussed the download project, which has so far released over 48,000 images for free high-resolution download. Victoria noted that usage was much greater than predicted at the beginning of the project, and that it was being used for a range of purposes. Victoria closed her presentation by outlining the challenges to open access and open licensing for the GLAM sector, and highlighting the approach taken in response to these challenges thus far by Te Papa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702446" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager, DigitalNZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After introducing DigitalNZ and its mission, Thomasin showed the famous 'magic hat' diagram, which outlines how content from individuals and organisations around New Zealand is harvested by the DigitalNZ and made more easily searchable by the aforementioned magic hat (otherwise known as the DigitalNZ API). She then gave an overview of DigitalNZ's approach to rights, and pointed out some of the common issues faced by DigitalNZ as it attempts to provide clear rights information to end users. Thomasin argued that the point of working through these rights issues was to help produce "a world in which our shared cultural heritage is open to all, regardless of their background. A world in which people are no longer passive consumers of cultural content created by an elite, but contribute, participate, create and share." Thomasin concluded with several standout local and international open GLAM case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702442" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader, Alexander Turnbull Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark began by noting that the internal debates around use and reuse within the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa repeated debates that are taking place in society at large. Many of the issues around reusing collection items were difficult, and many of them turned on the notion of trust. Mark then noted that rights statements across the sector were inconsistent, and that the National Library of New Zealand had developed a set of policy principles to address this inconsistency, which are outlined in the slides. Implementation, he said, was ongoing, though three issues currently being addressed were donor and depositor agreements, a flowchart to guide the release process, and improving the rights statements and licensing on indigenous knowledge works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702437" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Allison Brown, Digital Services Coordinator, University of Otago Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison discussed the use of Creative Commons licensing within the University of Otago library. In particular, she gave her experience in discussing CC licensing with rights holders, applying CC licensing in a library context, supporting the use of CC by others, managing the use of CC and promoting CC to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702434" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is re-posted from &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog" target="_blank"&gt;the Creative Commons International blog&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for Asia Pacific Regional Coordinator Jessica Coates for the editorial assistance!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the first of a series of blog posts focusing on our global activities, Matt McGregor tells us of exciting developments in CC in New Zealand Aotearoa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 has been a busy year for the commons in Aotearoa. After a few years of relatively slow progress, many of New Zealand’s public institutions have started to adopt open policies. So many, in fact, that we’ve decided to launch an entire website, &lt;a href="http://http://nzcommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;NZCommons.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to discussing the opportunities and challenges of opening New Zealand’s culture and knowledge for access and reuse. With a particular focus on copyright, licensing and the public domain, the NZCommons site aims to help cross-pollinate and energise the various open groups in New Zealand, who are all doing excellent work, though too often in isolation from one another. The site will have news, case studies and a range of pieces from New Zealanders working to grow the commons, supporting and encouraging the many individuals and institutions working to adopt CC licensing across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what a lot there is to be discussed. I’ve already mentioned some of the developments being highlighted on NZCommons in my &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/43758"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; to this blog about Creative Commons policies being passed in New Zealand schools, now up to the rate of around one per week. But the increased adoption of CC licensing hasn’t been limited to schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, both the &lt;a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz" target="_blank"&gt;University of Waikato&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz" target="_blank"&gt;University of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; passed open access mandates requiring all research published within their respective institutions to be uploaded to the library’s repository, enabling research to be made openly available as soon as possible. In so doing, they joined &lt;a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Lincoln University&lt;/a&gt; in paving the way for open access policies at other New Zealand research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, in the middle of the year, we saw three big developments in the heritage sector. First, the &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz" target="_blank"&gt;National Library of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; passed their excellent &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/blog/posts/our-new-use-and-reuse-policy"&gt;use and reuse policy&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a clear framework for opening up the library’s collections. Under the policy, out-of-copyright works will be clearly labelled as such, which has not generally been the case in the sector; also, in-copyright works that are owned by the library will be made available under a Creative Commons licence. Our &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/11/national-librarys-new-use-reuse-policy/" target="_blank"&gt;case study of this policy has been up on NZCommons for a few weeks now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Te Papa&lt;/a&gt;, the Museum of New Zealand followed this announcement by &lt;a href="http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2014/06/03/free-downloadable-images-from-te-papas-collections/" target="_blank"&gt;releasing over 30,000 high resolution images&lt;/a&gt; under either a no-known copyright or a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives licence&lt;/a&gt; — a figure that has since approached 40,000. As it happens, we published a &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/te-papas-openly-licensed-images/" target="_blank"&gt;case study about Te Papa&lt;/a&gt; recently, as well. Since that release, Te Papa have signalled that they will shortly remove the ‘ND’ restriction from their licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;WW100&lt;/a&gt; team, announced that as part of New Zealand’s commemorations of the Centenary of World War I, the &lt;a href="https://natlib.govt.nz/collections/a-z/alexander-turnbull-library-collections" target="_blank"&gt;Turnbull Library&lt;/a&gt; was openly releasing the H Series of photographs taken during by New Zealand’s official photographer, Henry Armytage Sanders. As Melanie Lovell-Smith points out in a &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/photographing-new-zealanders-at-war" target="_blank"&gt;detailed background piece&lt;/a&gt;, these photographs are “the most comprehensive visual record of New Zealanders on the Western front from 1917 to 1918.” Other GLAM projects, such as the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/11/marsden-online-archive/" target="_blank"&gt;Marsden Online project&lt;/a&gt;, are also starting to use CC licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting things about these announcements is the best practice implementation by each of the institutions. Although all of them use their own method, all of the photos are clearly marked as being available to download and free of copyright restrictions, with a detailed and easily accessible description of what you can and can’t do with the image (see pictured). Te Papa even allows you to use copyright status as a search term. This level of transparency when it comes to copyright is essential to unlocking the value of our national collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other open projects — such open government data, open textbooks in higher education and legal tools for indigenous knowledge — are also progressing quickly. Working with Susy Frankel and Aroha Mead from &lt;a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz" target="_blank"&gt;Victoria University of Wellington&lt;/a&gt; and CC Panel Member Karaitiana Taiuru, the local Creative Commons team is working on developing an indigenous knowledge notice that will help Māori creators, iwi (tribe) and hapū (sub-tribe) to release their works more openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the government data sector, &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz" target="_blank"&gt;Land Information New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have released truly massive — and massively interesting — open datasets, including detailed aerial photography of the entire country and &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/news/2014-03/3d-models-released-christchurch-city" target="_blank"&gt;3D models of Christchurch before September 2010&lt;/a&gt;. These openly licensed models can be adapted and 3D printed by anyone, to help remember the heritage that was lost in the earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these projects will add an enormous amount of high quality copyright works to the commons, making it easier to access and reuse the works produced and held by New Zealand’s public institutions. These releases promise to save time and money for both the organisations involved and the public. They will also enable others to adapt and build on existing works, which means that fewer people will have to — excuse the cliche — reinvent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news, then. But these projects are only the beginning: there are thousands of other schools, heritage and research institutions with millions of copyright works that could be made openly available to the public for sharing and reuse. This could fundamentally change how New Zealanders access and engage with their culture and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to happen, these sectors are going to need some help. To help out, we’re developing toolkits — remixing some resources and platforms developed by HQ, and making a bunch of our own — that organisations can use to open their works for reuse. These toolkits will include an introductory paper, brochures, articles, sample policies and examples of best practice from New Zealand and around the world. We’re hoping to launch them at the National Digital Forum in Wellington in late November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the toolkits, though, we’re going to need much more open discussion and analysis on copyright, licensing and reuse — especially in the heritage sector, where copyright issues can be very complicated, and where there isn’t nearly enough information and discussion available online. NZCommons is designed to prompt that discussion. With it we hope to build momentum and support for more open policy across the country, and help realise the potential of the commons in Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Data</category><category>Education</category><category>Heritage</category><category>Matt McGregor</category><category>Research</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/busy-year-commons-aotearoa.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2014 08:58:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Marsden Online Archive CC licensed</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/marsden-online-archive-cc-licensed.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title="University of Otago Library" href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/" target="_blank"&gt;University of Otago Library&lt;/a&gt; has&lt;a title="Press release" href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/%20http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/otago082148.html" target="_blank"&gt; launched a new online archive&lt;/a&gt; that for the first time allows researchers to search and mine &lt;a title="Samuel Marsden" href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/%20http://marsdenarchive.otago.ac.nz/about/marsden" target="_blank"&gt;Samuel Marsden&lt;/a&gt;’s historic journals and letters with technological online tools. The documents, detailing life on the nation’s first missions, were brought back from London more than a century ago by &lt;a title="Hocken Library" href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/library/hocken/" target="_blank"&gt;Thomas Hocken&lt;/a&gt; and have been transcribed by Retired Associate Professor Gordon Parsonson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FkHtwbb6U3c" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the&lt;a title="Marsden Archive" href="http://marsdenarchive.otago.ac.nz/home" target="_blank"&gt; Marsden Archive website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was a collaborative project undertaken by the University of Otago Library and the University’s Centre for Research on Colonial Culture. This project to create the Marsden Online Archive set out to achieve a number of objectives including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Creating digital objects from historically significant, unique, items in the Hocken Collections.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Providing appropriate metadata for these resources, so to enrich contextual information and extend discoverability.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Identifying and deploying appropriate technical and discovery standards to ensure accessibility, preservation and curation.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Developing an appropriate platform, structure and web interface to make the collections useful as a research asset.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanessa Gibbs, Business Analyst and Mining Marsden Project Manager at the University of Otago Library, speaks about the use of Creative Commons in the Mining Marsden Project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Project Sponsor for the Marsden Online Archive was already familiar with Creative Commons licensing. He recommended the use of the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 New Zealand (&lt;a title="Licences explained" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/"&gt;CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 NZ&lt;/a&gt;) licence to Gordon Parsonson (the copyright owner of the transcripts). We chose that particular licence because we wanted to make sure Gordon would continue to get attribution for his work, but we didn’t want to stop other researchers being able to build upon the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From there it was an easy decision to use the same agreement for the digital images and metadata. The Creative Commons licence structure provides a clear and easily understood framework for the application of copyright licences. It was easy for us to apply the licence and it is easy for our users to understand the terms under which they can use the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we are using the same licence for both the transcripts and the images and metadata, we have set up a&lt;a title="Terms of use" href="http://marsdenarchive.otago.ac.nz/terms" target="_blank"&gt; terms of use webpage&lt;/a&gt;. Here we detail when Gordon needs to be attributed and when the Hocken Collections needs to be attributed. This way there is no confusion for our users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had really great buy-in from staff on the Marsden Online Archive. They are now more open to using a Creative Commons licence for other material. I guess they see Marsden as a test case for using a CC licence and so far it has been very successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are already a number of other projects that Library staff are discussing using Creative Commons licensing for. Hopefully the success of the Marsden Online Archive will highlight the usefulness of the CC licensing framework.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Elizabeth Heritage</category><category>Heritage</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/marsden-online-archive-cc-licensed.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2014 12:32:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The National Library's New Use &amp; Reuse Policy</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/nlnz-reuse-policy.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 20th 2014, the National Library of New Zealand (NLNZ) Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/blog/posts/our-new-use-and-reuse-policy" target="_blank"&gt;published its new use and reuse policy&lt;/a&gt;. In nine overarching principles, the policy aims to provide clarity and consistency around the use and reuse of the Library’s collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with international ‘&lt;a title="Open GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/openglam/" target="_blank"&gt;open GLAM&lt;/a&gt;’ recommendations, principle four advises that 'negotiations with rights owners and donors will promote and be informed by the Creative Commons licensing framework as a mechanism to facilitate use and reuse of in-copyright works.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principle five states that 'where no copyright restriction applies, NLNZ will seek to provide the items for use and reuse with a statement of "no known copyright restrictions", after careful consideration of cultural and ethical issues relating to the items.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other principles address the use of appropriate resolution size, the &lt;a href="https://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/detailed-nzgoal-factsheet/" target="_blank"&gt;Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework&lt;/a&gt;, and the treatment of ‘orphan’ works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader at the Alexander Turnbull Library at the National Library of New Zealand, first drafted the policy in early 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he points out, “The purpose of the policy is to be able to have a consistent framework across the NLNZ for all of our reuse activities, from supply to management to delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the supply side -- such as our negotiations and agreements with publishers and donors -- the policy attempts to clarify what we say about reuse, and the metadata we use, as early in the process as possible. On the delivery side, the policy covers clear and consistent statements, resolution, and also trying to get the Library to have more items available under 'no known copyright' restrictions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark notes that the initial conversations between the institution and the donor are critical, as this is where conditions around the reuse of collections items are formed. These conditions “flow through the entire life of the collection while it’s with us, which is in perpetuity," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why principle four advises that 'negotiations with rights owners and donors will promote and be informed by the Creative Commons licensing framework.' As part of the implementation of the principle, the Library is likely to add a Creative Commons tick-box on the donor form, and provide donors with a range of explanatory resources. Donors will retain the right to restrict access to their work, if they so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passage of the use and reuse policy took around eighteen months. “It was a series of conversations. It was important that we took our time and listened. The different perspectives in society around use and reuse -- which can be a relatively contentious issue -- also exist in the Library itself. As an institution, we just talked our way through these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a collecting institution, we managed to get a general agreement as to the purpose of what we do: we develop collections, and make them accessible (including through digitisation), because we want people to use them. It was important to clarify that the accessibility and use concepts were different. That was a critical point for moving forward with the policy work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the policy has been adopted, the Library is working to implement its principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re now establishing our process for the 'no known copyright' test, supporting principle five in the policy. We have a process to identify which collections go through the test, which includes considering any cultural or ethical reasons to restrict reuse - but still provide access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of great people in the Library have worked hard to determine those cultural and ethical criteria. Some of this work is challenging those criteria, but it’s also reaffirming some of them. We haven’t yet determined all of the reasons to restrict reuse on a cultural basis, though the idea with the 'no known copyright test' is that we’ll be able to determine some of those criteria as we go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re also developing procedures to follow when some works are reused in a way that go against the restrictions set by the Library or by donors. This goes to that amorphous issue of trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/H513.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-412" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/H513.jpg" alt="Howitzer batteries in action at Spice Farm, 1918.

No known copyright restrictions)" width="700" height="508"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Howitzer batteries in action at Spice Farm, 1918. (Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association: New Zealand official negatives, World War 1914-1918. Ref: 1/2-013131-G. Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand. No known copyright restrictions)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Library is also undertaking to map the array of restrictions placed on works by its donors over the years, to ensure that online users are always made aware of these restrictions, while at the same time aiming for clear and consistent rights statements across the Library’s collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a title="NLNZ blog" href="http://natlib.govt.nz/blog/posts/our-new-use-and-reuse-policy" target="_blank"&gt;Mark wrote on the NLNZ blog&lt;/a&gt;, “It sounds simple but there are a lot of current, past, and future permissions and rights statements we have to be able to reflect, cutting across sizeable and diverse collections, in different systems with differing technological capability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NLNZ policy follows &lt;a title="Te Papa’s openly licensed images" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/te-papas-openly-licensed-images/" target="_blank"&gt;the release of nearly 40,000 high-resolution images by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa&lt;/a&gt;, under either a Creative Commons licence or a no-known-copyright statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark believes that other collecting institutions are likely to follow in the footsteps of Te Papa and NLNZ -- and other international institutions like the &lt;a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/" target="_blank"&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt; -- and is curious to see which approach other institutions take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While Te Papa and NLNZ share the same objectives -- i.e. getting no-known-copyright images in high resolution available online -- our approaches have differed slightly. Te Papa’s approach is more to release large numbers of images in order to demonstrate value, which is great, they’ve done a magnificent job. On the other hand, the Library took more of a policy approach to get our thinking and framework in place before implementing. I think both are relevant. It will be interesting to see how these approaches play out and what other institutions do. I think both Te Papa and the National Library have demonstrated useful paths forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first collection released by NLNZ under the policy is the ‘H series’ of photographs from World War One, which is, as &lt;a title="WW1 photographs" href="http://ww100.govt.nz/photographing-new-zealanders-at-war" target="_blank"&gt;Melanie Lovell-Smith points out&lt;/a&gt;, “the most comprehensive visual record of New Zealanders on the Western front from 1917 to 1918.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa has now made nearly forty thousand images freely downloadable from its &lt;a title="Collections Online Te Papa" href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Collections Online&lt;/a&gt; digital database, giving the public access to the highest-resolution images it can and opening the way for creative reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around twenty thousand of these images are ‘No Known Copyright’ but upwards of seventeen thousand have been licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) &lt;a title="Licences explained" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;licence&lt;/a&gt;. “This is just the start”, says Rights Advisor Victoria Leachman. “We’re constantly improving our database, constantly collecting, constantly digitising. At launch we released thirty thousand and we aim to make another fifteen thousand images available for download by the end of this financial year.” Releasing images of the collection for download is now a core part of the workflow of copyright assessment for Victoria. “It’s no longer a one-off project. It’s now a business-as-usual activity and providing the highest-resolution image file we can means much wider scope for potential reuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Te Papa’s engagement with issues of copyright, licensing and openness &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/" target="_blank"&gt;has been a long process&lt;/a&gt; and will continue to evolve. “We need to keep finding a balance between making images freely available and reuseable to benefit the public good and ensuring cost recovery so we astutely manage our taxpayer funding to help keep the museum going,” says Victoria. “We will continue to respond as Creative Commons grows as a movement within New Zealand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victoria’s philosophy throughout has been one of incremental change: “let’s iterate!” She says “GLAM professionals tend to be completists, even perfectionists, and this isn’t a project you’re ever going to be able to ‘finish’. One of the big messages I’m always trying to get across is to start with what you can do now, at the foot of the mountain. Don’t worry about what’s at the top. It might get solved as you go and, if it doesn’t, you can better concentrate on solving it when you get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project’s launch in June 2014 generated a lot of positive feedback for Te Papa, both nationally and internationally. There was a significant visitation spike to the Collections Online site. Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage &lt;a title="Press release" href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/AboutUs/Media/Pages/FreeAccessto30000HighResolutionImagesfromTePapasdigitalcollections.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Finlayson has recognised&lt;/a&gt; Te Papa’s efforts and said: “These images from the national collection are a fantastic resource for New Zealanders. The Government’s &lt;a title="NZGOAL" href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Access Licensing Framework&lt;/a&gt; cuts red tape, allowing the public to share and enjoy these thousands of images freely, as well as making them more readily available for use by professionals in the education, historical, cultural, and creative sectors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Another benefit of this work is the internal efficiency savings.” Victoria noted that Collections Online is used heavily by Te Papa’s own staff, and the new, clearer copyright and open licensing statements mean less confusion, less worry about inadvertently doing something illegal, and significantly less time taken up processing rights requests and queries. “Staff can cut straight through the necessary copyright bureaucracy and just do it themselves, if they need an image for a sign, say, or an e-newsletter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course the main benefit is the creative and collaborative potential that freely available public domain or out-of-copyright and CC-licensed works bestow. One example close to home is the creation of a new artwork for the &lt;i&gt;Ngā Toi Arts Te Papa&lt;/i&gt; exhibition: &lt;a title="Arts Te Papa" href="http://arts.tepapa.govt.nz/on-the-wall/knowledge-on-a-beam-of-starlight-panel-1/8015" target="_blank"&gt;“Knowledge on a beam of starlight”&lt;/a&gt;, a vinyl work by Kerry Ann Lee using found images. With Te Papa’s permission Lee used images downloaded from Collections Online in her artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s next for Creative Commons at Te Papa? “Now we need to analyse the results so far, so that we can keep improving.” Victoria wants to learn how people are using the images, and what effect the freely downloadable content is having on Te Papa’s image licensing business. She is also very focussed on spreading the word, and making sure that Kiwis know that their cultural treasures are emerging into the free digital domain. “Creative Commons is still really early days in New Zealand. We want people to know what’s available and how they can use these incredible treasures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Elizabeth Heritage</category><category>Heritage</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/te-papas-openly-licensed-images.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2014 08:20:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What CC means for your Gran (or Grandchild)</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/creative-commons-grandchild.html</link><dc:creator>CCANZ</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY MIKE RIVERSDALE&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every family has its story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we commemorate &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/"&gt;100 years of the beginning of World War 1&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of us are tracking down our grandparents stories, how the soldiers within in our families fought and died, how those back at home coped with the hardships and the many years of repercussions as the scars, both external and internal, came home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with these &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/life-100-years-ago"&gt;‘big event’ stories&lt;/a&gt;, we all have a myriad of everyday tales that we commonly think of as particular to ourselves, memories of days gone past and yarns to be recounted at family get-togethers. And of course we all have our recent stories: last year’s summer holiday, the kid’s birthday celebration and even that catch up with mates in the pub last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these stories go to make up the fabric of our families, our friendships and our whanau - without them we are indeed islands and, as we all know, “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man_Is_an_Island_(disambiguation)"&gt;No man is an island&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does Creative Commons licences have to do with this collection of stories spanning the generations in your family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of verbal histories (or in some cases myths and even our own family urban legends) we gain insight into our earliest stories from the &lt;a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Topic/7425"&gt;writings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Object/1436499"&gt;photographs&lt;/a&gt; and, if we’re lucky, film left behind by our ancestors. As time passes on, these artefacts enter the “&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/pdm"&gt;public domain&lt;/a&gt;" (also know as “no known copyright”) and come to possess, as we see in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LTCOLMalone"&gt;personal histories and stories&lt;/a&gt; being used in the World War 1 commemorations across the Internet, a sense of common / shared knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing Gran recall her childhood stories, during those fleeting times that she wants to tell us and we are old enough to listen, are special moments. But when we touch, see and hear from the artefacts of her days -- such as her father’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adkin_diary"&gt;diaries scribbled during the battles&lt;/a&gt; -- we are immediately connected in a far more visceral manner. We feel it as part of our own story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step sideways for second, we are all keenly aware, especially in times of emergency and hardship, that families that play together stay together. These communities of families are the coming together of stories shared across the whanau boundary as they build, one upon the other,  flowing across and through to make the very fabric of our society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stories are shared, the artefacts (diaries, cine film, video tapes, clothes, tapes) become the ‘facts’ upon which we all stand. Locking up these artifacts with individuals and inside families could slowly diminish our sense of society, community and shared being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, letting Gran’s artefacts go to the vagaries of the ‘marketplace’ is not something many of us feel comfortable with - these are OUR stories and we want them to be treasured and loved as much as we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/"&gt;Creative Commons licences&lt;/a&gt; allows us to think into the future, to place our own wishes upon our photos, to let future generations know how we’d like our stories to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may indeed want to reserve all rights and keep the diaries away from the commercial world. Others may want the great great grandchildren to know that the re-use of the 1970’s holiday film would be welcome as long as it wasn’t for monetary gain (that’s a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/"&gt;BY-NC&lt;/a&gt; licence).  In fact, most of use will choose different approaches for different artefacts - the diary is for certain eyes and not to be shared, the photos of beaches are for all to use however they want and in whatever manner and tools people have in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons licences allows all of us, including your Gran, to make a conscious and active choice - this is how our stories can be reused. And for your great grandchildren, or even your cousins third nephew twice removed, this allows them the freedom to take those memories and incorporate them into their own stories, creating a richer a deeper society for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"&gt;The Launch of WW100&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, New Zealand officially &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/the-week-we-went-to-war" target="_blank"&gt;commemorated the outbreak of World War One&lt;/a&gt; with, fittingly enough, both a 100-gun salute and a field of 100 white crosses on the Parliamentary lawn. The centenary is, rightfully, a big deal, and will be for the next four years. As the Ministry for Culture and Heritage's &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;lovely WW100 site&lt;/a&gt; points out, the events of 1914-1918 “touched nearly every New Zealand family, every community, school, workplace and club or group” in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, much of the New Zealand GLAM sector – that's Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums – has been busily working on ways to mark the centenary, both for its own sake, but also to draw attention to the depth and quality of our local heritage collections. The hub for these efforts is the aforementioned WW100 site, which provides a range of resources, including a nice new search filter for WW1 materials. The WW100 folks will also be organising events, activities and projects all over the country for the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H526.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-312" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/H526.jpg" alt="Moses, the donkey mascot of the New Zealand Army Service Company.

Ref: 1/2-013143-G. &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/records/22770890" target="_blank"&gt;Alexander Turnbull Library&lt;/a&gt;, Wellington, New Zealand. No known copyright restrictions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"&gt;Opening the 'H' Series&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the promise of the centenary is, of course, to help teach New Zealanders about the events that -- as many speeches and essays over the next four years will undoubtedly point out -- shaped them as a nation. To put this another way, the centenary promises to help remind New Zealanders that this is &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; history: regardless of whether one had family members in the war -- or even had family members in New Zealand -- the war shaped the kind of place that New Zealand became.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if the events are part of New Zealand's common heritage, then so too are many of the works from that era. Recognising this, some of the largest organisations in the local GLAM sector have been working to ensure that the most significant heritage items from the war are made openly available to everyone, free of all technical, price and legal restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particularly interesting example of this  is the efforts of the Alexander Turnbull Library – working in tandem with organisations across the culture and heritage sector – to release the 'H' series of WW1 photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H series are photographs taken by Henry Armytage Sanders, and they are, as Melanie Lovell-Smith points out in a detailed background piece, “the most comprehensive visual record of New Zealanders on the Western front from 1917 to 1918.” As Lovell-Smith points out, before 1917, New Zealand didn't have an official photographer – due to the expense -- which means that the only photographs before that date were those taken by the New Zealand troops themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/photographing-new-zealanders-at-war" target="_blank"&gt;The piece goes into much more fascinating detail&lt;/a&gt; about both Sanders and the H Series itself, including the circuitous route of the negatives – via the RSA – to the Alexander Turnbull Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest chapter in this long archival story is that the ATL has released digital reproductions of these photographs, in high resolution, with clear 'no known copyright' statements. This means that anyone, anywhere, can view, share, download and reuse the official record of New Zealand in World War One, without asking permission or paying a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows the passage of the &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/about-us/strategy-and-policy/collection-use-and-reuse-policy" target="_blank"&gt;National Library of New Zealand's Use and Reuse policy&lt;/a&gt; (mentioned by Richard earlier in the week), principle five of which asserts that “Where no copyright restriction applies, NLNZ will seek to provide the items for use and reuse with a statement of ‘no known copyright restrictions’, after careful consideration of cultural and ethical issues relating to the items.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/find-WW1-content" target="_blank"&gt;find the photographs through the WW100 website&lt;/a&gt;, and download them &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/photos?text=%22H+series+negatives%22" target="_blank"&gt;free of charge (and copyright restrictions) from the National Library’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"&gt;Opening more NZ GLAMs&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the release of the H Series is very exciting, it is just the latest in a run of Open GLAM developments. Beyond the publication of the National Library's open policy, &lt;a href="http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2014/06/03/free-downloadable-images-from-te-papas-collections/"&gt;Te Papa has also released&lt;/a&gt; over 30,000 open images under high resolution. 14,000 of these are made available under a Creative Commons BY-NC-ND licence; 17,000 have been released without any copyright restrictions whatsoever. This release by Te Papa has been several years in the making, as &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/te-papa-joins-commons/" target="_blank"&gt;our case study&lt;/a&gt;, written in 2012, makes clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These content releases and open policies will surely be the first of many. There are hundreds of heritage institutions in New Zealand, with many millions of high quality works. As these works are digitised -- as they have been for the last fifteen or so years -- it's important that they are released as free of price, technical and legal restrictions as possible, so that as many New Zealanders (and non-New Zealanders) as possible can access and engage with works from their own heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As was noted in some of the preliminary discussions behind the release of the H Series, New Zealand's culture and heritage sector does not have clear, standardised rights statements, and sometimes imposes additional price, legal or technical restrictions on the reuse of heritage works. Heritage institutions will need to adopt clear policies and processes to be, as Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager of DigitalNZ and the kiwi representative on the &lt;a href="http://openglam.org/working-group/" target="_blank"&gt;Open GLAM Working Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://openglam.org/2014/02/19/openglam-progress-and-potential-in-aotearoa-new-zealand/" target="_blank"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;, "clear, consistent, and open with our cultural collections."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few month, and leading up to the National Digital Forum in November, we at Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ will be doing our best to help out, mostly by producing standard resources for an Open GLAM toolkit. There are, happily, a heap of support for these policies from the sector itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In advance of that, though -- and to give you a sense of what is happening in New Zealand -- you might want to check out this detailed case study of the &lt;a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/how-the-rijksmuseum-opened-up-its-collection-a-case-study" target="_blank"&gt;Rijksmuseum,&lt;/a&gt; one of the world's leading open heritage institutions. While you're at it, you can also check out our (smaller) case study of &lt;a title="RECOLLECT: Upper Hutt City Library" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/recollect-upper-hutt-city-library/" target="_blank"&gt;Upper Hutt City Library, &lt;/a&gt;to show you what's already being done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 2009, we published &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2009/06/671/" target="_blank"&gt;a quick case study&lt;/a&gt; of NZ On Screen, which was then only two years old. With the launch of its sister site, Audio Culture, in 2013, we thought we'd take the opportunity to revisit both projects. Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ intern Hannah Mettner sat down with NZ On Screen Project Director Clarion Coughlan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/" target="_blank"&gt;NZ On Screen&lt;/a&gt; has provided online access to a wealth of New Zealand film, television and music video since 2008. From the outset they’ve used a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial&lt;/a&gt; licence for all the work they put into the site. While the video content belongs to the rightsholders, all the synopses, backgrounds and biographies relating to videos and people is licensed under CC. And this material is impressive in its scope and quality; the introductions to the collections, particularly, are personable as well as thorough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarion, the Project Director, talks about how they want to make the content &lt;i&gt;work&lt;/i&gt;; their aim is not to put everything they possibly can online, but rather to choose culturally significant pieces and give them space to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NZ On Screen is a curated website, carefully chosen and added to, and the context provided by the written material is crucial. Clarion says “rather than just publishing videos, we contextualise them through our writing. As NZ On Screen has been paid for by tax payers (via NZ On Air funding), it makes sense to make that writing available under Creative Commons: To give something back”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having that CC licensed work reused also serves as a useful advertising tool; when writers reuse their pieces on blogs or have them published elsewhere, and actors’ agencies reuse what is effectively a pre-written biography, the CC licence brings people back to the NZ On Screen website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps due to the popularity of NZ On Screen, May 2013 saw the launch of a sister project, &lt;a href="http://www.audioculture.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Audio Culture&lt;/a&gt; – the ‘noisy library of New Zealand music’. The site aims to address the ‘digital silence’ that has surrounded New Zealand music online, and to collect together the stories, multimedia and ephemera that have contributed to NZ music from the last 100 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AudioCulture kicked off with 250 pages of people, labels and scenes, all under searchable indexes, plus music, interviews and photographs, with another 300 pages following in the second year. It was certainly very well-received, gaining 25,000 page views in its first month live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the successful formula employed over at NZ On Screen, the music on the site is licensed by PPNZ Music Licensing and APRA/AMCOS and the images have been cleared with copyright owners, but the written content in Profiles, Stories, Labels and Scenes all falls under the CC-BY-NC licence. Like the written content on NZ On Screen, these pieces are not brief introductions; they are well-researched and in-depth, written by a wide variety of contributors, often with a personal connection to the subject, providing an extraordinary depth of context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Arts</category><category>Heritage</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/posts/nz-screen-audio-culture.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2014 08:49:37 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
