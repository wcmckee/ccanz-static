&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;As a member of the New Zealand book trade, as well as being the Communications Lead at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, I’m always on the look-out for stories of Kiwis licensing their books under Creative Commons. Recently I caught up with Ann Calhoun, whose ebook &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.artsandcraftsnz.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Arts &amp;amp; Crafts Design: "like yet not like" nature: sources for a New Zealand story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; is lic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;ensed under a Creative Commons &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) 4.0 New Zealand licence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Calhoun is an art historian and researcher. Initially working in the patent world, she retrained as an art historian, then worked at the Queen Elizabeth II Arts Council, the National Art Gallery, the City Gallery (Wellington) and did contract work for Te Papa. She published &lt;i&gt;The Arts &lt;/i&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;i&gt; Crafts movement in New Zealand &lt;/i&gt;(AUP 2000) and curated &lt;i&gt;Simplicity &lt;/i&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;i&gt; &lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;Splendour &lt;/i&gt;for the Christchurch Art Gallery (2004-5). She has written extensively about women’s history and arts and crafts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;The blurb to her book states: “Over decades of privileged study of the Arts &amp;amp; Crafts in New Zealand, I became aware of a body of beautiful designs on paper. Almost all were by women, almost all had never been realised on fabric or wallpaper or on any other media or end product, and most had never been exhibited or published. The purpose of the present study is to right this wrong.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ArtsandCraftsNZ_Ann_Calhoun_2015-Cover.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-823 size-large" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ArtsandCraftsNZ_Ann_Calhoun_2015-Cover-1024x768.jpg" alt="Ebook cover: Arts and Crafts Design by Ann Calhoun" width="1024" height="768"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ebook cover: Reverend Doris Tutill, Wisteria design suitable for embroidery, 1933, watercolour; Macmillan Brown Library, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand (photo: Karl Valpy, Christchurch). Licensed CC BY-NC-ND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ann’s book is &lt;a href="http://www.artsandcraftsnz.co.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;available as an ebook only&lt;/a&gt;. She says: “The ebook is 350 pages and over 300 images. Publication costs for a regular book would have been prohibitive for a decent print run. I wanted New Zealanders to recognise that their cultural history included an Arts &amp;amp; Crafts movement. In today’s visual culture an illustrated book has understandably more attractions than text alone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Ann chose to make her ebook available for free download under a CC BY-NC-ND licence so as many people as possible could read it. She says: “Licensing my book under Creative Commons was a ‘no-brainer’. I come from a background in patents and art history, and questions of copyright have always been of interest. CC means that younger and older audiences – anyone interested in design or the Arts &amp;amp; Crafts or almost anything! - can have easy access to the CC ebook. In every way, CC was an exciting option.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/James-Johnstone-table-lamp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-825 size-medium" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/James-Johnstone-table-lamp-176x300.jpg" alt="James Johnstone table lamp" width="176" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; James Johnstone (head of Design and Crafts at the Canterbury College School of Art from 1926 to 1958), “Table Lamp”, oxidised silver on copper, c1932; Private collection (photo: J. Thomson, Christchurch). Licensed CC BY-NC-ND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Being able to publish such a highly illustrated book depended on Ann’s ability to access and reuse GLAM collections around the country. She says: “Using CC, I was aware of the generosity of so many people, in particular professional and amateur photographers. Researchers always depend on those they interview and I was always thrilled to visit. Libraries and public art collections were exceptional – the Alexander Turnbull Library supplied a significant number of images. Staff everywhere were wonderful and interested in the use of CC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;“And in my thanks I must include the designer Gray Hodgkinson, who with Rosemary Tonk make up DesignSpace. With such an exciting design and card flyer, I knew that readers could access the story by image and later refer to the text for a closer reading. An eminent New Zealand librarian commented on the quality of the images and pronounced himself a convert to digital books – and hopefully to Creative Commons. CC gives access where access may previously have been denied.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, we are proud this year to be sponsoring the prizes for NZ school students for GIF IT UP 2015, which will be judged by GIF and comic artist &lt;a href="http://thewireless.co.nz/authors/toby-morris" target="_blank"&gt;Toby Morris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;GIF IT UP is a fun challenge coordinated by DigitalNZ and the Digital Public Library of America, which calls for the best GIFs created from copyright-free or openly licensed heritage material. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;GIF-makers can use any content they find via &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.digitalnz.org" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;digitalnz.org&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dp.la" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;dp.la&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and other international search services &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.europeana.eu" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;europeana.eu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trove.nla.gov.au" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;trove.nla.gov.au&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;. This material must be licensed for reuse. For example, it must be:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;in the public domain,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;have a ‘no known copyright restrictions’ statement,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;or have a Creative Commons licence that allows for reuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;GIF IT UP 2015 will be judged by an international panel of judges: Tim Hwang from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://imgur.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Imgur&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Rebecca Onion from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Slate Vault&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, and Alessandro Scali &amp;amp; Marco Calabrese from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://okkultmotionpictures.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Okkult Motion Pictures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;, who will be awarding a &lt;a href="http://www.giphoscope.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Giphoscope&lt;/a&gt; to one supreme GIF IT UP winner, as well as other prizes to three runners up. The GIF with the most Tumblr “notes” will also receive a people’s choice award. You can browse entries to GIF IT UP from around the world at &lt;a href="http://gifitup2015.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"&gt;gifitup2015.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;. If you'd like to create a GIF and enter it, &lt;a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/gif-it-up" target="_blank"&gt;here's where you'll find all the information you need&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a rather lovely GIF that Thomasin Sleigh at DigitalNZ made specially for me: a demure lady from &lt;a href="http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;amp;cl=search&amp;amp;d=EP19260626.2.151.1.1" target="_blank"&gt;Papers Past&lt;/a&gt;. Readers of the monthly Creative Commons Aotearoa newsletter, which I write, will know that I am a total sucker for old drawings of ladies with parasols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lady2.gif"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-803 size-full" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/lady2.gif" alt="Demure Papers Past lady GIF" width="348" height="831"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Evening Post, Volume CXI, Issue 151, 26 June 1926, Page 16. Papers Past, National Library of New Zealand. CC-BY-NC-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so fun. But making and publishing these 'shortest of all stories' both requires and is a product of important technical and cultural shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;Although based on existing artworks, GIFs are a new and original form of artistic expression. But, because they technically involve making copies of images, copyright law applies. This means that the artist is legally obliged to check the exact provenance, rights status and licence conditions of each image before using it -- and this is often almost impossible. Because of the unregistered nature of copyright, it can be incredibly difficult (and time-consuming) to track down the owner. And because of copyright’s long-lasting nature, even images that are several decades old, with long-dead creators, may still be in copyright.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;This is all assuming that you even know that the image you want to use exists. Currently, most of New Zealand’s publicly funded or publicly housed cultural heritage is unavailable for reuse by New Zealanders. Despite ongoing digitisation projects, these works are often neither commercially available nor publicly reusable. This means that creators who want to build on the works of the past are either forced to reinvent the wheel or go through a difficult process of asking permission, even when the original works are publicly funded and publicly housed and the creators are long deceased.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news, though, is that this is changing. There's a lot more detail in our upcoming book, &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Revolution: Growing Creative Commons in Aotearoa&lt;/em&gt;, but, in short, &lt;a href="http://openglam.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open GLAM&lt;/a&gt; in NZ is on the rise and growing fast. Galleries, libraries, archives and museums around the country are doing the hard yards of figuring out what the copyright situation is with the items in their collections; whether and how best to digitise them; and how to manage copyright in the unpredictable terrain of the internet. It can be difficult, frustrating and time-consuming work; but it's important, because what's at stake is New Zealanders' relationships with their own history and taonga. I believe that the ability to discover, learn from and creatively reuse our nation's artworks and other treasures is vital to our understanding of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the conversations I'm often having with people is about how &lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;something as seemingly dry as copyright licensing can have profound impacts on our society, culture and economy. If you're wondering how this might all work in practice in your workplace, we have heaps of &lt;a href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;free resources&lt;/a&gt; you can use, and I'm always up for a chat -- you can reach me on elizabeth@creativecommons.org.nz.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots to think about -- and lots to do! In the meantime, you have until 21 November to get your Open GLAM on, Kiwi-styles, and enter GIF IT UP. Let me know how you get on, especially if there are parasols involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hardly seems like a year since Open Access Week 2014 -- which means I must now have been at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand for just over a year! Running NZCommons during Open Access Week 2014 was one of my first jobs when I started. I started a learning curve then that is still going up and up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's the first day of Open Access Week 2015 so here's some great reading and viewing from around the world to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April is Open Education month here at NZCommons. Over at the Open Education Working Group, they have been putting together &lt;a title="Open Education around the world" href="http://education.okfn.org/world/" target="_blank"&gt;a series of blog posts&lt;/a&gt; about OER around the world. Here are a few snippets that caught our eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;India&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subhajit Ganguly is an Ambassador for &lt;a title="Open Knowledge Foundation India" href="http://in.okfn.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Knowledge Foundation India&lt;/a&gt;, a group of professors, scientists, researchers, hackers, programmers, government and civil society representatives. He says: “Improving education in India is one of our priority areas and we are exploring open education approaches. We have to work as much as we can in ensuring at least basic education for those children who are not likely to see the light of education due to various reasons. This is a monumental task, taking into account the gigantic size of the population of India. However, every little helps. … We aim to arrange for vocational, profession-based education for the adult population. This way, we can work towards uplifting the economy from the grassroots.” &lt;a title="Blog post on Open Education in India" href="http://education.okfn.org/open-education-india/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rwanda&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Bernard Nkuyubwatsi" href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/education/postgraduate-study/research-degrees/phd-research/phd/bernard-nkuyubwatsi" target="_blank"&gt;Bernard Nkuyubwatsi&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of the Rwandan Ministry of Education, says: “The Open Learning Exchange Rwanda has been making educational resources more accessible and One Laptop per Child has distributed more than 100,000 laptops and aims to hit 500,000 computers distributed in primary schools.  … The most compelling accomplishment in opening up education in Rwanda is probably a high primary school enrolment, which was 98.7 percent in 2010. However, the road is still steep for secondary education (35.8 percent) and more importantly, higher education (5.5 percent).” &lt;a title="Open Education in Rwanda" href="http://education.okfn.org/open-education-rwanda/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;South Africa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Anna Wertlen is founder and chairperson of the Village Scribe Association for the advancement of innovative ICTs in development. She says: “The Village Scribe Association (VSA) is a small NGO in the poorest province of South Africa, the Eastern Cape. The Trust partners with a small IT company called eKhaya ICT, and together they have developed an online learning network that is suitable for school computer labs with no or low-quality internet access. Awarenet is a P2P social network, which combines the functions of well known social networks such as facebook, YouTube, Flickr and Wikipedia additionally to personal messages, blogs, chat rooms and creative spaces such as a scribble tool.” &lt;a title="Blog post on Open Education in SA" href="http://education.okfn.org/open-education-south-africa/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stella HaYoung Shin is a Ph.D candidate of Educational Policy and Administration at Sookmyung Women’s University in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, South Korea. She says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Much of my work at Sookmyung Women’s University (SMWU) has been devoted to developing OER surroundings in South Korea through launching and running SNOW (Sookmyung Network for Open World) during 2009--2010. SNOW has launched a vision of an ‘OER missionary’ to Korean users under the motif to provide valuable global OER to Korean users and accessible guidelines to make use of them. Comparing other OER interfaces and service providing organizations and web-sites, SNOW can be one of the most ‘kind’ and ‘open’ OERs allowing users find localised OER easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“SNOW developed an interactive OER localising platform for not only students of SMWU but also general users seeking ‘kind, local’ OERs. The most remarkable achievements of SNOW are the user-based content uploading-sharing-review system, SNOW Wiki system, as cooperative translation and interactive revision system and SNOW Eco-system as unique credit-saving system for donation system. SNOW can be a frontier model to envision the way to distribute OER efficiently, legally based on Creative Commons licences, and suggests a mutual vitalisation of Asian universities’ OER projects.” &lt;a title="Blog post on Open Education in South Korea" href="http://education.okfn.org/open-education-south-korea/" target="_blank"&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the month of March (and a little bit of April), Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been travelling around Aotearoa spreading the word about Open Educational Resources for New Zealand schools. In case you didn't make it to any of these events, we've embedded the slides below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the month of March (and a little bit of April), Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been travelling around Aotearoa spreading the word about open access and open licensing for local Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM). In case you didn't make it to any of these events, we've embedded a video of one of the sessions plus the slides below, along with a short summary of what they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgNF5HZTBsU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Matt McGregor and Elizabeth Heritage, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Elizabeth began by introducing Creative Commons licensing in Aotearoa New Zealand. They then noted that, while new technologies had provided heritage organisations new opportunities to share their digital collections for reuse, copyright and licensing was still a significant barrier. Usage rights statements, they said, were often vague, overly restrictive and not standardised across the sector. They then ran through three specific recommendations, outlined in the slides, before giving a brief introduction to the licences themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702250" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Keitha Booth, New Zealand Open Government Information and Data Programme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keitha introduced the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework, which advocates for the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector. Keitha noted that the Open Government Data and Information Programme had expanded its focus to local government. She outlined the NZGOAL adoption process, and the policy framework for each institution, both of which are detailed in the slides below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702435" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Victoria Leachman, Rights Advisor, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Victoria outlined Te Papa's experiences with Creative Commons licensing, beginning with the Rita Angus podcasts in 2008. Victoria noted that CC licensing these podcasts had enabled them to be used by other institutions touring the exhibition -- without Te Papa having to write detailed usage agreements. After running through several other CC projects, Victoria discussed the download project, which has so far released over 48,000 images for free high-resolution download. Victoria noted that usage was much greater than predicted at the beginning of the project, and that it was being used for a range of purposes. Victoria closed her presentation by outlining the challenges to open access and open licensing for the GLAM sector, and highlighting the approach taken in response to these challenges thus far by Te Papa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702446" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager, DigitalNZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After introducing DigitalNZ and its mission, Thomasin showed the famous 'magic hat' diagram, which outlines how content from individuals and organisations around New Zealand is harvested by the DigitalNZ and made more easily searchable by the aforementioned magic hat (otherwise known as the DigitalNZ API). She then gave an overview of DigitalNZ's approach to rights, and pointed out some of the common issues faced by DigitalNZ as it attempts to provide clear rights information to end users. Thomasin argued that the point of working through these rights issues was to help produce "a world in which our shared cultural heritage is open to all, regardless of their background. A world in which people are no longer passive consumers of cultural content created by an elite, but contribute, participate, create and share." Thomasin concluded with several standout local and international open GLAM case studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/46702442" width="476" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader, Alexander Turnbull Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark began by noting that the internal debates around use and reuse within the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa repeated debates that are taking place in society at large. Many of the issues around reusing collection items were difficult, and many of them turned on the notion of trust. Mark then noted that rights statements across the sector were inconsistent, and that the National Library of New Zealand had developed a set of policy principles to address this inconsistency, which are outlined in the slides. Implementation, he said, was ongoing, though three issues currently being addressed were donor and depositor agreements, a flowchart to guide the release process, and improving the rights statements and licensing on indigenous knowledge works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000;"&gt;Allison Brown, Digital Services Coordinator, University of Otago Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allison discussed the use of Creative Commons licensing within the University of Otago library. In particular, she gave her experience in discussing CC licensing with rights holders, applying CC licensing in a library context, supporting the use of CC by others, managing the use of CC and promoting CC to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, we turned around twice and suddenly it’s the fourth week of the Creative Commons Road Trip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Matt McGregor and I were in the same room as each other for the first time in a couple of weeks, and we took the opportunity to swap notes. It’s been a crazy busy fortnight but so much fun. Huge thanks to our awesome team of speakers and facilitators who are doing such a brilliant job -- and thank you to everyone who has come along so far. We’re really enjoying meeting new people, fielding new questions (that always make us think!), and hearing new stories about how Kiwis are using -- or want to use -- Creative Commons in such a range of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 2 of the Road Trip saw us travelling around the country; Matt in the North Island and me in the South. Between us -- and with the help of our trusty facilitators -- we delivered events in Hamilton, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Whanganui. Then Week 3 was even busier: the Creative Commons Road Trip made back to Auckland, Hamilton, and Dunedin, plus branching out to Tauranga and Palmerston North. Events have been targeted at the schools and heritage sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been great to have requests come in from schools and heritage institutions around the country for events where they are. We’ve added Napier to the mix now! The CC Road Trip will be there on 1-2 April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-488" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CC BY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that weren’t enough, we’re really pleased to announce that we’re extending the Road Trip and branching out into Open Education. Come along to hear about the future of Open Educational Resources in Aotearoa, featuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Billy Meinke, formerly of Creative Commons International, who will talk about his experience with some of the world’s largest OER projects, including the US Government’s $2billion TAAACT grants for OERs at community colleges.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Simon Hart, Richard White and Erika Pearson from the Media Text Hack team at the University of Otago, who will talk about the development of an open, CC-licensed Media Studies textbook — over the course of a weekend.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Matt McGregor, Public Lead of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, who will talk about the future of OERs in the Kiwi tertiary sector, and talk about how educators and institutions can create, use and adopt open textbooks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be running events in mid-April in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch, completely free. &lt;a title="OER events" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2015/03/open-education-in-aotearoa/" target="_blank"&gt;Register here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards to Week 4! There are still places left for our Wellington and Christchurch heritage sector events, so &lt;a title="GLAM Road Trip" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;register today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-GLAM.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-489" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-GLAM-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CC BY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was originally published in the March edition of the &lt;a title="Education Gazette" href="http://www.edgazette.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Education Gazette Tukutuku Kōrero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times today have you broken the law? If you’re a teacher who likes to adapt and share resources, the answer might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently a major problem with copyright in education. Under the 1994 Copyright Act, employers (for schools, this means the Board of Trustees) hold the copyright to all teaching resources that teachers create in the course of their employment. This means that when teachers seek to save time and money by sharing these resources (including taking resources they have created from one job to another) but don't have the Board's express permission, they are infringing copyright and breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the bad news. The good news, however, is that help is at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright is not like other forms of intellectual property (like patents and trademarks): you don’t have to apply or register -- you don’t even have to use the little © symbol. Copyright occurs automatically upon the creation of a work, and it is entirely up to the owner to permit or deny the right to copy that work as they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All owners of copyright everywhere -- including Boards of Trustees -- have the power to give permission for (or ‘license’) others to reuse their copyright works in specific ways. However, most copyright owners are not sure exactly how to do this in a clear and legally robust manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Creative Commons comes in: we provide free, legally robust and ‘human-readable’ licences that anyone can use to clarify what they want others to do -- and not do -- with their works. These licences can make copyright work for schools and for teachers, by enabling the sharing, adaptation and reuse of teaching resources and other works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to happen, schools need to adopt a Creative Commons policy, which effectively changes -- and clarifies -- the school’s default relationship with copyright. Instead of making it illegal to share, these policies enable and encourage the sharing of resources using Creative Commons licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a technical standpoint, this sharing is becoming easier every day. The increasing availability of digital technologies and the rise of centralised resource sharing portals -- like the Network for Learning portal, &lt;a title="Pond" href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/pond/" target="_blank"&gt;Pond &lt;/a&gt;-- have made the process of sharing simple and quick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more New Zealand schools start using Pond, Creative Commons licences can ensure that every teacher is able to share and collaborate with colleagues in other schools around the country confidently and legally. Simply put, digital technologies and Pond make sharing resources easy; Creative Commons licences make sharing resources legal. And the potential time- and money-savings of national-level collaboration are huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adopting a Creative Commons policy at your school, you’ll not only be making your working life easier, you’ll be following a growing trend. Over the past couple of years, over a hundred New Zealand schools have adopted a Creative Commons policy. Such policies provide a clear statement of a school’s position on in-copyright resources produced by teachers employed at the school, and allow teachers to use Creative Commons licensing to share their work for reuse. These policies also ensure that, when teachers leave, both the teacher and the school retain access to all teaching resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools with Creative Commons policies are well in line with current Government thinking. Boards of Trustees are encouraged to consider using Creative Commons licences for their teaching resources, using the &lt;a title="NZGOAL" href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/" target="_blank"&gt;New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework&lt;/a&gt;, approved by Cabinet in 2010. The recent &lt;a title="Future Focused Learning Report" href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/EducationInitiatives/UFBInSchools/FutureFocusedLearning.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Future Focused Learning in Connected Communities report&lt;/a&gt;, put out by Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye’s 21st Century Learning Reference Group, supported this by encouraging schools to enable teachers to use Creative Commons licensing to share their resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such school is Taupaki School, a co-educational primary school located an hour north-west of Auckland. On 20 February 2013, Taupaki School’s Board of Trustees passed a Creative Commons policy, giving permission to Taupaki’s teachers to share and collaborate, legally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for the policy was initially introduced by the school’s principal, Stephen Lethbridge, and was then overseen by Board Chair Paula Hogg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen introduced the idea of the policy after noticing that “teachers were sharing more and more resources online and connecting with a great many schools who were visiting us. It would have been a nightmare to seek permission from the board, more likely the school principal, every time a teacher or student wanted to share information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons policy is also strongly aligned with Taupaki School’s existing vision. Paula says, “Our school’s vision strongly encourages collaboration, and we encourage sharing, so it was a bit of a shock to learn that we needed to have a policy for teachers to share legally.  The Creative Commons policy was very aligned with our thinking as a board. There was no dissonance in our discussion. The main issue was that everyone was surprised to discover that this isn’t normal practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Paula, the Creative Commons policy passed because it supported the fundamental mission of the school — improving student outcomes. “We knew from the documentation Stephen provided, and from other background reading, that professional development is actually one of the best ways to lift student outcomes. And a big part of professional development is sharing best practice, including resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Works licensed under Creative Commons can also be a great resource for students as well as teachers. Since 2010, &lt;a title="DigitalNZ" href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;DigitalNZ&lt;/a&gt; (at the National Library) has been running the &lt;a title="Mix and Mash" href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Mix &amp;amp; Mash&lt;/a&gt; competition, which encourages Kiwi students to tell new stories by adapting and remixing Public Domain and Creative Commons licensed content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the May 2013 showcase, the student award was won by Travis, Evan and Jared Manning (aged 11, 9 and 6). Using stop motion animation, poetry, story writing and drawing, their video tells ‘The Story of Rangitoto.’ Judges praised the story as “a dramatic and exciting retelling of the origins of a familiar piece of the Auckland landscape."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as learning about copyright and licensing -- essential skills for digital citizenship -- Mix &amp;amp; Mash also encourages students to actively and legally engage with their cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re keen to learn more, and to see about getting Creative Commons licensing going at your school, the good news is that we’ve already done a lot of the legwork for you. Schools looking to adopt Creative Commons licensing can visit &lt;a title="CC in Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools/" target="_blank"&gt;creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools&lt;/a&gt; for a range of helpful tools, including an off-the-shelf Creative Commons policy that you can adapt for your own purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have officially completed the first five events of the Creative Commons Road Trip! When we planned the events back in December last year, we were expecting a quiet start to the month, with some &lt;a title="CC Road Trip schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;schools events&lt;/a&gt; in Auckland and Wellington, gradually branching out to Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin in the second week. In the third and fourth week, we were planning to basically repeat that pattern, shifting focus to the &lt;a title="CC Road Trip GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;heritage sector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we promoted the month, though, we started to get requests from other parts of the country,  quickly turning a tour of the main centres into a truly national road trip. Now that the organisational dust has settled, we’ve decided to also visit Tauranga, Napier, Havelock North, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Nelson and Greymouth. We’re also making plans to visit Hutt City, Whangarei and Invercargill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-488" src="http://wcmckee.com/ccanz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CC BY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we had a busy first week! In addition to the Creative Commons schools events in Wellington and Auckland, we held events in Greymouth, Nelson and Havelock North. Attendance varied: we had a small turnout for an after-school event in Auckland, though the staffroom at Havelock North High School at 8am was full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights from week one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The Network for Learning officially joined the Creative Commons Road Trip, with Tim Kong, Pete Hall and Carolyn Stuart attending the school events.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We had some &lt;a title="Bay of Plenty Times" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&amp;amp;objectid=11412205" target="_blank"&gt;handy coverage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Bay of Plenty Times&lt;/i&gt;, advertising our events in Tauranga on 16 March.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Melissa Laing, one of the new CC regional facilitators, gave her first (of many, we hope!) introductions to CC licensing, alongside Pete Hall from N4L and Esther Casey from Cognition Education.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;As one of our speakers was ill, Matt skyped into an event at Nelson Provincial Museum -- from a half-full internet cafe in Napier. Both the Nelson museum community and the Napier internet-cafe community now have a working knowledge of CC licensing in the heritage sector.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We’re receiving a heap of requests to send out resources. Keep them coming!&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We’ve launched our &lt;a title="CC resources" href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;new resources page&lt;/a&gt;, full to the brim with brochures, videos, posters and case studies on CC licensing in tertiary education, research, heritage and schools.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In week two -- starting today! -- we’re going to be running schools events in Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton and Dunedin, as well as a heritage event in Whanganui. Week two happens to overlap with international &lt;a title="Open Education Week" href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Education Week&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re excited to join our friends and colleagues around the world in spreading the news on the benefits of open educational resources. There are still places available at all our upcoming events, so &lt;a title="CC Road Trip" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/12/announcing-our-march-events/" target="_blank"&gt;register today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I interviewed Editor-in-Chief Evangelia Papoutsaki and Editorial Assistant Louise Saunders of &lt;a title="ePress" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/" target="_blank"&gt;ePress&lt;/a&gt;, an Open Access scholarly publishing house at Unitec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did your Open Access philosophy develop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global political economy is one of the key barriers to human social progress. Information should be free like the air we breathe and not a market commodity with a profit attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ePress we believe that knowledge should be accessible to all. Academics are paid by taxpayers to research and produce knowledge, and the idea that students and the general public must pay for that knowledge does not sit well with us. It should be available to anyone who has the desire to read and use it. Citizens have the right to learn; access to information and knowledge should not be through their wallets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did ePress come to be set up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EPress is an online, quality-assured, in-house publisher for authors and researchers working at, or associated with, Unitec Institute of Technology. As well as there being research produced at Unitec that needed a publishing home, there were other outputs such as performances, mixed media, design and art installations that all had potential as non-traditional publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of ePress emerged out of a desire to harness the publishing potential of all these outputs by providing a platform from which they could be shared. Launched in late 2011, ePress started off with the more traditional conference proceedings and reports, and quickly grew to embrace eMedia and books. In 2014 ePress really hit its stride with the publication of two books (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Press, Politics and People in Papua New Guinea 1950-1975" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/press-politics-and-people-in-papua-new-guinea-1950-1975/" target="_blank"&gt;Press, Politics and People in Papua New Guinea 1950-1975&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Philip Cass and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Ngā Reanga Youth Development Māori Styles" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/nga-reanga-youth-development-maori-styles-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Ngā Reanga Youth Development Māori Styles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Josie Keelan), an edited collection (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Communication Issues in Aotearoa New Zealand" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/communication-issues-in-aotearoa-new-zealand-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Communication Issues in Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; edited by Giles Dodson and Evangelia Papoutsaki), two wonderful eMedia (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Rosebank: Cabbages, Horses and Science" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/rosebank-cabbages-horses-and-science/" target="_blank"&gt;Rosebank: Cabbages, Horses and Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Paul Woodruffe and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="The Moveable Feast Collective Teach Design" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/the-moveable-feast-collective-teach-design-2/" target="_blank"&gt;The Moveable Feast Collective Teach Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Susan Jowsey) as well publishing conference proceedings for the 31st Annual Society of Architectural Historians Australia and New Zealand (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Translation" href="http://www.unitec.ac.nz/epress/index.php/translation/" target="_blank"&gt;Translation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;edited by Christoph Schnoor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2015 ePress unveiled new layouts and cover art for our regular series; launched a new series titled &lt;i&gt;Perspectives in Biosecurity Research Series&lt;/i&gt; edited by Dan Blanchon and Mel Galbraith; and announced the production of a forthcoming collection titled &lt;i&gt;Conceptual Works in Sports Studies&lt;/i&gt; and edited by Lesley Ferkins and Mieke Sieuw. It’s going to be a big year at ePress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you noticed any changes over time in the academic perception of Open Access scholarly publishing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. The perception used to be very much one of scholarly snobbery. If you weren’t in the right journal, or published to certain standards, it was of no merit to academia. However, things are changing, and fast. The methods for producing knowledge are changing and so too should our method of dissemination. More and more scholars are accepting and embracing the idea that there are other ways to prepare, produce and disseminate information. EPress has a strong focus on eMedia publications and they are a great example of alternative ways to share that knowledge. With these methods have come new researchers, authors and producers who believe that Open Access is the way forward for them. This new way of thinking is producing some truly fun and unique publications that might not have found a home anywhere else. More traditional publishers would not have been able to control their distribution and make a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has been your experience of publishing with a Creative Commons licence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When authors submit to ePress we explain our processes and the Creative Commons licensing system. We automatically assign new publications with the Attribution-NonCommercial licence and give the authors time to investigate the other licences, should they wish to change. The response to the licensing, and the one we auto-select for them, has been well received by all of our authors. For those who are new to Creative Commons, they have really embraced the goals of Open Access publishing – though they are publishing with ePress so to an extent they are probably Open Access supporters already!&lt;/p&gt;
