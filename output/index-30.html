<p>At the December 2012 combined AIAS/ANZACA (Australasian Institute of Anatomical Sciences / Australian &amp; New Zealand Association of Clinical Anatomists) conference in Coogee I gave a talk about some fabric models I had made for teaching anatomy.

<p><em>Was it a surprise to you to learn that you couldn't license the copyright to your work without the University's permission?</em></p>
<p>No. I'd sort of known of the University <a title="Otago University IP policy" href="http://www.otago.ac.nz/administration/policies/otago003229.html" target="_blank">policy</a> regarding intellectual property for decades, without considering that it would ever apply to me.

<p><em>How did you talk about this with your colleagues?</em></p>
<p>We briefly discussed the possibility of selling the patterns but decided we would get more benefit, as a Department, by sharing them. Sharing meant using Creative Commons but it also meant getting formal permission from the University to give away the standard copyright (see Otago Intellectual Property Policy, section 4a).

<p><em>What made the Anatomy Department decide to share your patterns rather than sell them?</em></p>
<p>We recognised that it would require quite a bit of time, money and effort to set up the kind of system whereby you could make sales of such items possible -- more than could be returned by the process. I've run a fashion business in the past and know how difficult it is to make sales to cover all of the costs involved.

<p>Early days yet. I'm sure other people in our department will be inspired once they see that it can be done.</p>

<h5><strong>BY RUPERT GATTI</strong></h5>
<p><em>This month we are featuring a series of articles from authors around the world on the them of Open Access to Research. This article by Dr Rupert Gatti originally appeared in </em>The Guardian<em>.</em></p>
<p>While academia is in the midst of a general funding crisis, multinational publishing houses are making vast profits from disseminating publicly funded research. New Open Access publishing models provide cost-efficient methods for disseminating research findings, eradicate excess profits by publishers and massively widen the readership of scholarly works. The UK government recognises this but their current reform agenda is nowhere near bold enough.</p>
<p>Academics as a rule do not write their books to make money — in fact, most receive only token royalties for their work. They do it to satisfy research assessments, to get hired and promoted and, most of all, to inform readers, spark debate, and contribute to the intellectual richness of their discipline. Commercial publishers reap high profits while putting up several barriers to the dissemination of research results. They do this in several ways: firstly, by imposing restrictions on copyright; secondly, by deciding which areas of research reach publication — a decision often based on marketing considerations that penalise cutting-edge and niche subjects. And thirdly, by imposing high prices on readers and libraries in order to maintain high profits and an obsolete infrastructure. Moreover, publishers increasingly bundle their numerous services into single large dissemination packages (so-called ‘Big Deals’), thus extracting large profits from libraries and universities while further restricting access to research by readers outside the academic community. The average price for an academic book is now around £50, with total sales running at around only 200 or 300 per title globally, predominantly to libraries in the US.</p>
<p>We have reached a point where university libraries cannot afford to buy access to the research done by scholars in their own institutions, as journal costs are now too expensive even for the wealthiest universities.</p>
<p>The <a title="Finch Report" href="http://www.researchinfonet.org/publish/finch/" target="_blank">report by Dame Janet Finch</a> and subsequent <a title="RCUK open access policy" href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/openaccess/" target="_blank">new policies announced by the UK Research Councils (RCUK)</a> fully support Open Access publication for all UK publicly funded research. While these are important steps in the right direction, the Finch recommendations and RCUK policies fall well short of pushing through the wholesale reforms required to make Open Access publishing the prime outlet for research results. The Finch/RCUK approach sustains the existing publishing landscape in journal publishing: the provision of Open Access articles would be paid for by the author instead of by the reader. Whilst this will certainly force publishers and researchers to make their work available to readers for free, it will be down to the existing publishers to set the price authors are required to pay. This would allow commercial publishers to maintain their exorbitant profit margins at the expense of the taxpayer and academic research budgets — albeit through a different payment channel (i.e. author charges rather than reader charges). It will also introduce a new series of publishing distortions. Researchers working at institutions with large budgets to pay for the dissemination of their staff's work will have access to the top journals. Internal rationing of available publishing funds may favour some researchers over others.</p>
<p>And these distortions will be exacerbated even further when it comes to the publication of monographs, where publishing charges are likely to be even higher. In fact the Finch Report says very little of book publishing, concluding that “it is difficult to encompass monographs within the discussion about promoting wider access to publications”. Despite the progress with scientific journals, there are very few viable Open Access publishers in the Humanities and Social Sciences, especially when it comes to publishing entire books.</p>
<p>Yet there is a simple solution available. It is time for members of the scholarly community to stop waiting for government legislation, funders or publishers to wholeheartedly embrace Open Access, and to recognise that commercial publishers are not required in the process of assessing quality or disseminating research findings -- in fact, that they can take matters into their own hands. Digital publishing has changed the way books are produced and distributed. Scholars are accessing information increasingly (or, in the case of most undergraduates, exclusively) online. We no longer need expensive printing and distribution networks: the Internet provides an instant, global and cheap publishing platform.</p>

<p><em>CC BY Dr Rupert Gatti</em></p>
<p>I have been part of a group of academics in Cambridge and London who were frustrated by the commercial publishers’ inability to adopt an Open Access model. We set out to discover whether Open Access could be a sustainable model for publication, and founded <a title="Open Book Publishers" href="http://www.openbookpublishers.com/" target="_blank">Open Book Publishers</a> in 2008. In a small team, and on a shoe-string budget, we publish high-quality, peer-reviewed, Open Access monographs in the Humanities and Social Sciences. We do this not by charging authors, but through a ‘freemium’ model: we make all of our monographs freely readable online, but, to cover our modest costs, charge a reasonable price for printed editions and certain digital formats. The model is incredibly fast and cost effective, and allows us to retain the quality and academic rigour of a traditional university press.</p>
<p>Our model is now well-honed and successfully spreading knowledge around the world: our books are currently averaging around 500 views per month, which is more than most printed academic books see in an entire lifetime. They are accessed by people in over 180 countries (most academic books are only available in Western university libraries), with large numbers coming from the developing world.</p>
<p>Of course ours is not the only way ahead for OA publishing in the humanities and social sciences, but by providing a sustainable model we are hoping that other academics and institutions will take note and feel emboldened to launch similar initiatives.  There's no reason why there shouldn't be a creditable Open Access book publisher in every university around the world, but it is going to require a collective shift in the academic mind-set. And an important part of this will be for academic institutions (appointment boards and libraries) to recognise the changing world of publishing and the active role they can play in it. And for funders to recognise that sustaining a publishing model which is obsolete and costly stifles industrial innovation. Our once beloved university presses used to perform a necessary and noble service, but they are no longer serving our needs. The future of our work’s dissemination is in our own hands — precisely where it should be. The question is whether we are prepared to hold on to it.</p>
<p><em>Dr. Rupert Gatti is a co-founder and the third Director of Open Book Publishers. He is a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he is a Director of Studies in Economics. His published academic work includes microeconomic analysis of competition in online markets, game theory and search theory.

<p>Early days yet. I'm sure other people in our department will be inspired once they see that it can be done.</p>

<h5>BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE</h5>
<p>We’re going on a road trip -- please join us!</p>
<p>Recently, my <a title="CCANZ" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ</a> (CCANZ) colleague Matt McGregor <a title="On Recent Changes at CC Aotearoa" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/recent-changes-cc-aotearoa/" target="_blank">wrote an article</a> setting out our goals here at CCANZ, and the thinking behind them.</p>
<blockquote>In general, these <a title="CCANZ goals" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/roadmap-2014-2016/" target="_blank">goals</a> centre on CCANZ assisting a range of public-sector organisations with open policy adoption and implementation, with a particular focus on the heritage, research and schools sectors. Our workplan focuses on providing a heap of in-person workshops and resources, including targeted policy toolkits, brochures, posters and discussion pieces from the CC community. … While we still support licence adoption in the creative sector, and still support sensible copyright reform, open policy advocacy has become the clearest path for a small NGO like CCANZ to contribute to lasting social change.</blockquote>

<p>Now it’s time for us to hit the road and really help that change take off. Firstly, we’re developing a whole new set of resources to enable Kiwis to understand how copyright works in Aotearoa and how Creative Commons can help people solve copyright-related problems in the workplace. No law degree required! We have created special, sector-specific toolkits for use in NZ schools, universities, polytechs, museums, archives, libraries and other educational or heritage institutions. These are all freely available at <a title="CC resources" href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">resources.creativecommons.org.nz</a> and include policy templates, case studies, posters, educational videos, slides and articles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Off-the-shelf policy templates that have been tried and tested in Kiwi institutions -- just change the names!</li>

    <li>Fully up to date and compliant with NZ law</li>

    <li>Created in consultation with people whose day job is copyright licensing, and designed to help solve real-life, specific problems</li>

    <li>Detailed case studies showing how Kiwis around the country are using Creative Commons to help solve copyright problems</li>

    <li>Simple and easy to use -- no copyright expertise required!</li>

    <li>Written by a combination of experts with detailed working knowledge of copyright law, Creative Commons licensing, and how these issues specifically pertain to the educational and heritage sectors in Aotearoa.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Red_Logo.jpg"><img class="wp-image-450 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Red_Logo.jpg" alt="Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand" width="240" height="240"></a> Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand. Logo licensed CC BY.</p>
<p>Secondly, as well as making these resources freely downloadable to everyone who comes to our website, we are also taking them to schools and heritage institutions around the country -- in fact, we’re going on a road trip! We've made a <a title="CC Road Trip schools poster" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cc-by-school-a3.pdf" target="_blank">poster for schools</a> and a <a title="CC Road Trip GLAM poster" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cc-by-GLAM-a3.pdf" target="_blank">poster for GLAM</a> that we invite you to display and share.</p>
<p>We’ve gathered together a bunch of wonderful speakers from within the Creative Commons community who between them have decades of experience in negotiating the realities of copyright and licensing specifically in NZ schools and heritage institutions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrew Matangi, Consultant, Buddle Findlay, Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ Legal Team</li>

    <li>Victoria Leachman, Rights Advisor, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa</li>

    <li>Stephen Lethbridge, Principal, Taupaki School</li>

    <li>Matt McGregor, Public Lead, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (and me)</li>

    <li>Mark Osborne, Senior Consultant, Core Education</li>

    <li>Keitha Booth, Manager, NZ Open Government Data Programme</li>

    <li>Anton Angelo, Research Data Co-ordinator, University of Canterbury Te Whare Wānanga o Waitara</li>

    <li>Richard White, University Copyright Officer, University of Otago Te Whare Wānanga o Otāgo</li>

    <li>Amanda Curnow, Web Technologies Librarian, Massey University Library Te Putanga Ki Te Ao Mātauranga</li>

    <li>Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager, Digital NZ; Member, Open Knowledge Foundation, Open GLAM Working Group</li>

    <li>Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader, Alexander Turnbull Library</li>

    <li>Esther Casey, Facilitator, Cognition Education</li>

    <li>Stephen McConnachie, ELearning Coordinator, Middleton Grange School</li>

</ul>
<p>We’re running more than a dozen (and counting!) events all across the country in March 2015. Details and registration at <a title="CC Road Trip GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank">creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip</a> for the GLAM sector and <a title="CC Road Trip Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/" target="_blank">creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip</a> for schools.</p>
<p>We are really keen to reach as many people as possible, so if you want to host an event at your place, please let us know: <a href="mailto:matt@creativecommons.org.nz">matt@creativecommons.org.nz</a></p>

<h5><strong>BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE</strong></h5>
<p><em>This piece was published in the New Zealand School Executive Officers' Magazine in late 2014.</em></p>
<p>In March 2014, the Network for Learning launched its ambitious resource sharing portal, <a title="Pond" href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/pond" target="_blank">Pond</a>. At the time of writing, hundreds of teachers have joined Pond; soon, all Kiwi teachers will be able to use Pond to openly share their resources with every other teacher in the country.</p>
<p>While teachers have a thriving culture of resource sharing, not much of this sharing is open or visible, which means that it can be hard for teachers to find good resources when they need them.</p>
<p>This causes thousands of teachers to reinvent the wheel, producing resources that have already been produced by others working elsewhere in the education system. Pond has the potential to change that, and enable more open sharing, for the benefit of everyone.</p>
<p>Before teachers can share resources, though, they are going to have to confront copyright. Copyright allows copyright holders to restrict what other people can do with a work. It is automatic (no ‘c’ required); it lasts for the life of the author plus fifty years; and it is more restrictive than most people realise.</p>
<p>So, how does this apply to teacher resources? Under section 21 of the 1994 Copyright Act, employers own the copyright of works produced by employees in the course of their employment. This means that any original copyright work produced by a teacher working at a New Zealand school is, by default, owned by the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>This, in turn, means that any teacher who shares without asking permission from his or her Board of Trustees is legally infringing the Board’s copyright.</p>
<p>This can cause disputes, especially when a teacher moves to another school and wishes to take their resources with them. Copyright restrictions can also discourage teachers from sharing and collaborating, potentially to the detriment of student achievement.</p>
<p>To solve these problems, and ensure that teachers can increasingly share and collaborate, <a title="CCANZ" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</a> is advocating the adoption of Creative Commons policies. These policies give teachers advance permission to share their resources using Creative Commons licences.</p>
<p>Creative Commons provides free licences that copyright holders can use to share their work for reuse. These licences are simple, clear and legally robust, and are used by schools, governments, universities and other public organisations all over the world. You don’t need to pay or register to use them.</p>
<p>Between fifty and one hundred schools have already adopted CC policies, with many more working to do so. Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand provides a range of support materials, including an off-the-shelf policy developed by Albany Senior High School.

<p>Over the last few years, we at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand have been thinking about an obvious but difficult question: what does a successful Creative Commons affiliate look like? This question has two interrelated parts. First, how should we structure ourselves? Second, what are our priorities? What are our goals? What should we do?</p>
<p>It sometimes seems like every CC affiliate has taken a different answer to that first question, which is hardly a surprise, given the diversity of the global affiliate community. Some affiliates are part of larger NGOs or thinktanks; some are located in faculties of law; others are more or less independent entities. Some larger countries, like Canada and India, have multiple affiliates, which share a range of legal and advocacy projects.</p>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has always been part of a larger NGO, though over the last year we've been slowly moving towards greater independence. In July, we left our long term host, the Royal Society of New Zealand, who had provided everything from office space to accounting, governance and managerial support.</p>
<p>In moving to our new host, the wonderful Open Education Resources Foundation, our advisory board and staff took on more responsibility, in return for greater control over our budget and leaner decision making processes. Simply put, we chose this new structure because it enabled us to do much more with our limited resources.</p>
<p>This brings me to the second question: as part of this move to greater independence, we also started rethinking what we do, day-to-day. The first thing we did, in late 2013, was move away from the breakdown of projects we'd borrowed from CCHQ. We decided that the four headings – 'Culture', 'Science', 'Government', and 'Education' – were too vague and broad to adequately represent our work.</p>
<p>'Culture,' for example, encompasses GLAM, creative arts and indigenous knowledge, which are three distinct projects. The same was true of education, which encompassed both our schools OER project and our OER project in the tertiary education sector -- which actually have relatively little to do with each other. Finally, the former literature teacher in me bristled that 'Science' was being used as a shorthand for 'open access to scholarly publishing.' As a result, we ditched 'Science' for 'Open Access to Research', and created a new project area for 'Open Data.'</p>
<p>At the end of the process, we had created eight new project areas – replacing the original four – which you can see <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">on the front page of our website</a>. For each of these projects, we developed an introduction and brought together a growing range of resources. We also developed a series of overarching goals (which we shared in our roadmap), and we are currently developing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jglu6rp8aH7y35BEMyzbgKt5tA7psDqAbgOrS93kjOM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">a detailed workplan</a>, which will outline how these goals will be achieved</p>
<p>In general, these goals centre on CCANZ assisting a range of public-sector organisations with open policy adoption and implementation, with a particular focus on the heritage, research and schools sectors. Our workplan focuses on providing a heap of in-person workshops and resources, including targeted policy toolkits, brochures, posters and discussion pieces from the CC community – which we have started to publish on our new sister site, NZCommons.</p>
<p>With this focus on open policy, we seem to be moving in the same direction as many other CC affiliates and NGOs (as the establishment of the <a href="http://openpolicynetwork.org/" target="_blank">Open Policy Network</a> suggests). While we still support licence adoption in the creative sector, and still support sensible copyright reform, open policy advocacy has become the clearest path for a small NGO like CCANZ to contribute to lasting social change.</p>
<p>Our success will largely depend on the growing number of volunteers and champions in and around our public institutions willing to advocate for open licensing to their colleagues, managers, clients and boards. A key part of our job – and one of the reasons we provide workshops and produce resources – will be to support the work these champions are doing to grow the commons.</p>
