<h5>BY MATT MCGREGOR</h5>
<p><em>This article was originally published in the <a href="http://www.nzpf.ac.nz/list/%252F2014" target="_blank">September 2014 New Zealand Principals' Federation magazine</a>.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Max Riley is a maths teacher at Nayland College in Nelson whose website, Nayland Mathematics, provides a range of high-quality resources that are reused by teachers all over the country. As of July 2014, the website has received over 1.5 million hits -- a truly extraordinary number for a school’s department homepage.</p>
<p>It’s worth pausing to consider the amount of time and energy that Max’s website has saved maths teachers across New Zealand. The teachers using the resources on Nayland Mathematics -- unlike many of their colleagues in other subjects -- no longer need to reinvent the wheel; they can, instead, spend their time adapting and improving Max’s resources to meet the needs of their own specific classrooms. Even if Max’s website saved only a few hundred teachers a few hours a month, this adds up to thousands of teacher hours every year.</p>
<p>There is, of course, only one Max Riley. But there are many thousands of New Zealand teachers who have spent their careers developing a range of high-quality resources. And there are many more thousands of teachers who would benefit from being able to easily find, use and adapt these resources, without having to worry about legal or technical restrictions. With over 50,000 teachers in the compulsory education sector, the potential savings in time and energy are enormous.</p>
<p>Here’s the good news: there’s no longer any technical reason why every school in New Zealand can’t replicate the success of Nayland Mathematics. With the increasing availability of digital technologies and the rise of centralised resource sharing portals like the Network for Learning portal, Pond, it is now trivially easy to share resources for reuse by every other teacher in the country.</p>
<p>But here’s the rub: under New Zealand copyright law, employers have first ownership to copyright works produced in the course of a teacher’s employment. This means that teachers who share copyright resources outside of the school are legally infringing their school’s intellectual property. As more sharing takes place online, copyright will become harder and harder to ignore, and may is likely to cause teachers considerable uncertainty. No teacher, after all, wishes to break the law.</p>
<p>To head off this uncertainty, I believe that schools need to clearly state their position on intellectual property and resource sharing. At the moment, schools tend to only think about copyright when problems arise, such as when teachers change schools and take their resources with them (leaving the school with an empty cupboard) or when teachers wish to monetise their resources (by, for example, writing and selling textbooks).</p>
<p>If schools address the issue of copyright in advance -- rather than after the fact -- they can ensure that everyone knows their rights and responsibilities. This has the twin benefits of preventing potential disputes and encouraging greater resource sharing and collaboration, with all the attendant professional benefits this provides.</p>
<p>Here’s the solution: over the last two years, over fifty New Zealand schools have adopted a Creative Commons policy, enabling their teachers to legally share their resources for adaptation and reuse. These schools, including Taupaki School, Albany Senior High School and Hutt Valley High School, passed their policy to address some of the thorny legal and moral issues of sharing copyright works.</p>
<p>These schools are well placed under current Government policy. Boards of Trustees are encouraged to consider using Creative Commons licences for their teaching resources, using the New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework, approved by Cabinet in 2010. The recent Future Focused Learning in Connected Communities report, put out by Associate Education Minister Nikki Kaye's 21st Century Learning Reference Group, supported this by encouraging schools to enable teachers to use Creative Commons licensing to share their resources.</p>
<p>A Creative Commons policy provides a clear statement of a school’s position on copyright resources produced by teachers employed at the school. Simply put, the policy allows teachers to use Creative Commons licensing to share their work for reuse. The policy ensures that when teachers leave, both the teacher and the school retain access to all teaching resources. It also ensures that teachers will be free to make the most of the Network for Learning sharing portal, Pond.</p>
<p>But what is Creative Commons licensing? It is a free and easy way for copyright holders to give permission to others to share and reuse their work. Each licence comes in both human- and lawyer-readable versions, meaning that everyone will be understand exactly what permissions have been granted.</p>
<p>Creative Commons licensing has been used by organisations all over the world -- including the White House, the New Zealand Government and MIT -- to enable resources to be shared and reused, for the benefit of everyone. In New Zealand, the licences are supported by Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, which supports licences users and provides a range of free supplementary resources.</p>
<p>As more New Zealand schools start using Pond, Creative Commons licences will ensure that every teacher is able to share and collaborate, confidently and legally. Simply put, digital technologies and Pond make sharing resources easy; CC licences make sharing resources legal.</p>
<p>With CC licensing and great online sharing portals, New Zealand has the opportunity to ensure that all teachers, no matter the subject or year level, have access to the best resources produced by their colleagues in other schools around the country -- without having to worry about any technical or legal restrictions. As Max Riley puts it, “The more we share, the more resources there will be for all.”</p>
<p>Schools looking to adopt Creative Commons licensing can visit <a title="CC in Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools" target="_blank">creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools</a> for a range of resources, including a link to an off-the-shelf policy produced by Albany Senior High School. Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is also willing to provide free workshops to schools and principals’ organisations. These can be arranged at <a title="CC workshops" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/workshops" target="_blank">creativecommons.org.nz/workshops</a> or by emailing matt@creativecommons.org.nz.</p>

<h5>BY MATT MCGREGOR</h5>
<p><em>This is re-posted from <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog" target="_blank">the Creative Commons International blog</a>. Thanks for Asia Pacific Regional Coordinator Jessica Coates for the editorial assistance!</em></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>In the first of a series of blog posts focusing on our global activities, Matt McGregor tells us of exciting developments in CC in New Zealand Aotearoa.</em></p>
<p>2014 has been a busy year for the commons in Aotearoa. After a few years of relatively slow progress, many of New Zealand’s public institutions have started to adopt open policies. So many, in fact, that we’ve decided to launch an entire website, <a href="http://http://nzcommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZCommons.org.nz</a>, dedicated to discussing the opportunities and challenges of opening New Zealand’s culture and knowledge for access and reuse. With a particular focus on copyright, licensing and the public domain, the NZCommons site aims to help cross-pollinate and energise the various open groups in New Zealand, who are all doing excellent work, though too often in isolation from one another. The site will have news, case studies and a range of pieces from New Zealanders working to grow the commons, supporting and encouraging the many individuals and institutions working to adopt CC licensing across the country.</p>
<p>And what a lot there is to be discussed. I’ve already mentioned some of the developments being highlighted on NZCommons in my <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/43758">recent post</a> to this blog about Creative Commons policies being passed in New Zealand schools, now up to the rate of around one per week. But the increased adoption of CC licensing hasn’t been limited to schools.</p>
<p>This year, both the <a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz" target="_blank">University of Waikato</a> and the <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz" target="_blank">University of Canterbury</a> passed open access mandates requiring all research published within their respective institutions to be uploaded to the library’s repository, enabling research to be made openly available as soon as possible. In so doing, they joined <a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/" target="_blank">Lincoln University</a> in paving the way for open access policies at other New Zealand research institutions.</p>
<p>And then, in the middle of the year, we saw three big developments in the heritage sector. First, the <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz" target="_blank">National Library of New Zealand</a> passed their excellent <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/blog/posts/our-new-use-and-reuse-policy">use and reuse policy</a>, which provides a clear framework for opening up the library’s collections. Under the policy, out-of-copyright works will be clearly labelled as such, which has not generally been the case in the sector; also, in-copyright works that are owned by the library will be made available under a Creative Commons licence. Our <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/11/national-librarys-new-use-reuse-policy/" target="_blank">case study of this policy has been up on NZCommons for a few weeks now.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Te Papa</a>, the Museum of New Zealand followed this announcement by <a href="http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2014/06/03/free-downloadable-images-from-te-papas-collections/" target="_blank">releasing over 30,000 high resolution images</a> under either a no-known copyright or a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives licence</a> — a figure that has since approached 40,000. As it happens, we published a <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/te-papas-openly-licensed-images/" target="_blank">case study about Te Papa</a> recently, as well. Since that release, Te Papa have signalled that they will shortly remove the ‘ND’ restriction from their licences.</p>
<p>Then, the <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/" target="_blank">WW100</a> team, announced that as part of New Zealand’s commemorations of the Centenary of World War I, the <a href="https://natlib.govt.nz/collections/a-z/alexander-turnbull-library-collections" target="_blank">Turnbull Library</a> was openly releasing the H Series of photographs taken during by New Zealand’s official photographer, Henry Armytage Sanders. As Melanie Lovell-Smith points out in a <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/photographing-new-zealanders-at-war" target="_blank">detailed background piece</a>, these photographs are “the most comprehensive visual record of New Zealanders on the Western front from 1917 to 1918.” Other GLAM projects, such as the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/11/marsden-online-archive/" target="_blank">Marsden Online project</a>, are also starting to use CC licensing.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting things about these announcements is the best practice implementation by each of the institutions. Although all of them use their own method, all of the photos are clearly marked as being available to download and free of copyright restrictions, with a detailed and easily accessible description of what you can and can’t do with the image (see pictured). Te Papa even allows you to use copyright status as a search term. This level of transparency when it comes to copyright is essential to unlocking the value of our national collections.</p>
<p><a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Object/41504/download"><img src="http://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/collections.tepapa.govt_.nz_Object_41504_download.jpg" alt="Wellington" width="500" height="333" border="0"></a></p>
<p><small></small><small><a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Object/41504/download">Excerpt from Te Papa’s image download page</a> / Te Papa Tongarewa</small></p>
<p>Other open projects — such open government data, open textbooks in higher education and legal tools for indigenous knowledge — are also progressing quickly. Working with Susy Frankel and Aroha Mead from <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz" target="_blank">Victoria University of Wellington</a> and CC Panel Member Karaitiana Taiuru, the local Creative Commons team is working on developing an indigenous knowledge notice that will help Māori creators, iwi (tribe) and hapū (sub-tribe) to release their works more openly.</p>
<p>In the government data sector, <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz" target="_blank">Land Information New Zealand</a> have released truly massive — and massively interesting — open datasets, including detailed aerial photography of the entire country and <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/news/2014-03/3d-models-released-christchurch-city" target="_blank">3D models of Christchurch before September 2010</a>. These openly licensed models can be adapted and 3D printed by anyone, to help remember the heritage that was lost in the earthquakes.</p>
<p>Taken together, these projects will add an enormous amount of high quality copyright works to the commons, making it easier to access and reuse the works produced and held by New Zealand’s public institutions. These releases promise to save time and money for both the organisations involved and the public. They will also enable others to adapt and build on existing works, which means that fewer people will have to — excuse the cliche — reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Good news, then. But these projects are only the beginning: there are thousands of other schools, heritage and research institutions with millions of copyright works that could be made openly available to the public for sharing and reuse. This could fundamentally change how New Zealanders access and engage with their culture and knowledge.</p>
<p>For this to happen, these sectors are going to need some help. To help out, we’re developing toolkits — remixing some resources and platforms developed by HQ, and making a bunch of our own — that organisations can use to open their works for reuse. These toolkits will include an introductory paper, brochures, articles, sample policies and examples of best practice from New Zealand and around the world. We’re hoping to launch them at the National Digital Forum in Wellington in late November.</p>
<p>Beyond the toolkits, though, we’re going to need much more open discussion and analysis on copyright, licensing and reuse — especially in the heritage sector, where copyright issues can be very complicated, and where there isn’t nearly enough information and discussion available online. NZCommons is designed to prompt that discussion. With it we hope to build momentum and support for more open policy across the country, and help realise the potential of the commons in Aotearoa.</p>

<p>In March 2015, we're holding (at least) 18 events across the country, focusing on schools and GLAM (that's galleries, libraries, archives and museums).</p>
<p>These events will be a chance to discuss how Creative Commons is being used across New Zealand's school and GLAM sectors. Our schools and GLAM organisations make and look after an extraordinary amount of high-quality works, and we think that there are massive social, cultural and economic benefits to sharing this work more openly.</p>
<p>Currently, we have events planned Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Hawkes Bay, New Plymouth, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Wellington, Nelson, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Westport. But we're keen to do even more! If you want CC to come to your organisation or region, and can help us find a venue and an audience, we'll be sure to come.</p>
<p>If you're keen to attend any of these events, please fill out the form below! There are more details regarding times, dates, venues and speakers on <a title="Creative Commons Roadtrip – GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/">GLAM events here</a> and on <a title="Creative Commons Roadtrip – Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/">schools events here</a>.</p>
<p>A big thanks to our partners, Land Information New Zealand and InternetNZ, for enabling us to hold these events. Also, a big thanks to LIANZA and Te Papa for partnering with us on the GLAM events.</p>

<h5><strong>BY MATT MCGREGOR</strong></h5>

<p>On 24 November, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand invited representatives from across the New Zealand research sector to attend a meeting on the development of open access policies in research institutions.</p>
<p>The purpose of the meeting was to enable the sector to share knowledge and expertise, particularly following the passage of open access policies at Lincoln University and the Universities of Waikato and Canterbury. The ultimate aim of the meeting was to encourage the development of strong open access mandates, to ensure that a greater proportion of New Zealand’s publicly funded research is made openly available.</p>
<p>We had a great turnout from across the sector, with a healthy mix of librarians, administrators, advisors, advocates and researchers.</p>
<p>The meeting began with a short presentation by <a href="https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/f-kubke" target="_blank">Fabiana Kubke</a>, of the Department of Anatomy at the University of Auckland and Chair of the Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand Advisory Panel (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kubke/creative-commons-aotearoa-new-zealand-policy-workshop-november-2014" target="_blank">her presentation slides are here</a>).</p>
<p>After noting several outstanding issues with the current research system -- including the reliance of academics on dubious metrics to determine research quality, as well as the amount of money spent by research institutions on copyright licensing and subscriptions -- Fabiana pointed out that New Zealand is lagging behind its international counterparts in the adoption of open access policies and mandates.</p>
<p>At this point, the group discussed the importance of <a href="http://www.tec.govt.nz/Funding/Fund-finder/Performance-Based-Research-Fund-PBRF-/" target="_blank">the Performance Based Research Funded</a> in determining publication practices. One participant noted that the PBRF relied on expert peer review, and did not itself specify which metrics these experts should use to determine quality; Fabiana, for her part, suggested that the PBRF could nevertheless actively encourage open access. (<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/10/review-of-the-performance-based-research-fund/" target="_blank">See Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ’s submission</a> to the 2013 review of the PBRF).</p>
<p>Fabiana also noted that the public discussion on open access has tended to focus on the ‘green/gold’ distinction. This distinction focuses on the means by which work becomes open -- i.e. whether it is made open via a repository (green) or publisher (gold) -- and overlooks the more important question of deciding how truly ‘open’ open access works should be.</p>
<p>The default for publicly funded academics, she argued, should be to make their works available as openly as possible, including the right to openly share and reuse. This will require academics to stop signing away their copyright to academic publishers.</p>
<p>Following this presentation, I gave a quick talk about the need for open licensing. I noted that if you don't make your work openly available from the beginning, it's likely to remain under ‘All Rights Reserved’ copyright for your entire life plus fifty years.</p>
<p>Open licensing, I argued, also: allows for greater educational reuse; enables work to be published in multiple venues, for multiple audiences; enables free translation; and lets people adapt and reuse your work in new and interesting ways. One participant asked if one could published in closed journals using CC licensing. I noted that some closed journals are becoming ‘hybrid’ by offering open access and CC licensing, sometimes for an article processing charge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~daven/" target="_blank">David Nichols from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Waikato</a> then discussed the passage of Waikato’s open access mandate (explained in some detail <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/open-access-university-waikato/" target="_blank">in this case study</a>). The development of the policy began with a public event, featuring several speakers (including Fabiana); after this event, David produced a detailed policy paper, outlining a range of different options for an institutional OA policy.</p>
<p>With University Librarian Ross Hallett, David brought this paper to various committees across the university, addressing and incorporating criticisms and concerns, with the university eventually settling on a policy of mediated deposit. This mediation enables the library to clarify rights on any particularly paper before deciding on what level of access to allow.</p>
<p><a href="http://cpas.anu.edu.au/about-us/people/danny-kingsley" target="_blank">Danny Kingsley</a>, formerly of the Australian Open Access Support Group and soon to be Head of Scholarly Communication at Cambridge University, then spoke about the development and implementation of -- and compliance with -- international open access policies. She began by pointing out that the best path forward is to mandate that the paper must be deposited into the institutional repository at the time of acceptance.</p>
<p>In her wide-ranging talk, she also noted that one cannot assume that academics have any great understanding of the scholarly publication process. She recommended working with liaison librarians, to speak to researchers on their own terms; she also recommended using incentives -- such as analytics on use -- to encourage deposits.</p>
<p>Danny mentioned the recent adoption of <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/rsrch/rinfrastruct/oa/policy/" target="_blank">open policy by HEFCE</a> and noted that compliance rates with existing OA policies in the UK are high (<a href="http://sparceurope.org/countingukcosts/" target="_blank">as outlined in this recent study, <em>Counting the Costs</em></a>).</p>
<p>One participant asked Danny about book publishing. Danny noted that books need different models for open access than journal articles, and that Knowledge Unlatched and other OA publishers are experimenting with these new models.</p>
<p>Emerson Vandy from the National Library of New Zealand followed Danny by introducing New Zealand’s existing repository technology. He explained that <a href="http://nzresearch.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZResearch.org.nz</a> harvests from all of the university institutional repositories, and exists to make all research outputs as discoverable as possible. NZResearch also works for those researchers whose institution doesn't have access to a repository. After discussing user analytics, Emerson noted that the Library would appreciate direction from universities as to what to do with NZResearch in the future.</p>
<p>Next up was <a href="https://nz.linkedin.com/pub/alison-stringer/25/a96/790" target="_blank">Alison Stringer, from the Ministry for the Environment</a>, who spoke about open data. She noted that public expectations around data are changing, and that users have much more focus on openness and collaboration, with reduced tolerance for embargo periods. She also noted that open data commitments can help researchers build a Return on Investment case for their research projects. She noted, though, that for data to be useful, researchers needed to adopt strong data management plans.</p>
<p>Alison pointed out that the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/how-we-work/general-information/open-access-policy" target="_blank">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has adopted a strong open access policy</a>; she also noted that the National Science Challenges do not mandate openness.</p>
<p>One participant asked about Crown Research Institutes, and Alison noted that they have dual functions -- for the public good, and for a commercial return -- which can sometimes be in conflict. IP policies at CRIs are often geared towards the latter. With multiple funders of research projects, it can also be difficult to establish which datasets are publicly funded and which are privately funded.</p>
<p>At the end of the session, participants discussed progress made at their respective institutions. The session concluded with a general agreement on the benefits of sharing experiences and information as OA policies and mandates are adopted across the rest of the research sector. There was a general agreement to hold more focused sessions again in 2015.</p>

<h5><strong>BY ELSBETH HYMES HANCOCK</strong></h5>
<p>The phenomenon of Fan Fiction has always been around in some way or other. The biggest argument in support of this is the biblical catchphrase 'there is nothing new under the sun', implying that we may as well just re-work what is around us and what we love, whatever the legal ramifications may be. Arguably any re-working of ancient myth -- which has been so prominent in the last few years, with Hollywood films such as <em>Hercules</em>, <em>Troy</em>, etc. -- could count as Fan Fiction now, just as it did for the ancient Greek playwrights. It's a matter of definitions and perspective, but the point is that we have always wanted to imagine and daydream about our favourite heroes and heroines.</p>
<p>For those still confused, Fan Fiction refers to stories written by individuals based on the world and rules of other works, including their favourite characters. Hence a portrayal of Hercules as a geeky teen who ends up with his first wife (in the Disney film) is against 'canon' (where he actually murders her in a rage), but there is no problem with that because myth is always being adapted and we have few reservations about publishing and copyrighting multiple conflicting versions of these myths, fairy tales and older fiction. This has always been the case. But the situation changes when you are building on copyrighted story lines written by authors sensitive about their characters and intellectual property.</p>
<p>Modern Fan Fiction started with science fiction fans in and around the mid-1970s, particularly to do with <em>Star Trek</em>, and has remained popular in this realm for a long time. Now, a Google search for Twilight -- or whatever your particular obsession might be -- will provide you with endless alternative story lines for your favourite heroes, showing that more and more Fan Fiction is being written and published. The most prominent sites for such activities include <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net" target="_blank">fanfiction.net</a>, <a href="http://www.wattpad.com/stories/fanfiction" target="_blank">Wattpad</a>, and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/" target="_blank">Archive of Our Own</a>. As the names suggest, these stories are written by fans and, just like playwrights of old, they manipulate characters, romances, and story lines, changing them creatively to fit their new imagined stories. Where else could you read a Firefly/Buffy crossover, or your favourite characters finally getting together?</p>
<p>Beyond entertainment and community, teachers have even seen how Fan Fiction can motivate students. They have set assignments, encouraging students to write Fan Fiction as a way to learn to write and enhance creativity: <a href="http://writingcommons.org/open-text/new-media/fan-fiction/653-fan-fiction-in-the-composition-classroom" target="_blank">read more about it here</a>. Indeed, Hugh Howey, the author of the best-selling <em>Silo Trilogy</em>, wrote that writing Fan Fiction is “<a href="http://www.hughhowey.com/where-words-become-worlds/" target="_blank">writing with training wheels</a>” -- and what better way to fall in love with writing than in a safe environment?</p>
<p>But what are the legal ramifications? It depends on the individual author. There are a few dangers for authors reading Fan Fiction, as they may be accused of plagiarism or copyright violation due to similarities between their works and works fans have already published. It is common to have an established “I never read any Fan Fiction based on my stories” for just such legal protection. <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/writers-fanfiction/" target="_blank">Read more about that here.</a></p>
<p>Ultimately, as long as there is no monetary gain, there is nothing that can be done to stop Fan Fiction. In fact, this engagement with an author’s world can actually be beneficial to a series or brand, since it helps to keep fans interested, and can even grow their fan base. Entering into a community of others who shared in your fandom can be rewarding, and most Fan Fiction starts with some sort of disclaimer asking either not to be sued or just a simple statement that they are aware that they the characters originated with someone else.</p>
<p>Corporations have only just now arrived on the scene. In May of 2013, Amazon launched <a href="https://kindleworlds.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Kindle Worlds</a>, which is essentially a selective, monitored and monetised version of the above websites. While contributions are significantly lower, it is a place where Fan Fiction writers can, at long last, can acquire their own copyright and profit.</p>
<p>The release of the book <em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/from-fifty-shades-to-after-why-publishers-want-fan-fiction-to-go-mainstream/2014/10/24/825d6a94-5a04-11e4-b812-38518ae74c67_story.html" target="_blank">After</a></em>, a piece of fiction based on the group One Direction, has thrown Fan Fiction into the mainstream once more, since <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> was adapted from Twilight Fan Fiction (<em>Masters of the Universe</em>). So what has changed? People are still publishing Fan Fiction online by the thousands, but more and more of it is leaking into traditional publishing, with writers either shaking off their Fan Fiction origins or publishers finding raw talent and having them write something more easily copyrightable. It is becoming easier for authors to move from publishing at a Fan Fiction dedicated site to self-publishing, with some authors being scouted online without having to send manuscripts out.</p>
<p>Now, finally, we can ask what this means for Creative Commons. In order to be copyrightable, a work must be original and expressed in a tangible form. Does Fan Fiction count as original? It is certainly creative -- but <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> had to be adapted out of its original <em>Twilight</em> context, and <em>After</em> had to change the names of the band members. But originality does not necessarily mean completely new, and therefore can be similar to other works so long as there is no copying. Indeed, in the United States, fair use has been considered to apply to works of Fan Fiction in a non-profit (or educational) scenario.</p>
<p>Rather than rigorously guard one's characters and stories, part of the point of writing is to be read -- that is, getting your ideas out there. It is said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and this holds true for Fan Fiction. Hugh Howey encourages Fan Fiction within all his worlds, posting them to his own website, and he has also engaged in Kurt Vonnegut's world via Amazon’s Kindle Worlds.</p>
<p>The answer is always to be more open, to allow for maximum creativity. A Creative Commons licen<em>c</em>e on an original work shows that an author is open to Fan Fiction: open to his or her fans adapting, building on and sharing the work. The financial side will always be the more difficult. For now, however, people should be encouraged to explore writing, being as creative as possible by using, adapting and recreating fiction which can then be shared and exchanged easily.</p>

<em>Berlin-based Kiwi illustrator <a title="Judith Carnaby" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/" target="_blank">Judith Carnaby</a> shares her experience with Creative Commons.</em>
<p>I first became aware of Creative Commons through reading about <a title="Lawrence Lessig" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig" target="_blank">Lawrence Lessig</a> and his work. The more I read about the development of Creative Commons and the <a title="Copyleft" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft" target="_blank">copyleft </a>movement, the more interested I became in the CC licences as a less restrictive and more inclusive way to license my work.<strong><strong></strong></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JC_CC_CALENDAR_3.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-425" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JC_CC_CALENDAR_3-212x300.png" alt="Swimsuit calendar by Judith Carnaby" width="212" height="300"></a> Swimsuit calendar (July) - Lawrence Lessig. Judith Carnaby, CC BY-SA</p>
<p>My first illustrations published under a CC licence were for Sam Muirhead's 2013 Year of Open Source <a title="Year of Open Source swimsuit calendar" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/YEAR-OF-OPEN-SOURCE" target="_blank">swimsuit calendar</a>, created as a part of his crowdfunding campaign. My illustrations for the calendar (see example above) were of the heroes and heroines of Free Software, Open Hardware and Free Culture, depicting some of the people who have done most to exemplify or further the cause of a more open, collaborative or more freedom-conscious approach to working, thinking and licensing.</p>
<p>It was sent as a thank-you to Sam's crowdfunding donors, and due to his focus on Open Source, he also wished to release the images online, with an Attribution-ShareAlike licence, so that people could download, remix and distribute the images. Working with Sam and learning about the people I was illustrating made me think a lot more about the licensing I used for my own work, and since then I have licensed my personal (non-commercial) work under an Attribution ShareAlike licence.</p>
<p>I chose that particular licence because I like that the Attribution ShareAlike licence gives others the freedom to be able to use my work in any way they wish to, but only if they then allow others to use that work in the same way. By including the sharealike restriction in the licence, if someone wishes to use my work commercially then they must also open up their own work, which I feel is a positive thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JC_CC_SELF_PORTRAIT.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-426" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JC_CC_SELF_PORTRAIT-300x300.png" alt="Judith Carnaby, Self Portrait" width="300" height="300"></a> Judith Carnaby, Self Portrait. Licensed CC BY-SA</p>
<p>One of the most interesting recent developments for illustration has been the large-scale and high-resolution releases of public domain images from the collections of <a title="Rijksmuseum" href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/explore-the-collection" target="_blank">institutions in the Netherlands</a>, the <a title="British Library" href="http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/welcome.htm" target="_blank">UK </a>and <a title="New York Public Library" href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/" target="_blank">New York City</a>. Having a huge wealth of unrestricted imagery that can be used and remixed opens up new ways of working, as well as deepening understanding the history and development of illustration as a discipline. More broadly, these online collections of illustrations give us greater and important access to the world's cultural history.</p>
<p>In my personal work I can choose to license my work as I wish to, but my commercial work is often restricted due to the different needs of my clients. Copyright of commissioned illustrations usually belongs to me, the author of the work, unless there is an agreement for specific use of the illustration. That can depend on what clients are wanting to use the work for, and what length of time. For example, they may wish to use the image online for two months, or two years, after which I can resell or republish it as I wish. Contracts can include agreements that I, or the client, cannot use the illustration for any other purpose other than what was agreed upon. Using copyright agreements often protects an illustrator from being taken advantage of, but most businesses have a limited view on what copyright means and can unnecessarily restrict an illustrator’s right (or sometimes need) to reuse, remix or resell an image.</p>
<p>I like to work with clients who are aware of CC licences and use them in their own businesses. For example, I created the cover design for Thomasin Sleigh's novel <a title="Ad Lib" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/AD-LIB" target="_blank"><em>Ad Lib</em></a>, which was <a title="Ad Lib case study" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/ad-lib-novel-published-cc/" target="_blank">published under a CC licence</a>. Another example is the info-video for a bicycle sharing platform, <a title="BikeSurf Berlin" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/filter/moving%20image/BIKESURF-ORG" target="_blank">BikeSurf Berlin</a> (see below). To me it makes complete sense to license my work in this way. However, I am disappointed that no one seems to have used or remixed my personal work at all!</p>

<p>My first illustrations published under a CC licence were for Sam Muirhead's 2013 Year of Open Source <a title="Year of Open Source swimsuit calendar" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/YEAR-OF-OPEN-SOURCE" target="_blank">swimsuit calendar</a>, created as a part of his crowdfunding campaign. My illustrations for the calendar (see example above) were of the heroes and heroines of Free Software, Open Hardware and Free Culture, depicting some of the people who have done most to exemplify or further the cause of a more open, collaborative or more freedom-conscious approach to working, thinking and licensing.</p>
<p>It was sent as a thank-you to Sam's crowdfunding donors, and due to his focus on Open Source, he also wished to release the images online, with an Attribution-ShareAlike licence, so that people could download, remix and distribute the images. Working with Sam and learning about the people I was illustrating made me think a lot more about the licensing I used for my own work, and since then I have licensed my personal (non-commercial) work under an Attribution ShareAlike licence.</p>
<p>I chose that particular licence because I like that the Attribution ShareAlike licence gives others the freedom to be able to use my work in any way they wish to, but only if they then allow others to use that work in the same way. By including the sharealike restriction in the licence, if someone wishes to use my work commercially then they must also open up their own work, which I feel is a positive thing.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting recent developments for illustration has been the large-scale and high-resolution releases of public domain images from the collections of <a title="Rijksmuseum" href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/explore-the-collection" target="_blank">institutions in the Netherlands</a>, the <a title="British Library" href="http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/welcome.htm" target="_blank">UK </a>and <a title="New York Public Library" href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/" target="_blank">New York City</a>. Having a huge wealth of unrestricted imagery that can be used and remixed opens up new ways of working, as well as deepening understanding the history and development of illustration as a discipline. More broadly, these online collections of illustrations give us greater and important access to the world's cultural history.</p>
<p>In my personal work I can choose to license my work as I wish to, but my commercial work is often restricted due to the different needs of my clients. Copyright of commissioned illustrations usually belongs to me, the author of the work, unless there is an agreement for specific use of the illustration. That can depend on what clients are wanting to use the work for, and what length of time. For example, they may wish to use the image online for two months, or two years, after which I can resell or republish it as I wish. Contracts can include agreements that I, or the client, cannot use the illustration for any other purpose other than what was agreed upon. Using copyright agreements often protects an illustrator from being taken advantage of, but most businesses have a limited view on what copyright means and can unnecessarily restrict an illustrator’s right (or sometimes need) to reuse, remix or resell an image.</p>
<p>I like to work with clients who are aware of CC licences and use them in their own businesses. For example, I created the cover design for Thomasin Sleigh's novel <a title="Ad Lib" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/AD-LIB" target="_blank"><em>Ad Lib</em></a>, which was <a title="Ad Lib case study" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/ad-lib-novel-published-cc/">published under a CC licence</a>. Another example is the info-video for a bicycle sharing platform, <a title="BikeSurf Berlin" href="http://judithcarnaby.com/filter/moving%20image/BIKESURF-ORG" target="_blank">BikeSurf Berlin</a> (see below). To me it makes complete sense to license my work in this way. However, I am disappointed that no one seems to have used or remixed my personal work at all!</p>
