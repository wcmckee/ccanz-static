<p>The Waikato Independent is edited by <a href="http://www.wintec.ac.nz/mediaarts/about/staff/charles-riddle.aspx">Charles Riddle, Lecturer in the School of Media Arts</a>. As Charles explains, “We use the Waikato Independent as a teaching tool. What we’re really interested in is getting our students’ work published as widely as possible.</p>
<p>“We put their work up under an open Creative Commons licence so that any of the community newspapers or websites that like the work can feel free to republish it, as long as they acknowledge the student as the author.</p>
<p>“The idea was that other media would pick it up, because the more widely a student can get published, the better it looks on their CV.”</p>

<p>Other media are paying attention. In February, <a href="http://www.waikatoindependent.co.nz/2013/02/wintec-music-student-through-to-final-x-factor-audition/10909/">this story</a> about a local talent show contestant, written by Caitlin Wallace, was picked up by <a href="http://www.hamiltonnewslive.co.nz/news/wintec-student-amy-Maynard-Hassett-x-factor/1773541/">Hamilton News Live</a>; that story, in turn, was picked up by the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10868303.">New Zealand Herald</a>, New Zealand’s largest newspaper. “It can have that knock-on effect that we’re not even always aware off.”</p>
<p>Another recent example of reuse is <a href="http://www.waikatoindependent.co.nz/2013/02/cody-cooper-wins-motocross-second-round/10889/">this story</a> about a local Motocross rider, written by Corey Rosser, which was republished in <a href="http://www.sunlive.co.nz/news/39637-papamoa-man-wins-motox-round-2.html">Sun Live</a>.</p>
<p>Faculty at Wintec’s <a href="http://www.wintec.ac.nz/mediaarts/index.aspx">School of Media Arts</a> have introduced Creative Commons licensing as part of their wider focus on media law and copyright, specifically in their third-year Web Media course.</p>
<p>Most students, Charles says, are happy to give their work an open licence. Occasionally, a photographer will want to maintain ‘All Rights Reserved’ copyright; otherwise, as Charles puts it, “we keep everything open.”</p>
<p>But what about when students graduate? Charles notes that his students may not always have a choice to use open licensing, especially if they work for more conventional news organisations. “But if they’re going to end up in Public Relations, using Creative Commons makes a lot of sense, really. We have quite a few that go into that. I would expect that they would write under Creative Commons.”</p>
<p>While noting that Creative Commons licensing is still a new concept for many, Charles points out that the licences have been a success for Wintec’s journalism students.</p>
<p>“It works fantastically for us.”</p>

<em>Read <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/creative-commons-for-new-zealand-schools/">this piece, published last year in the Education Gazette</a>, for a brief introduction to the concept of Creative Commons policies for schools.</em>
<h5>What is a Creative Commons Policy?</h5>

<p>A Creative Commons policy enables all teachers within a school to share their teaching resources under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. This means that they can legally share and collaborate with other New Zealand teachers, without having to ask permission from their Board of Trustees.</p>
<h5>What is Creative Commons?</h5>

<p>Creative Commons provides free, simple to use and legally robust licences, to enable people to easily share and reuse copyright material. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank">The six main Creative Commons licences</a> give a range of permissions, from more free to more restrictive. The more restrictive licences prevent derivative works and commercial reuse; the most open licence allows users to adapt, remix and share materials as they wish, as long as they credit the original work. <a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782">Our video</a> provides a quick and easy explanation of the licences.</p>
<h5>Why can't teachers decide to use Creative Commons for themselves?</h5>

<p>The copyright to all resources made by teachers in the course of their employment is held by their employer--i.e., their Board of Trustees. In order to avoid infringing copyright, teachers technically have to ask their BoTs for permission before they share resources.</p>
<h5>Why do teachers need to share?</h5>

<p>While all classrooms are different, many teachers around the country are facing similar challenges. Creative Commons licences allow teachers to reuse resources from other New Zealand teachers and adapt them to their specific classroom situation.</p>
<p>Because <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank">the six main Creative Commons licences</a> all require users to provide attribution, teachers will receive credit when their high-quality resources are used by others.</p>
<h5>What will the policy achieve?</h5>

<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cc.large_.png"><img class="wp-image-2249 alignright" title="cc.large" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/cc.large_-300x300.png" alt="" width="180" height="180"></a>Beyond enabling teachers to legally share resources and collaborate, Creative Commons policies have been found to contribute to wider cultural change within schools. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/" target="_blank">Albany Senior High School, for instance, found that</a> "teachers are collaborating more, and they’re also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources."</p>
<p>The policy will also introduce the issue of copyright and open licensing to both teachers and students.</p>
<h5>Why now?</h5>

<p>With the rise of Ultra Fast Broadband and hand-held devices, it has become extremely easy to copy and reuse material found online. However, this also means that it is become easy for everyone--including students and teachers--to unintentionally violate copyright. It is more important than ever for both students and teachers to know about copyright, as well as free and legal alternatives like Creative Commons.</p>
<h5>What is the New Zealand Government's position on Creative Commons licensing?</h5>

<p>The <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal" target="_blank">New Zealand Government Open Access Licensing framework (NZGOAL)</a> was approved by Cabinet on 5 July 2010, to guide public agencies in their release of materials for creative reuse. Where appropriate, NZGOAL recommends that public agencies apply <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Creative Commons-Attribution licences</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://nzgoal.info/quick-guides/quick-guide-for-agencies/" target="_blank">Under the current framework</a>, NZGOAL “invites school boards of trustees... to take NZGOAL into account when releasing copyright material and non-copyright material to the public for re-use.” By adopting a Creative Commons policy, schools will find themselves in line with government policy, and will be well placed for any further developments in this area.</p>
<h5>
<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3530 alignleft" title="Remix Kiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="218"></a>What about when teachers leave?</h5>

<p>A Creative Commons policy will ensure that when  teachers move to a new school, both the teacher and the school can retain access to all teaching resources.</p>
<h5>Will the policy mean that the school gives up its copyright?</h5>

<p>Not at all. The Creative Commons licences simply mean that the school gives permission for others to share and reuse its copyright works. There are six Creative Commons licences, ranging from more free to more restrictive. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank">Learn more about the licences here</a>; or, alternatively, watch <a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782" target="_blank">this short video</a>.</p>
<h5>Who has a Creative Commons policy?</h5>

<p>Creative Commons policies have been adopted at <a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/">Albany Senior High School</a>, <a title="Warrington School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/warrington-school/">Warrington School</a>, <a title="Wellington High School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/12/wellington-high-school/">Wellington High School</a> and Tawa Intermediate. Follow those links for detailed case studies on their use of Creative Commons. Many other schools are in the process of adopting a Creative Commons policy.</p>
<h5>How much does it cost?</h5>

<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand provides its licences free of charge.</p>
<h5>Will I have to write my policy from scratch?</h5>

<p>No. Albany Senior High School has kindly <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank">made its policy available under a Creative Commons Attribution licence</a>. This means that all schools are free to adapt and reuse the policy for themselves.</p>
<h5>What do I do next?</h5>

<p>1) Learn more about Creative Commons licensing. Talk with teachers and about copyright and Creative Commons.</p>
<p>2) Draft your policy.</p>
<p>3) Take your policy to your Board of Trustees for approval.</p>
<p>4) Begin sharing your educational resources.</p>
<h5>What if I want to teach Creative Commons licensing to my students?</h5>

<p>Alongside education on copyright, plagiarism and privacy, Creative Commons has become an integral part of good digital citizenship. To support efforts by teachers to introduce Creative Commons licensing to students, we've developed a range of resources. <a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782">Our video </a>is the best introduction to the licences themselves. This short <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Free-to-Mix.pdf">Free to Mix guide (PDF)</a> is a simple introduction copyright, Creative Commons and how to find and use Creative Commons material. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/A2-finals.2.pdf">Stick up this poster (PDF)</a> in the classroom, as a reference tool for the different licence types.</p>
<p>To make this more interesting, encourage your students to enter <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/">Mix &amp; Mash: The New Storytelling</a>, organised by Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, the National Library and DigitalNZ.</p>
<h5>Can you come and talk about Creative Commons licensing?</h5>

<p>Sure. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/contact/" target="_blank">Get in touch</a> and we'll work something out--either in person, over videoconference or Skype. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MattMcGregor/creative-commons-for-schools">this slideshow</a> introduces some of the issues around copyright and Creative Commons licensing in schools.</p>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Quicksand_pic.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3553" title="Quicksand_pic" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Quicksand_pic.jpg" alt="" width="418" height="314"></a> Still from 'Quicksand,' 1950, directed by Irving Pichel, starring Mickey Rooney, <a href="http://archive.org/details/Quicksand_clear/">via The Internet Archive</a>. This film is in the public domain.
<p>While many people know about Creative Commons and public domain images, fewer people know about the vast range of high quality Creative Commons videos, available to be shared, remixed and reused. Here are some of the best ways to find clips or movies that are either licensed under Creative Commons or in the public domain.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Youtube</h4>

<p>Of course, no video list would go far without including Youtube. Check out Youtube's own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/creativecommons" target="_blank">Creative Commons corner</a>; otherwise, add a Creative Commons filter to your search.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Vimeo</h4>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/creativecommons" target="_blank">Vimeo</a> has over two million openly licensed videos. Happily, Vimeo also sort their videos according to the terms of the Creative Commons licence, which makes it easy for you to know exactly what kinds of permissions you've been given. The great thing about Vimeo is that they also make it easy for you to download your chosen video, in HD, SD and mobile quality. While you're there, you can also check out (and download) everyone's favourite video, <a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782" target="_blank">CC Kiwi</a>!</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Spin Xpress</h4>

<p><a href="http://spinxpress.com/" target="_blank">Spin Xpress</a> pulls Creative Commons licensed media from a variety of different websites, including Blip.tv, with simple search filters.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Internet Archive</strong></h4>

<p>If you're looking for videos in the public domain, <a href="http://archive.org/" target="_blank">The Internet Archive</a> is the place to go. While most people know about the WayBack Machine, which lets you check out earlier versions of the web, the most interesting part of The Internet Archive is its vast collection of media. Want to check out <a href="http://archive.org/details/DriveInMovieAds" target="_blank">bizarre drive-in movie ads</a>? What about <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2010/09/21/little-known-classics-you-need-to-watch/">old Hollywood movies</a> that have since passed into the public domain? What about films made by the <a href="http://archive.org/details/FedFlix" target="_blank">US Government</a> (including films produced by the CIA, like the '<a href="http://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.614513" target="_blank">Science of Spying</a>,' from 1965)? There are over a million such videos, many are which are available to share, remix and reuse.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Films About Creative Commons</h4>

<p>The Creative Commons community has put together dozens of short films <a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos" target="_blank">explaining the Creative Commons licences</a>, some of which are available on the Creative Commons site. While we tend to show off our own <a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782" target="_blank">CC Kiwi</a>, there are many more Creative Commons videos from around the world, including this '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1j0OA9N4hs" target="_blank">Meet Creative Commons</a>' from our friends at Creative Commons Qatar:</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P-bQB8zUSo]</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Creative Commons Wiki</h4>

<p>The Creative Commons community has put together <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Films" target="_blank">this list of films produced under a Creative Commons licence</a>, including the Academy Award winning documentary <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7402" target="_blank">A Story of Healing</a>.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"> DigitalNZ</h4>

<p>If you're looking for New Zealand material, your best bet is to check out <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a>. Open the search filter and click 'video' and select the usage rights you require.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/">Mix &amp; Mash</a> just around the corner, and with our interns looking to show off their skills and knowledge, we decided to rustle up a few new Creative Commons resources. We already had our <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/education/" target="_blank">education case studies</a>, our<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank"> brochure</a>, our <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank">A3 po</a><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank">st</a><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank">er</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/the-original-creative-commoners-teachers-and-open-educational-resources/" target="_blank">this post</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/understand-and-teach-creative-commons/" target="_blank">this other post</a>, as well as <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/creative-commons-for-new-zealand-schools/" target="_blank">this piece</a>, originally printed in the Education Gazette.</p>
<p>But we knew we needed more. So, we first released <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/copyright-creative-commons-mix-mash-lesson-plan/" target="_blank">our Mix &amp; Mash lesson plan</a>, which quickly became a popular resource for teachers looking to introduce Creative Commons licensing in the classroom.</p>
<p>We then released a slide show, introducing <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MattMcGregor/creative-commons-for-schools">Creative Commons licensing for New Zealand schools</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after that, we put up <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/A2-finals.2.pdf" target="_blank">our new Creative Commons poster</a>.</p>
<p>And today, you can share, remix and reuse <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Free-to-Mix.pdf">our new, 12 page Free to Mix guide</a>! We've released this in A5, making it easy for teachers and students to use: just set your printer to 'booklet' and 'double-sided' and you'll have your very own Free to Mix booklet.</p>

<p>As <a title="Copyright, CC and the Rise of MOOCs" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/copyright-cc-and-the-rise-of-moocs/" target="_blank">I wrote last year</a>, MOOCs have been in the news of late. In November, the New York Times went so far as to give their latest MOOC article the headline, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">The Year of the MOOC</a>. Closer to home, the cover story of <a href="http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/technology/online-learning-the-future-of-education/" target="_blank">the October 20 New Zeala</a><a href="http://www.listener.co.nz/current-affairs/technology/online-learning-the-future-of-education/" target="_blank">nd Listener (paywall)</a> discussed the potential ‘shakeup’ of higher education by online courses.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for that shakeup to occur: Over the summer, New Zealand’s own Open Educational Resources Foundation announced that the University of Southern Queensland would run <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Australia%27s_University_of_Southern_Queensland_launches_the_first_OERu_prototype" target="_blank">their own MOOC</a>--a foundational course in International Relations-- as part of the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" target="_blank">Open Educational Resources University (OERu)</a>,with academic credit for those who passed.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/120px-School_of_open_logo.png"><img class=" wp-image-3516 alignright" title="120px-School_of_open_logo" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/120px-School_of_open_logo.png" alt="" width="120" height="95"></a>Soon after, New Zealand’s <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Another_world_first_for_Otago_Polytechnic:_OP_to_offer_full_credential_for_the_OERu" target="_blank">Otago Polytechnic</a>, joining the Creative Commons birthday celebrations, announced that their new <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Another_world_first_for_Otago_Polytechnic:_OP_to_offer_full_credential_for_the_OERu" target="_blank">Graduate Diploma in Tertiary Education</a> would be offered as a full credential course on the OERu network. As with those offered by University of Southern Queensland, all course materials would be freely available under an open Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>And now, to coincide with <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_blank">Open Education Week</a> in March,<a href="https://p2pu.org/en/schools/school-of-open/" target="_blank"> the School of Open</a> is offering its first set of courses! <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36913" target="_blank">As Creative Commons' own Jane Park puts it</a>, the School runs volunteer courses on “the meaning and impact of ‘openness’ in the digital age and its benefit to creative endeavours, education, research and beyond.”</p>
<p>The first batch of courses includes Australian and US versions of ‘Copyright 4 Educators’ and an introduction to writing Wikipedia articles. Ten more courses—including those on open science, Creative Commons licences and open video—will also be launched after March 11.</p>
<p>If that’s not enough, OER Week events are also taking place across the world! Check out <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36913" target="_blank">this post from Jane Park at Creative Commons HQ</a> to learn more.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Lillian Grace, founder of Wiki New Zealand, wants New Zealanders to make informed decisions. To this end, Lillian and others have uploaded a bunch of graphs and thematic maps based on public data to <a href="http://wikinewzealand.org/" target="_blank">wikinewzealand.org</a>, a new collaborative website.</p>
<p>While some of the data is used with permission, all of the content by Wiki New Zealand itself is made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand Licence</a>.</p>
<p>Lillian had the idea for Wiki New Zealand in February 2012, while working for the <a href="http://www.nzinstitute.org/" target="_blank">New Zealand Institute</a>. While giving talks to community and business groups, Lillian realised that,<del cite="mailto:Matt%20McGregor" datetime="2013-02-25T09:35"></del> “Every single issue that we addressed would have been easier to deal with if more people understood the basic facts.</p>
<p>“That’s one of the driving forces for me behind Wiki New Zealand. I’m concerned for New Zealand’s future and I think that the best chance we have of getting the best outcomes is if more people are informed and can make informed decisions.”</p>
<p>Lillian is especially interested in connecting people to public data in such a way that “doesn’t require them to have a great deal of time or skill.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen the power of informed decisions. I’ve seen the light go on in people when they learn something that they didn’t know.”</p>
<p>To help more New Zealander’s find out about their country, Lillian decided to apply a Creative Commons Attribution licence to all Wiki New Zealand content. This licence allows users to share and adapt Wiki New Zealand content, as long as they provide attribution.</p>
<p>As Lillian puts it, “Creative Commons seemed like a natural fit because it seems like its purposes are very aligned with Wiki New Zealand’s purposes. I never actually considered not using it.”</p>
<p>“I really believe in sharing data and information. I like Creative Commons. Part of it is the language that it uses. It seems like its purpose is very clear. It’s a very sensible structure. It’s not scary to use. I felt very safe and responsible, like I was doing the right thing. This is very important when it comes to copyright, which can be quite daunting.”</p>
<p>Wiki New Zealand will soon add individual licensing statements for each graph, to ensure that users know exactly what they can do with Wiki New Zealand’s source data. While most content is sourced from New Zealand government agencies using Creative Commons licences, some of the content is made available under a more restrictive licensing agreement. “Some of the sources are fully open, like <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Statistics New Zealand</a>, but some sources only let their data be reproduced for free if it’s not for commercial use.”</p>
<p>Lillian is planning to introduce the full wiki functionality to the site in May. “When it’s a proper wiki, registered users will be able to add data for graphs themselves.”</p>
<p>“Imagine a scientist in the South Island collecting bacteria samples in fresh water—that’s great information. I’d be interested in knowing about that. But there has not been any mechanism to easily and regularly share such data with the public. Wiki New Zealand will enable them to submit their data in an online visual form that can be viewed and valued by the rest of the country.</p>
<p>“The process will be audited for content accuracy and impartiality, and the graphs are dynamically generated with a consistent look and feel to make them as easy as possible to make and digest.”</p>
<p>Lillian is hoping for a wide range of innovative reuse. “Anyone can do anything with the information Wiki New Zealand provides, as long as they abide by the licensing of the original sources. We’re providing our graphs in a range of different formats. Journalists can download the graphs and add their own branding, as long as they attribute the sources and Wiki New Zealand. They can repackage it how they like.”</p>
<p>To help promote the site, Lillian has introduced a ‘<a href="http://wikinewzealand.org/?cat=69" target="_blank">Know Your Country</a>’ feature, which tests users’ knowledge about New Zealand.</p>
<p>While the site will be extremely useful for teachers and journalists, Lillian hopes that it will appeal to all New Zealanders. “It’s hard to pinpoint specific users, as it really is for everyone.”</p>
<p>“I want it to infiltrate the culture, to make it cool to know your country, to make it normal to know your country.”</p>

<h5>By Holly Grover</h5>
<p>The beauty of doing research on open culture is that a wealth of case studies, conferences, discussions and blog posts is always available online – usually under a CC-license. Unsurprisingly, finding arguments <em>against</em> Open GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) has been somewhat more challenging--mostly because of journal paywalls.  A handful of these are summarised below, though there is undoubtedly much more to discover. For those with an interest and stake in our cultural institutions, the debate over open GLAMs is a fascinating one to follow.</p>
<p><a href="http://openglam.org/files/2012/04/OpenGLAM-logo.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3471 " title="OpenGLAM-logo" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/OpenGLAM-logo-211x300.png" alt="" width="211" height="300"></a> <a href="http://openglam.org/files/2012/04/OpenGLAM-logo.png">'Open GLAM logo'</a> by the Open Knowledge Foundation is made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported licence</a></p>
<p>Open GLAMs is a growing movement, with developments and events taking place around the globe. Joris Pekel, presenting at the EVA/MINERVA digital heritage conference in Israel, provides a good <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DM2E/openglam-minerva-15112012"> introduction to Open GLAMs</a>, including the opportunities and challenges presented by open content. Over in the UK, the annual Open Culture conference webpage features videos, presentations, and resources from their <a href="http://www.collectionslink.org.uk/videos-presentations-and-resources-from-oc2011">2011</a> and <a href="http://www.collectionslink.org.uk/presentations-and-resources">2012</a> events. Here in New Zealand, we’ve had the National Digital Forum, and for those who missed it, the talks from past conferences are <a href="http://www.ndf.org.nz/past-conferences/category/2012">available online</a>.</p>
<p>In the US, the <a href="http://openglam.org/">Open GLAM blog</a> provides up-to-date summaries of the events, arguments, and developments in the cultural heritage sector. Amongst these posts is an eloquent argument from Nick Poole, CEO of the Collections Trust in the U.K., who presents <a href="http://www.collectionslink.org.uk/blog/1536-culture-must-always-be-a-commons">a strong case for open culture</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“I would argue that in many ways our industry, the 'cultural heritage sector', has more or less operated as a Commons for decades. The principle of the Commons is written into our language - the language of the Public Realm, of accepting custodianship of material and intellectual culture on behalf of society, of culture as a civic duty. Public institutions accepting title to material culture on behalf of the wider public are accepting that material into a Commons, on the principle that the public will continue to enjoy the right to engage with and benefit from it.”</p>

<p>Poole pushes for the opening up and digitalisation of collections, increasing opportunities for public interaction. He is also well aware of the challenges facing the cultural heritage sector:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“I am not suggesting that museums, archives or libraries unilaterally assert <em>all</em> of their knowledge and collections into the Public Domain - we have to support a stable process of transition to new, more sustainable economic models.”</p>

<p>This transition is well underway, especially in large cultural institutions such as the <a href="http://openglam.org/2013/01/22/walters-art-museum-a-case-study-in-sharing/">Walters Art Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/">Europeana</a> (a portal for digitised collections throughout Europe), and closer to home, the <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/items?i%5bcategory%5d=Images">National Library of New Zealand</a>  and <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/">Te Papa</a>.</p>
<p>While these organisations are leading the way, it is widely recognised that many GLAMs face challenges in following their example. It may be a lack of human resources, insufficient staff training or budgetary constraints. There are concerns about intellectual property and copyright, especially as image reproductions are frequently relied on to generate income (although many question the validity of copyrighting <em>reproductions</em> of works in the first place, especially of those in the public domain).</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The_Bard.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3475  " title="The_Bard" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The_Bard-238x300.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="300"></a> <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Bard.jpg">The Bard</a> by John Martin, 1817, is in the Public Domain. Made available via Wikimedia Commons, the image is housed in the <a href="http://britishart.yale.edu/">Yale Center for British Art</a>.</p>
<p>In light of (and despite) these obstacles, the <a href="http://www.nmc.org/pdf/2012-horizon-report-museum.pdf">NMC Horizon Report: 2012 Museum Edition</a> predicts that in two to three years’ time open content will have gained critical momentum amongst museums. The report stresses that in order to achieve this, GLAMs will need a “comprehensive digital strategy,” and a Board of Trustees and executive management who recognise the importance of technology “in an era when audiences expect to consume information whenever and wherever they want.”</p>
<p>The NMC report also discusses opening up pedagogies and behind-the-scenes activity to spur public interest in Museums: a practice exemplified by the <a href="http://museum.wiki.nmc.org/">open access wiki</a> used during the creation of the Horizon report. The idea of public and custodian interaction is taken further by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM">GLAM-Wiki</a> initiative, which was designed to combine the expertise of staff with the global reach of Wikipedia – see this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/arts/design/05wiki.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;">case study</a> on the British Museum.</p>
<p>Cultural heritage institutions, summarises the Open GLAM blog, “are having to re-think the way they license material and share it with the public.” The NMC report sees this as an opportunity for GLAMs to lead the way in open culture:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">“New intellectual property licensing options have resulted in some museums rethinking the dissemination of content. Many in museums believe that they should be at the forefront of open content modeling — illustrating how best to share content, establish standards, and take part in the global conversations about policy, the Creative Commons, and open culture.”</p>

<h5>By Matt McGregor</h5>
<p><a href="http://jonlemmonmusic.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Jon Lemmon</a> is a songwriter and musician based in Wellington, New Zealand. His latest album, Demos/Sketches, was released in 2011 under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commerical 3.0 licence</a>.</p>
<p>Jon used the same licence to release his other albums, including<a href="http://jonlemmonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/singles-2010" target="_blank"> Singles</a>, <a href="http://jonlemmonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/kindling-ep" target="_blank">Kindling EP</a> and <a href="http://jonlemmonmusic.bandcamp.com/track/steppenwolf-pg-247-wet-wings-remix" target="_blank">Steppenwolf</a>, also available for free download.</p>
<p>As Jon puts it, he uses Creative Commons for “everything, really. I’m a bedroom producer, and do all of it on my computer—recording, writing songs, singing, all of that—and to me, it didn’t really ever seem like a question whether or not I’d use Creative Commons.”</p>
<iframe style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1201170730/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" width="400" height="100" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Jon was encouraged to use Creative Commons licensing by VBC radio host Kim Wheatley, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CompulsoryEx/info?ref=stream" target="_blank">host of Compulsory Ecstasy</a>, who was living with Jon at the time. Kim was reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a> and saw open licensing as an interesting wayfor Jon to release his music.</p>
<p>Jon points out that most bedroom artists don’t spend much time thinking about copyright. “If you’re young enough, you just assume everything’s fair game, especially if you grew up with bands like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Talk_(musician)" target="_blank">GirlTalk</a>. In the underground scene, the blogosphere and stuff like that, if it’s not mainstream, it seems like people don’t really care about copyright.”</p>
<p>“As an artist, I find copyright really obnoxious. I’m really interested in the idea of people sharing their music, so that people m can do whatever they want with it, and what you end up producing is a great mix of a whole bunch of work.”</p>
<p>“There was no question there, I wanted to open the album up for remix.”</p>
<p>Opening up the album, however, required more than just a Creative Commons licence. “You still only have a full song, and you don’t have the individual tracks and parts to sample. One of the most recent songs—<a href="http://jonlemmonmusic.bandcamp.com/track/exodus-i-demo" target="_blank">Exodus</a>—I released of the individual tracks for it as well, just in case anyone wanted to do anything with any of it.”</p>
<iframe style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1203011011/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" width="400" height="100" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>“No one ever commented on it, and I didn’t even know if anyone even saw it or used it at all, but then randomly I was at a show, and some person came up to me and said, ‘hey, I really like your music. It was so awesome that you released all the tracks for that one song. I’ve been playing around with it.’"</p>
<p>Jon, however, is quick to point out that the purpose of Creative Commons is to provide a legal framework for a culture of sharing, remix and reuse that already exists. As Jon puts it, “cultural protection always works better than legal protection.”</p>
<p>Other examples of reuse include Jon and New Zealand duo <a href="http://wetwings.lilchiefrecords.com/">Wet Wings</a> remixing each other’s openly licensed work.</p>
<iframe style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1256450403/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" width="400" height="100" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>In 2011, Jon found out that “someone had done <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsn9dvRNLY8">an edit of my song and put it on Youtube</a>, which was cool.”</p>
<p>This turned out to be <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cocobrycebeats">Coco Bryce</a>, an international remix artist. As Jon relates, “He then did another edit, released that, and then got in touch and said, ‘Hey, I’m talking to this record label about releasing this as a single. Would you be interested?’</p>
<p>“I agreed, so he said, ‘we’ll put your original on, my remix on and then we’ll do a version together and put that on, too.’ So that’s what we did.”</p>
<p>The record was released by <a href="http://www.carcrashset.com/releases_ccs2045.php">Car Crash Set in 2011</a>. “That’s the only one of my tracks that’s available from a record label.”</p>
<p>Jon found Creative Commons particularly useful in specifying exactly what kinds of permissions he wanted to allow. “I want to be able to make sure everyone can edit this. But if someone tries to profit from my music, I want to be able set the terms. That was actually really nice—it meant that I was safe, legally.”</p>
<p>I asked Jon whether the culture of remix among bedroom producers included providing attribution. As Jon replied, “you’d be stupid not to. It’s about building relationships. Creative Commons—that concept—is just sensible... It’s the sensible way to do things.”</p>
