<p>MEDIA RELEASE 13 February 2014</p>
<p>The Media Text Hack Group is proud to release v1 of the hacked Media Studies Textbook, following a highly successful remote collaboration with participants from across New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>The project was spearheaded by Dr Erika Pearson, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Media, Film and Communication  University of Otago. As Pearson explains, “the textbook is designed to be used by students in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific. To this end, the textbook includes nearly fifty entries on a range of topics and issues common to curricula across the region.”</p>
<p>“We’ve also released the text book under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. This means that educators and students can adapt and rewrite the textbook using their own examples and explanations, without having to ask our permission in advance.”</p>
<p>Inspired by similar projects around the world, and supported by funding from Creative Commons, the Media Text Hack Group sought to act as ‘curators’ of the vast array of information about media and communication, and drew together examples specific to the region.</p>
<p>The text can be read linearly, like a book, and the online format also means that readers can also dive in and out of sections as they wish, following hypertext links across the material and out to useful information across the web.</p>
<p>As Richard White, Copyright Officer at the University of Otago, puts it, "This is a real 21st century textbook - I hesitate to even use that word - that harnesses the power of the web to break out of the print model we've had for the last several hundred years.  It's open access, which means a lot of different things: it's free; anyone can read it, use it, adapt it; it's also open to wider scrutiny, which helps improve it over time."</p>
<p>This first release represents a core of work based on the common curricula of media and communication studies programs across the region.  It is hoped that future versions will develop and expand these areas, as well as take advantage of new tools of collaboration and sharing.  All are welcome to take, use, recycle and adapt the material under the Creative Commons Attribution licence.</p>
<p>"It's great to see an initiative like this coming out of the Humanities, where most similar examples have been in Science disciplines,” says White.</p>
<p>"Erika's team have really achieved something wonderful here.  As far as we know this is the first initiative of its kind in NZ, and in this discipline, perhaps even the world.”</p>
<p>This release will soon be followed by a ‘cookbook’ which will discuss the process of developing the book.</p>
<p>As Pearson puts it, “this cookbook will hopefully guide and inspire others to produce their own open educational resources.  Open textbooks ensure that educational resources are accessible, affordable and reusable, helping communities to realise the goal of enabling universal access to education.”</p>

<h4>By Hannah Mettner</h4>
<p><em>In 2009, we published <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2009/06/671/" target="_blank">a quick case study</a> of NZ On Screen, which was then only two years old. With the launch of its sister site, Audio Culture, in 2013, we thought we'd take the opportunity to revisit both projects. Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ intern Hannah Mettner sat down with NZ On Screen Project Director Clarion Coughlan.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/" target="_blank">NZ On Screen</a> has provided online access to a wealth of New Zealand film, television and music video since 2008. From the outset they’ve used a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial</a> licence for all the work they put into the site. While the video content belongs to the rightsholders, all the synopses, backgrounds and biographies relating to videos and people is licensed under CC. And this material is impressive in its scope and quality; the introductions to the collections, particularly, are personable as well as thorough.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3769054349_9b22d1bd7d_z.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5155" alt="3769054349_9b22d1bd7d_z" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/3769054349_9b22d1bd7d_z-300x206.jpg" width="300" height="206"></a> Rock Concert, 1962, by Eric Calonius. <a href="http://arcweb.archives.gov/arc/action/ExternalIdSearch?id=553890&amp;jScript=true" target="_blank">US National Archives</a>, via Flickr. No known copyright.</p>
<p>Clarion, the Project Director, talks about how they want to make the content <i>work</i>; their aim is not to put everything they possibly can online, but rather to choose culturally significant pieces and give them space to talk to each other.</p>
<p>NZ On Screen is a curated website, carefully chosen and added to, and the context provided by the written material is crucial. Clarion says “rather than just publishing videos, we contextualise them through our writing. As NZ On Screen has been paid for by tax payers (via NZ On Air funding), it makes sense to make that writing available under Creative Commons: To give something back”.</p>
<p>Having that CC licensed work reused also serves as a useful advertising tool; when writers reuse their pieces on blogs or have them published elsewhere, and actors’ agencies reuse what is effectively a pre-written biography, the CC licence brings people back to the NZ On Screen website.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the popularity of NZ On Screen, May 2013 saw the launch of a sister project, <a href="http://www.audioculture.co.nz/" target="_blank">Audio Culture</a> – the ‘noisy library of New Zealand music’. The site aims to address the ‘digital silence’ that has surrounded New Zealand music online, and to collect together the stories, multimedia and ephemera that have contributed to NZ music from the last 100 years.</p>
<p>AudioCulture kicked off with 250 pages of people, labels and scenes, all under searchable indexes, plus music, interviews and photographs, with another 300 pages following in the second year. It was certainly very well-received, gaining 25,000 page views in its first month live.</p>
<p>Following the successful formula employed over at NZ On Screen, the music on the site is licensed by PPNZ Music Licensing and APRA/AMCOS and the images have been cleared with copyright owners, but the written content in Profiles, Stories, Labels and Scenes all falls under the CC-BY-NC licence. Like the written content on NZ On Screen, these pieces are not brief introductions; they are well-researched and in-depth, written by a wide variety of contributors, often with a personal connection to the subject, providing an extraordinary depth of context.</p>

<h5>By Conal Thompson</h5>
<p>It is a common misconception that copyright in a work needs to be registered in order to be recognised. The truth is that in New Zealand copyright exists as soon as a work is created, and whether or not copyright does exist in a work is determined by a set of rules established by the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345634.html" target="_blank">Copyright Act 1994.</a></p>
<p>The distinct lack of formalities required by copyright law has increasingly become an issue with the rise (to use a favourite term of journalists and academics) of the “scary internet machine-monster” (okay, I made that one up).</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Monster-Soup.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5147 " alt="V0011218 An woman dropping her tea-cup in horror u" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Monster-Soup.jpg" width="321" height="218"></a> Not a scary internet machine-monster, but close enough. "<a href="http://www.wellcomecollection.org/explore/sickness--health/topics/epidemics/images.aspx?view=a-monster-soup" target="_blank">Monster Soup commonly called Thames Water</a>" by William Heath, London, 1828, via Wellcome Library / Wellcome Images. Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales License .</p>
<p>What's the issue? Take, for instance, a picture that I draw of the “scary internet machine-monster” that I then publish online. From the second that I publish it, copyright exists in that drawing, which is owned by me.</p>
<p>This is regardless of whether or not I put my name to it, place a little ©-symbol next to it, or provide any details that can easily trace the drawing back to its creator (me).</p>
<p>Let's say I chose not to do any of those things when I published it. This is what many people do (or to put it better, don’t do) when they publish their work online. Such a work is known as an “orphan work” – meaning the owner of copyright is difficult to find or untraceable.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that if my picture became really popular and other people wanted to use it, the lack of information I provide with the picture makes it difficult for those people to contact me and gain my permission to use it.</p>
<p>This won’t prevent the spread of the picture onto other websites that make no money from it – but what if a big-shot clothing manufacturer decided they wanted to pay me to put my drawing onto t-shirts that they sell? Unfortunately for me, that lucrative deal won’t be making its way into my bank account, because I didn’t provide details of who owns the copyright, and the spread of the picture onto a multitude of other websites would have made it virtually impossible for the manufacturer to track down its origin.</p>
<p>If I applied a Creative Commons license to it, however, then it would make it a lot easier for other users to trace its ownership back to me. Say that I wanted my drawing to be able to be shared and easily attributable back to me – I would add a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">CC BY-NC licence </a>to it, so that others could use it but not make any money from it.</p>
<p>This means I still have the exclusive right to commercially benefit from it, meaning that big-shot clothing manufacturer can still come knocking at my door and I can still earn reward for my work – most of all because this time around, they know where to find me.</p>
<p>Note: In 2013, the Berkeley School of Law hosted a symposium on this very issue, called “<a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/formalities.htm" target="_blank">Reform(aliz)ing Copyright for the Internet Age</a>”. If you’re interested in the legal and political debate surrounding the establishment of formalities for copyright law then head over there and take a look.</p>

<p>[<em>For the first few weeks of 2014, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been joined by three talented interns, Hannah Mettner, Conal Thompson and Sun Jeong. They're making new Creative Commons resources, writing case studies, editing our upcoming CC book and researching the use of CC licensing in the cultural sector. Hannah, a writer and editor, has been reading and editing the 40+ case studies of New Zealand CC licence users. Here are some of her reflections]</em></p>
<p></p>
<h5>By Hannah Mettner</h5>
<p>For the last week, I’ve been going through<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/case-studies/" target="_blank"> the case studies</a> we’ve collected over the years as individuals and organisations have begun to use Creative Commons licences, and I’ve noticed a few trends. Here they are…</p>
<h5><em>1. People love using CC</em></h5>

<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Attribution.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5085" alt="Attribution" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Attribution.jpg" width="190" height="190"></a>It really does seem that once people use/experience CC they love it. There’s a growing attitude of generosity around information, and to me, more interestingly, creativity. A lot of people are saying stuff like “it works fantastically for us”, and that they’re “inclined to start from a default position of ‘everything should be open’”. Just imagine!</p>
<h5><em>2. CC helps increase visibility and reuse</em></h5>

<p>Organisations are noticing a massive increase in visibility and usage upon making data available online with CC licence. Some report user numbers increasing by 1000% in a single year.</p>
<h5><em>3. CC saves time</em></h5>

<p>Another commonality is that having information CC licensed online frees up time for employees. Rather than having to manually address requests for information every time they’re received, they could focus on other things. AND because they don’t have to spend time preparing the information, they don’t need to charge for it.</p>
<h5><em>4. CC can help artists commercially</em></h5>

<p>Artists using CC licensing have initially begun doing so for the social-creative implications; it’s exciting for them to have others experience and reuse their work. But wider exposure can mean increased commercial gain as an added benefit. Some artists are posting work to the internet during its creation and making the final piece available for purchase. Some have non-commercial licences but have had work picked up and paid for by big-name companies.  And many of them are remixing and reusing and being inspired by one another!</p>

<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is proud to announce the winners of the <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/">Mix &amp; Mash 2013</a>, New Zealand’s great remix competition.</p>
<p>The open award has been won by Graham Jenson for ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/may-showcase/supreme-award-may-showcase-highly-commended">Mihimihi</a>’, an interactive timeline that traces Jenson’s family history back to the dawn of humanity.</p>
<p>The open award was judged by Lawrence Lessig, Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School and founding Board Member of Creative Commons.</p>
<p>“There is something impossibly difficult about the telescoping nature of the story,” said Lessig. “The combination of the two perspectives — the timeline and then video — create a powerful impression.”</p>
<p>Graham Jenson win $2000 in prizes, courtesy of <a href="http://www.squiz.net/nz">Squiz</a>.</p>
<p>The student award was taken out by ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/showcase/supreme-award-november-showcase-student-award">Tane's Tale</a>’ by Georgia, Nicole and Rachel Chappell from Christchurch, an ambitious, detailed and compelling story about the New Zealand environment.</p>
<p>Judge Chris Harwood from the Ministry of Education said that the “The original poem told a story that has happened many times in many contexts, and explored how cultural and economic perspectives must coexist for a sustainable future.”</p>
<p>Harwood also praised the story’s “quirky humour with NZ icons appearing unexpected on the screen—red band gumboots and pineapple lumps! I found myself looking for the next one!”</p>
<p>The Chappell sisters win $2000 in prizes, courtesy of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Transport Agency’s Safer Journeys Award went to students from Pt England School in Auckland for their clever video <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/august-showcase/commended---safer-journeys">Safer Journeys: Using our feet</a>.</p>
<p>Mix &amp; Mash would like to thank our November judges Rob Coup (Koordinates), Dylan Horrocks (author and cartoonist) and Karen Melhuish-Spencer (Core Education).</p>
<p>Organised by Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, DigitalNZ and the National Library of New Zealand and enabled by a range of sponsors and partners, Mix &amp; Mash 2013 celebrates the creative reuse of data and content from New Zealand’s rich cultural heritage.</p>

<h4>Collaboration</h4>

<p>“Without sharing, there is no education”</p>
<p>– David Wiley.</p>
<p>As anyone who works in education knows, all teachers share and collaborate. From swapping lesson plans to re<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CC-brochure.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4925" alt="CC brochure" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CC-brochure-300x274.png" width="300" height="274"></a>using  assignments, teachers are constantly looking to make better resources by building on each other’s work.</p>
<p>The good news is that this is getting easier. With the Internet and digital technologies, there is a much wider pool of teachers to collaborate with— and, in turn, a much richer range of reusable digital resources. With over 2,500 schools and 53,000 teachers working in New Zealand state funded schools, the potential is enormous.</p>
<h4>Copyright</h4>

<p>By default, the copyright in resources made by most kiwi teachers in the course of their employment is held by their respective Boards of Trustees (their employers.) Legally, this means that teachers have to ask permission from their Board of Trustees before they can share their resources.</p>
<p>As more teaching and learning is done online, it’s essential that teachers have permission to legally share and collaborate. This is why Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, following the lead of NZGOAL, is recommending that each Board of Trustees adopt a Creative Commons policy giving all school teachers advance permission to legally share their resources for reuse.</p>
<h4>NZGOAL</h4>

<p>Approved by Cabinet in July 2010, NZGOAL (the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework) advocates the use of Creative Commons licences for copyright works released by State Services agencies, including New Zealand schools.<strong></strong></p>
<h4>Creative Commons</h4>

<p>Creative Commons is an international non-profit, with projects in over seventy countries. Creative Commons provides free, legally robust licences that allow copyright owners to give permission for their work to be shared and reused. A Creative Commons licence tells other people what they can do with your work.</p>
<p>Creative Commons licences are being used everywhere—from the White House and Wikipedia to the New Zealand Government—to enable content and data to be shared and reused.</p>
<h4>Creative Commons Policy</h4>

<p>A Creative Commons policy approved by your Board of Trustees will enable teachers at your school to share their teaching resources under a Creative Commons licence. A Creative Commons policy will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage teachers at your school to legally share and collaborate online;</li>

    <li>Ensure that when teachers leave, both the teacher and the school retain access to all teaching resources;</li>

    <li>Enable NZ teachers to spend more time adapting high quality resources, and less time reinventing the wheel.</li>

</ul>
<p>“Teachers are collaborating more, and they’re also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources.” – Mark Osborne,  Albany Senior High School</p>

<h4>Who are you looking for?</h4>

<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) is looking for two paid interns to help out over the summer.</p>
<p>The first intern will be a talented designer or visual artist, keen to produce a range of CCANZ resources for print and the web.</p>
<p>The second intern will be a confident and engaging writer from either law, the humanities or related disciplines, willing to write blog posts, conduct interviews for Creative Commons case studies and help plan the production of new Creative Commons resources.</p>
<p>Both interns will be energetic supporters of open licensing and open culture, capable of working both collaboratively and independently. While all students are encouraged to apply, the successful candidates are likely to be in at least their third year of study.</p>
<h4>Where? When? And how much?</h4>

<p>Interns will be paid $15 per hour. We hope to provide a total of at least 60 hours paid work. Interns will never be expected to work for free, though there may be opportunities to volunteer after the duration of the internship.<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3530 alignright" alt="Remix Kiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi-300x300.jpg" width="181" height="181"></a></p>
<p>Ideally, the successful candidates will work between ten and twenty hours per week, between 8.30am and 5pm, at the Thorndon home of the Royal Society of New Zealand. Both interns will work under the direct supervision of the Public Lead for CCANZ. Ideally, the internship will run sometime between January 15 to February 28, though we are willing to be flexible to accommodate other commitments.</p>
<p>The successful candidates will be temporary employees of the Royal Society of New Zealand, which hosts the CCANZ project. Regrettably, CCANZ is unable to provide accommodation in Wellington, and candidates should note that their pay is unlikely to cover living costs in the Wellington area.</p>
<h4>What’s Creative Commons?</h4>

<p>CCANZ is the kaitiaki of the Creative Commons licences in Aotearoa New Zealand. We promote openness across culture, education, science and government. Browse our website for more information about what we do.</p>
<h4>What will I be doing?</h4>

<p>On top of some basic administrative tasks, you’ll be working on a number of exciting Creative Commons projects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing and designing a range of resources for CCANZ;</li>

    <li>writing blog posts on the CCANZ website;</li>

    <li>working with the CCANZ community;</li>

    <li>organising Creative Commons events;</li>

    <li>interviewing and writing case studies; and,</li>

    <li>helping with the preliminary work in producing a Creative Commons book.</li>

</ul>
<p>You’ll also be involved in discussions with the Public Lead on what Creative Commons might do in the future.</p>
<h4>How do I apply?</h4>

<p>To apply, email Matt McGregor at matt.mcgregor@royalsociety.org.nz</p>
<p>Design or arts applicants should provide a short CV and a portfolio or links to examples of your work. It's really important that we see some examples of your work.</p>
<p>Law and/or humanities applicants should provide a short CV and cover letter. We'll be favouring applicants who show genuine interest in and understanding of the work Creative Commons.</p>
<p>Applications close noon Tuesday 10 December.</p>

<p></p>
<p>[<em>This is the media release for the Media Text Hack, completed on the weekend of 16-17 November. The project was covered by the <a href="http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/281800/textbook-project-internet">ODT</a>, <a href="http://techday.com/educate/news/academics-to-hack-an-open-textbook/173459/">Techday</a> and</em> <a href="http://www.idealog.co.nz/blog/2013/11/need-better-textbook-hack-it-yourself"><em>Idealog</em>]</a></p>
<p>On the weekend of 16-17 November, a group of academics across Australia and New Zealand are getting together at their respective campuses to collaboratively write – or ‘hack’ – <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/texthack/about-the-project/" target="_blank">an open textbook</a>.</p>
<p>Led by Dr Erika Pearson, Richard White and Simon Hart at the University of Otago – with assistance from Bernard Madill – the open textbook project will be an experiment in the production of open educational resources in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>This textbook will be for undergraduate students in Communication and Media Studies around Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific.</p>
<p>With contributions from academics across New Zealand and Australia, the textbook will be free of all technical and legal restrictions on access and reuse. This means that it will free for by anyone in the world to read, distribute and adapt.</p>
<p>As Dr Pearson, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Media, Film and Communication, says, “Textbooks currently available for New Zealand first year students are often produced overseas, usually the US, and can have a cripplingly high price tag.</p>
<p>“Open texts are not only more affordable for students, they also are more flexible for teachers, who can pull apart open textbooks to find the more relevant and useful materials for their classes.”</p>
<p>University of Otago Copyright Officer Richard White agrees. “I often get questions from staff about using various types of materials for teaching purposes.  Often with closed resources, restricted by all-rights-reserved copyright, staff get frustrated that they can’t provide a good resource to students in the way they want because of cost or difficulty in contacting – or event identifying – the rights holder.”</p>
<p>White sees the open textbook projects as a return to the “core principles of academia: sharing knowledge, learning from and building on the work of others.”</p>
<p>The open textbook will use a Creative Commons Attribution licence, enabling anyone to share, adapt and rewrite the textbook, as long as credit is given to the original creators. Creative Commons International is partially funding the project, through a grant to Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>White says that Creative Commons licensing “is the perfect vehicle. It ensures our rights as creators are preserved while at the same time enabling others to share our work as widely as possible.”</p>
<p>“Open textbooks, using Creative Commons licensing, are flexible. They don't force you to fit other people's pedagogy,” says Dr Pearson.</p>
<p>The team was inspired by a group of Finnish mathematicians who successfully wrote <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34643" target="_blank">an open mathematics textbook in a weekend.</a></p>
<p>The team hopes that their project will inspire other open textbooks in the region. As Dr Pearson puts it, “This is why we are producing in parallel a 'cookbook,' to give detailed tips and advice for anyone who wants to attempt a similar project.”</p>
<p>For White, the project will “allow students in our region to access a work in their own cultural paradigm and for others to build on it.  And we think that recording the process and telling people what worked and what didn’t is just as important as the text itself.</p>
<p>“This is a new way to produce work like this and we’ll all be learning a lot as we go.  It’s a real challenge but really exciting at the same time.”</p>

<p>Led by Erika Pearson, Richard White and Simon Hart at the University of Otago – with assistance from Bernard Madill – the open textbook project will be an experiment in the production of open educational resources in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>The team was inspired by a group of Finnish mathematicians who (successfully) attempted to write<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34643" target="_blank"> an open mathematics textbook in a weekend.</a></p>
<p>An 'open' textbook is one which is free of all technical and legal restrictions on access and reuse. That means a textbook that is free to read, free to adapt and free to distribute – all over the world.</p>
<p>This initial textbook project will be for undergraduate students in Communication and Media Studies around Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific. In the future, though, we could see open textbook projects for subjects and levels across the New Zealand education system.</p>
<p>To this end, the organising team are producing an accompanying 'cookbook'' to provide a roadmap for other projects.</p>
<p>The project is partially funded by Creative Commons, who have been supporting open education projects around the world. Creative Commons affiliates, for their part, have been working to implement open education projects and policies -- with a great deal of success.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CCvid.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4882 alignright" alt="CCvid" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CCvid-300x253.jpg" width="199" height="167"></a>In Latin America, <a href="http://www.latinproject.org/index.php/en/project-overview" target="_blank">Project LATIN</a> is working to produce open textbooks to address the affordability of educational resources. As the project home points out, annual textbook costs for an undergraduate at the Universidade de São Paulo add up to 67% of the Brazilian minimum wage. "This," the members of Project LATIN point out, "makes [it] almost impossible for low-income families to support university study."</p>
<p>In Europe, the <a href="http://oerpolicy.eu/reflections-on-our-oer-policy-workshop-in-berlin/" target="_blank">Open Education Policy Network</a> is making the case to governments across the continent that free content licences -- like CC BY or CC BY SA -- "should be adopted for all publicly funded educational content." Projects are already in place: <a href="http://creativecommons.pl/open-educational-resources-in-the-digital-school-program/" target="_blank">Poland</a> and Macedonia have been producing state-funded open textbooks for the compulsory sector, and other countries have developed repositories for open educational resources, like the Belgian <a href="http://klascement.info/">Klascement</a>, Dutch <a href="http://www.wikiwijs.nl/">Wikiwijs</a> and Norwegian <a href="http://ndla.no/">NDLA. </a></p>
<p>On August 13, the Indian Government launched <a href="http://nroer.in/home/" target="_blank">NROER</a>, a repository for providing open educational resources for the Indian school sector. in Mongolia, <a href="http://www.one.mn/" target="_blank">the One Academy</a> is translating and creating open resources.</p>
<p>In North America, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34288" target="_blank">California</a> and<a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34566" target="_blank"> British Columbia</a> have both announced plans to use open textbooks for high enrolment courses. And then the Department of Labor and the Department of Educationin the US announced $2 billion to create open educational resources for US community colleges.</p>
<p>Closer to home, the <a href="http://oeruniversity.org/">Open Educational Resources university has launched</a>, which uses open textbooks to teach -- and provide credit -- for university courses.</p>
<p>And that really is just the beginning: there are major open educational resources projects in just about every country on the planet. Open textbooks are clearly taking off -- and for good reason. Open textbooks ensure that educational resources are accessible, affordable and reusable, helping organisations and governments to realise their basic goal of enabling universal access to education.</p>
<p>It's exciting to see the global movement for open textbooks reach New Zealand. May this open textbook project be the first of many!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/450px-OERu-logo-white.png"><img class=" wp-image-4818 aligncenter" alt="450px-OERu-logo-white" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/450px-OERu-logo-white.png" width="434" height="108"></a></p>
<p>During <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/oa-week-2012/" target="_blank">Open Access Week 2012</a>,  Dr Wayne Mackintosh, a long-serving member of the Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ advisory panel, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/the-oer-university/" target="_blank">detailed an ambitious plan</a>: <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" target="_blank">the OERu</a>, a credit-providing university based entirely on open educational resources.</p>
<p>One year later, a slew of tertiary institutions have signed up, including New Zealand's own Wintec and Lincoln University, as well as institutions from Canada, Ireland, South Africa, UK, among others.</p>
<p>This might sound a bit like the other<a title="Copyright, CC and the Rise of MOOCs" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/copyright-cc-and-the-rise-of-moocs/" target="_blank"> MOOCs that have recei</a><a title="Copyright, CC and the Rise of MOOCs" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/copyright-cc-and-the-rise-of-moocs/" target="_blank">ved so much </a><a title="Copyright, CC and the Rise of MOOCs" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/copyright-cc-and-the-rise-of-moocs/" target="_blank">media attention</a>. The OERu, however, is different to most MOOCs.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the OERu is truly open: its courses are openly accessible, its resources are openly licensed and its operations and governance are entirely transparent. As a <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Core_principles_of_engagement" target="_blank">core principle of engagement</a>, anchor partners commit to releasing educational resources under one of the<a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Definition" target="_blank"> free cultural works approved</a> CC licenses (that's Creative Commons Attribution or Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike).</p>
<p>Second, the OERu is committed to offering students <em>credit.</em> This is a remarkable innovation, and New Zealand institutions have been the first to try it out. In late 2012, Otago Polytechnic offered the NZQA-approved <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Another_world_first_for_Otago_Polytechnic:_OP_to_offer_full_credential_for_the_OERu" target="_blank">Graduate Diploma in Tertiary Teaching</a> through the OERu, in order, as Otago Polytechnic's Chief Executive Phil Ker put it, "to share these opportunities for learning freely with the world using open educational resources."</p>
<p>As Paul Stacey concluded on the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/tag/oeru" target="_blank">Creative Commons blog back in February</a>, "the OERu is distinctively open."</p>
<p>An additional point for the Creative Commons community in Aotearoa New Zealand is that New Zealand has the highest number of anchor partners in the world. It's great to see so many tertiary institutions in New Zealand getting behind Creative Commons licensing.</p>
<p>The good news is that this distinctively open OERu is <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Open_Educational_Resource_university_to_be_launched_worldwide" target="_blank">officially launching this week!</a> The guest of honour for the meeting will be <a href="http://www.col.org/about/staff/pages/jdaniel.aspx" target="_blank">Sir John Daniel</a>, former UNESCO Assistant Director General of Education, who will officially launch the OER university website. If you're interested, you can (virtually) attend: Just visit the <a href="http://oeruniversity.org/" target="_blank">soon-to-be-unveiled homepage</a>, and register.</p>
