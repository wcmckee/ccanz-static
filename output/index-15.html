<p>Late last year, we ran a crowd-funding campaign to pay two interns to come in and make some new resources. Over thirty people from around the world chipped in, giving us a total of $2765!</p>
<p>All that generosity didn't go unrewarded: We sent out posters, DVDs, <a title="New Creative Commons Resources" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/03/new-creative-commons-resources/" target="_blank">remix guides</a> and--by far the most popular reward--our playlist of openly licensed music. Now that all the CDs and USBs have been at their respective homes for a few months, I thought we might as well share it with everyone else.</p>
<p>As I said in my letter to the donors, the playlist is a melange of openly licensed songs from around the world, crossing many genres, styles and cultures. If you like what you hear, I recommend jumping on <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/" target="_blank">Jamendo</a>, the <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/" target="_blank">Free Music Archive</a> and the <a href="http://archive.org/index.php" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a> and checking out some of the millions of other openly songs available for free and legal download.</p>
<p>PS: scroll down to find two special bonus tracks from the winner of the Free Music Archive's <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/WFMU/blog/Revitalize_Music_Contest_The_Winning_Song" target="_blank">Revitalise Music Contest</a>. The winning band, <a href="http://crowntheinvisible.com/" target="_blank">Crown the Invisible</a>, remade the 1911 public domain song "The Spaniard That Blighted My Life" by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Merson">Billy Merson</a>.</p>

<p>Dan Untitled is the stage name of Dr Dan James, a performer, curator, Open Source Film supporter and trustee of the <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Freedom Foundation</a>. He is also the co-host of <a href="http://www.radioactive.co.nz/" target="_blank">Radio Active’s Messed Up</a>, New Zealand’s longest running mashup show, and a member of the Bootie NZ mashup crew.</p>
<p>Dan holds a PhD in Fine Arts from Massey University, specialising in Mashup performance. In 2011, he performed '<a href="http://vimeo.com/38643007" target="_blank">Breakfast Party in my Studio</a>', a live audiovisual mashup piece, to the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford. In 2012, Dan curated eleven different exhibitions for Radio Active's <a href="http://www.radioactive.fm/MoMA" target="_blank">Museum of Modern Activity</a>, including <a href="http://www.radioactive.fm/MoMAFairDeal" target="_blank"><em>Fair Deal</em></a>, <em>Interwoven</em> (a 10 year retrospective of Alyx Duncan), and <em>Having a Bit Too Much Fun</em> (music videos of Simon Ward).</p>
<p>Earlier projects include <a href="http://www.physicsroom.org.nz/events/2008/seance/">Seance for Nam June Paik</a>, 2008; Intimacy and In.yer.face, 2006; and Indeterminacy and Interface, 2005.</p>
<p>Dan first used Creative Commons licensing when he became involved with <a href="http://www.straycinema.com/" target="_blank">Stray Cinema</a>, an international open source film project, in 2006. As Dan explains “Stray Cinema operates in rounds. For each round, footage is shot in a different city, with a different director. The first round was shot in London, by Michelle Hughes. She decided to license all of her raw, unedited footage, before she’d even made a film out of it. She wanted other people making their own stories out of the same material, concurrently to her making her own film."</p>
<p>After Michelle released her raw footage on the <a href="http://www.straycinema.com/" target="_blank">Stray Cinema site</a>, participants from all over the world re-edited her work. Afterwards, Michelle’s was shown alongside the top five participant films. This also occurred for the second round, with footage shot in Barcelona. The third round took place in 2012, with a screening to be held in Melbourne, later this year.</p>
<p>In 2006, Dan also became involved with <a href="http://upstage.org.nz/blog/" target="_blank">UpStage</a>, a web platform for live online performance, eventually helping to curate online UpStage festivals from 2008 to 2010. This platform is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike</a> and, as Dan points out, “a lot of people using the platform Creative Commons license the visual and audio content of the works themselves.”</p>

<p>These days, Dan’s main involvement with Creative Commons licensing comes with his mashup projects, which he releases under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike licence</a>. As he says, “Nowadays, any music I do, I’ll licence it under Creative Commons. Some might debate about licensing mashups as CC. In my mind, though, this is in line with my argument that a mashup is a unique creation. What I’m licensing is my combination, my mix of this plus this plus this, in this particular way, with all these tweaks and changes. I don’t release all the source material that I used to create it and the licence doesn’t apply to the source material.”</p>
<p>Dan likes to use Creative Commons licences “because of the flexibility. I want to be able to say outright, feel free to use this, however you want to use it. For my non-mashup work I also like the ability to be able to set tiers of how I want something to be used or not used.”</p>
<p>In November 2012, Dan curated<a href="http://www.radioactive.fm/MoMAFairDeal" target="_blank"> an art show commissioned by the Fair Deal Coalition</a>, which included several pieces made available under a Creative Commons licence, including <a href="http://bronwyn.co.nz/projects/whisper-down-the-lane/" target="_blank">Bronwyn Holloway-Smith’s Whisper Down the Lane</a> (read <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/bronwyn-holloway-smith/" target="_blank">a case study of Bronwyn</a>). Run by InternetNZ, <a href="http://fairdeal.net.nz/" target="_blank">Fair Deal</a> is a coalition of organisations seeking to prevent any changes to New Zealand law resulting from the ongoing Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations.</p>
<p>Dan became involved with the Fair Deal Coalition because he was concerned with with how copyright law affects New Zealand artists. “I would,” Dan says, “like to see a lot more clarity about Fair Use and Fair Dealing, because that’s what impacts directly on my work. The current default when distributing work online is that you’re guilty until proven innocent... That’s not based on expert opinion, that’s based on a computer programme scanning the waveform of the visual content. As an artist, I find that really offensive.”</p>
<p>Dan points to the history of remix and reuse in music. “There’s centuries of tradition in all creative fields of artists referencing each other’s work in various ways. The only difference is the technology."</p>
<p>“It’s no different from a composer a couple of centuries ago lifting a whole section from somebody else’s composition and using it. The Baroque composer Handel is a good example - his work commonly quoted entire passages from other peoples' compositions. There are countless examples of different artists appropriating the work of others, it’s been going on for centuries - it’s well accepted in all sorts of different mediums and artforms.”</p>

I'll be talking about Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ to some of the estimated ten thousand visitors, chatting with Helen Baxter on <a href="http://makertorium.co.nz/tv/" target="_blank">Makertorium TV</a>--and briefly abandoning my post to check out the <a title="3DPrinting Petting Zoo" href="http://makertorium.co.nz/3d-petting-zoo/">3D Petting Zoo. </a></p>

<p dir="ltr">If you're in Wellington, this will be a chance to check out "creators, tinkerers and inventors from all over the country," including 3D Printers, the <a title="Anzac Periscope Challenge" href="http://makertorium.co.nz/anzac-periscope-challenge/">Anzac Periscope Challenge</a> and the <a title="Eggs Prize" href="http://makertorium.co.nz/eggs-prize/">Eggs Prize</a> launch at 2 pm.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Makertorium will run from 10 am to 6 pm, with over fifty exhibitions and installations spread over eight zones.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As the organisers put it, "From Bristlebots in Dunedin to The Diamond Age in Auckland, experience some of the best tinkering and inventing in New Zealand. Visit the 3D Petting Zoo, learn about LEDS and electronics, watch battle robots in action, test rockets in the outdoor arena and watch Makertorium TV being made live in the giant Makerbooth."</p>

<p dir="ltr">If you're around, come say hello, pick up a poster and enjoy the exhibits!</p>

<img id="logo-img-id" class="aligncenter" src="https://sites.google.com/site/nzauopenresearch/_/rsrc/1339115011176/config/customLogo.gif?revision=8" alt="Logo" width="493" height="141"><p dir="ltr">In February of this year, Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ gave its support to an exciting new initiative:<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nzauopenresearch/home"> The NZAU Open Research conference.</a> Over two days, the conference discussed the possibilities--and practicalities--of opening up Australasian research, including the use of open licensing to enable research to be shared and reused beyond the (mostly) closed academic system.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At present, the public, including non-academics with advanced degrees, cannot freely access the research they fund. While it is widely accepted that this has to change, the New Zealand and Australian research sectors have lacked a concise articulation of why Australasian researchers and research funding bodies should support OA.</p>

<p dir="ltr">With this in mind, the NZAU Open Research organising committee got together on the Friday after the conference and came up with a series of principles and recommendations for open research in New Zealand, which came to be known as the<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nzauopenresearch/tasman-declaration"> Tasman Declaration</a>. One of the Declaration's basic principles is that "research outputs should be made available with as few restrictions as possible and as soon as possible."</p>

<p dir="ltr">We fully agree. CCANZ supports the move towards open access and open licensing for publicly funded research. While,<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/what-to-make-of-the-finch-report/"> as last year's Finch Report acknowledged</a>, the move to open access will not be free, the costs of open access publishing are small next to the social, cultural and economic benefits of making publicly funded research available for all.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As the<a href="http://https//sites.google.com/site/nzauopenresearch/tasman-declaration/our-story"> NZAU Open Research team point out</a>, there are also benefits for researchers themselves: not only will their research be more widely read by the people who fund it--i.e. the public--but they will be much less likely to waste time duplicating the research of others.</p>

<p dir="ltr">And finally, let us not forget the universities themselves: NZAU Open Research cite<a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1346"> a talk from Michael Eisin</a>, which points out that, “Every year universities, governments and other organizations spend in excess of $10 billion dollars to buy back access to papers their researchers gave to journals for free.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Tasman Declaration follows recent moves towards open access and open licensing in the UK and USA. It is the latest in a series of regional declarations--including the<a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/openaccess"> Budapest Open Access Initiative</a> and the<a href="http://oa.mpg.de/berlin-prozess/berliner-erklarung/"> Berlin Declaration</a>--that argue that, as the Berlin Declaration puts it,</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;" dir="ltr">The Internet has fundamentally changed the practical and economic realities of distributing scientific knowledge and cultural heritage. For the first time ever, the Internet now offers the chance to constitute a global and interactive representation of human knowledge, including cultural heritage and the guarantee of worldwide access.</p>

<p>As some of you might have already noted, this vision is precisely <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about" target="_blank">that of Creative Commons</a>: to realise "the full potential of the Internet — universal access to research and education, full participation in culture — to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity."</p>
<p>Open access to scholarly research, including open licensing, is a significant part of this potential. You can read the story behind the Tasman Declaration <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nzauopenresearch/tasman-declaration/our-story" target="_blank">here</a>.

<a href="posts/2013/04/12/our-new-partnership-with-internetnz.html" class="u-url">Our New Partnership with InternetNZ</a>
             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2013-04-12T16:37:45+12:00">2013-04-12 16:37</time>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p></p>
<p>We're extremely excited to announce our new partnership with <a href="https://internetnz.net.nz/" target="_blank">InternetNZ</a>, an organisation that protects and promotes the Internet in New Zealand.</p>
<p>As many of you know, InternetNZ are established supporters of Creative Commons licensing. For two years now, they've hosted Creative Commons meetups at their regular <a href="http://nethui.org.nz/">Nethui conferences</a>; they also funded our popular <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeTlXtEOplA" target="_blank">Creative Commons video</a>, which has been used to explain Creative Commons licensing around the world.<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/internetnz-logo.gif"><img class="wp-image-3664 alignright" title="internetnz logo" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/internetnz-logo.gif" alt="" width="334" height="228"></a></p>
<p>InternetNZ has also made sure that copyright works that are created from InternetNZ grants  are made available under a Creative Commons Attribution or Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial licence.</p>
<p>They even use Creative Commons licensing for their own work. This includes <a href="https://internetnz.net.nz/content/copyright" target="_blank">their website</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDmzvjJ40YQ" target="_blank">this great video</a>, which I've embedded below, making the case for an open and uncapturable Internet.</p>
<p>But before we get to the video -- what does this partnership mean, exactly?</p>
<p>First, it will strengthen the ties between our two organisations, allowing us to collaborate more effectively. For a small organisation like Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ, it's important for us to strengthen such ties.</p>
<p>Second, it provides Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand with the resources to provide more regional workshops, create new resources and spread the word about open licensing. In particular, we're going to be focusing our efforts on open research and digital citizenship in New Zealand schools.</p>
<p>As Acting Chief Executive of InternetNZ <a href="https://internetnz.net.nz/news/media-releases/2013/InternetNZ-partners-Creative-Commons-Aotearoa-20000-funding-initiative" target="_blank">Jordan Carter puts it</a>, “Open licensing is becoming an increasingly important part of keeping the Internet open and uncaptureable. Creative Commons is doing great work in this area – notably in championing the freeing up of research data and promoting responsible digital citizenship through its open licensing schools initiative.”</p>
<p>You can read more about the partnership <a href="https://internetnz.net.nz/news/media-releases/2013/InternetNZ-partners-Creative-Commons-Aotearoa-20000-funding-initiative" target="_blank">over at InternetNZ</a>. Before you do so, though, check out their video, outlining why and open and uncapturable Internet is important for all New Zealanders:</p>

<h5>By Matt McGregor</h5>
<p>In 2010, Jem Yoshioka decided to enter <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_blank">Mix &amp; Mash</a>, then a new initiative from <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a> and the <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank">National Library of New Zealand</a>. Reusing Katherine Mansfield’s poem ‘<a href="http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-ManPoem-t1-body-d2-d11.html" target="_blank">An Opal Dream Cave</a>,’ Jem produced a short comic of <a href="http://jemshed.com/comic/opal-dream-cave/" target="_blank">the same name</a>.</p>
<p>With this entry, Jem won the <a href="http://www.thebigidea.co.nz/news/interviews/2011/aug/90474-jems-remixed-dreams" target="_blank">Creative Commons category of Mix &amp; Mash</a>. As Jem relates, “That was when I began to think about how I could use Creative Commons material in my work, and also start licensing my own work under Creative Commons.”</p>
<p>“I then decided to open up my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jemshed/" target="_blank">Flickr stream</a>. Now, everything I put online I licence under Creative Commons.”</p>
<p>The comics on Jem’s website, including <a href="http://jemshed.com/comic/opal-dream-cave/" target="_blank">An Opal Dream Cave</a> and <a href="http://jemshed.com/comic/sunshine/" target="_blank">Sunshine</a>, are all made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike licence</a>. Many more photos, illustrations, comics and sketches are made available under the same licence on her Flickr stream.</p>
<p>As Jem explains, “I use Creative Commons for many reasons, one of them being that I really do believe that copyright is outdated, especially given the way we can share things online. It becomes more of a burden than anything. Instead of encouraging creativity, it begins to block it.</p>
<p>“By using an open licence, it actually gives me a lot more freedom to say what I want done with my work. I don’t have to worry about people infringing on my rights, as it’s very clear what can be done with my work.”</p>
<p>Jem chose to use the Share Alike licence so “everyone that uses my work is also contributing to Creative Commons. It’s a ways of increasing the pool of work and encouraging the conversation.”</p>
<p>“The Share Alike licence is a way for me to contribute to the Creative Commons environment.”</p>
<p>Unlike some artists—like <a title="Dylan Horrocks" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/01/dylan-horrocks/" target="_blank">Dylan Horrocks</a>—Jem chose not to apply a Non-Commercial licence to her work. As she explains, “People can make money off my work. I’m really not too fussed about that, as long as it’s got my name on it, they can do whatever they like. I’d rather it be shared.</p>
<p>The ShareAlike aspect of the license means anything that is made, even commercially, also has to be ShareAlike. If a big company wants to use my work, they’re doing so while contributing to Creative Commons.”</p>
<p>“Being a part of a community also helps me to get a bit more traction for my freelance work. This model doesn’t take money away from you. It engages and connects people even more with what I do.”</p>
<p>Recently, Jem became a trustee of the <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Freedom Foundation</a>, joining other Creative Commons supporters, including Dan Untitled, <a title="Bronwyn Holloway-Smith" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/bronwyn-holloway-smith/" target="_blank">Bronwyn Holloway-Smith</a>, Matthew Holloway Smith and <a title="Luke Rowell DISASTERADIO" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/03/luke-rowell-disasteradio/" target="_blank">Luke Rowell of Disasteradio. </a></p>
<p>Jem’s next project idea is an interactive story that will use Creative Commons and Public Domain works as well as original illustrations. She will be blogging her progress <a href="http://jemshed.com/blog">over at Jemshed</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>By Matt McGregor</p>
<p><a href="http://www.waikatoindependent.co.nz/">The Waikato Independent</a> is an online newspaper produced by journalism students at the Waikato Institute of Technology. All stories published on the site are made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives 3.0 Unported Licence.</a></p>
<p>The Waikato Independent is edited by <a href="http://www.wintec.ac.nz/mediaarts/about/staff/charles-riddle.aspx">Charles Riddle, Lecturer in the School of Media Arts</a>. As Charles explains, “We use the Waikato Independent as a teaching tool. What we’re really interested in is getting our students’ work published as widely as possible.</p>
<p>“We put their work up under an open Creative Commons licence so that any of the community newspapers or websites that like the work can feel free to republish it, as long as they acknowledge the student as the author.</p>
<p>“The idea was that other media would pick it up, because the more widely a student can get published, the better it looks on their CV.”</p>
<p>Other media are paying attention. In February, <a href="http://www.waikatoindependent.co.nz/2013/02/wintec-music-student-through-to-final-x-factor-audition/10909/">this story</a> about a local talent show contestant, written by Caitlin Wallace, was picked up by <a href="http://www.hamiltonnewslive.co.nz/news/wintec-student-amy-Maynard-Hassett-x-factor/1773541/">Hamilton News Live</a>; that story, in turn, was picked up by the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10868303.">New Zealand Herald</a>, New Zealand’s largest newspaper. “It can have that knock-on effect that we’re not even always aware off.”</p>
<p>Another recent example of reuse is <a href="http://www.waikatoindependent.co.nz/2013/02/cody-cooper-wins-motocross-second-round/10889/">this story</a> about a local Motocross rider, written by Corey Rosser, which was republished in <a href="http://www.sunlive.co.nz/news/39637-papamoa-man-wins-motox-round-2.html">Sun Live</a>.</p>
<p>Faculty at Wintec’s <a href="http://www.wintec.ac.nz/mediaarts/index.aspx">School of Media Arts</a> have introduced Creative Commons licensing as part of their wider focus on media law and copyright, specifically in their third-year Web Media course.</p>
<p>Most students, Charles says, are happy to give their work an open licence. Occasionally, a photographer will want to maintain ‘All Rights Reserved’ copyright; otherwise, as Charles puts it, “we keep everything open.”</p>
<p>But what about when students graduate? Charles notes that his students may not always have a choice to use open licensing, especially if they work for more conventional news organisations. “But if they’re going to end up in Public Relations, using Creative Commons makes a lot of sense, really. We have quite a few that go into that. I would expect that they would write under Creative Commons.”</p>
<p>While noting that Creative Commons licensing is still a new concept for many, Charles points out that the licences have been a success for Wintec’s journalism students.</p>
<p>“It works fantastically for us.”</p>
