<p><a href="http://bronwyn.co.nz/" target="_blank"> Bronwyn Holloway-Smith</a> is an artist and arts advocate based in Wellington, New Zealand, interested in “internet culture, 3-dimensional printing, open source art, and space colonisation.”</p>
<p>In 2009, Bronwyn produced ‘<a href="http://bronwyn.co.nz/projects/gifts/" target="_blank">Ghosts in the Form of Gifts</a>,’ a permanent installation at Massey University, which won the 2010 Award for Open Source in the Arts.  The installation presents replicas of artefacts imagined as “lost, hidden or misregistered” from the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa.  The objects were made using an Open Source 3-dimensional printer, known as the ‘<a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap" target="_blank">RepRap</a>.’ The digital files were licensed as Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike, and were made available for download on her website.</p>
<p>Bronwyn also uploaded the files to <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/" target="_blank">Thingiverse</a>, an online repository for digital design.  Within a month, someone from Chicago’s ‘What It Is’ gallery had been in touch. Without the usual fuss of shipping and handling, the gallery had printed an object for inclusion in their 2012 show, ‘<a href="http://wot-it-is.com/2012/03/improbable-objects-032912-042812/#&amp;panel1-4" target="_blank">Improbable Objects</a>’—all without Bronwyn having to leave Wellington.</p>
<p>As she puts it, "Using Creative Commons licences has opened up new opportunities for connecting with and engaging audiences and getting my work seen around the world... Traditional copyright can be a brick-wall that discourages people from engaging.”  She points out that while New Zealand is geographically isolated, CC licences can link artists to international communities.</p>

<p>Like <a title="Luke Rowell DISASTERADIO" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/03/luke-rowell-disasteradio/" target="_blank">Luke Rowell of Disasteradio</a>, Bronwyn believes that more exciting uses of Creative Commons in the arts have yet to be discovered.  As she says, “I’m really interested in the new potential it represents.  Its potential in the arts hasn’t been fully realized.”  Bronwyn points out that Creative Commons licences are still relatively new.  She describes her projects as “experiments,” with the licences a way of “allowing others to discover new exciting uses for creative works that I can't predict.”</p>
<p>Her 2011 project '<a href="http://pioneer-city.com/" target="_blank">Pioneer City</a>,' which imagines future real estate opportunities on Mars, was recently re-imagined by the kids in Room 11 at Lyall Bay School, after reading an article on the project in local newspaper the <em>Wellingtonian</em>.</p>
<p>For the recent exhibition “<a href="http://citygallery.org.nz/exhibition/the-obstinate-object-contemporary-new-zealand-scul" target="_blank">The Obstinate Object: Contemporary New Zealand Sculpture</a>,”at Wellington’s City Gallery, Bronwyn returned to 3D printing, developing a new work titled “<a href="http://http://bronwyn.co.nz/projects/whisper-down-the-lane/" target="_blank">Whisper Down The Lane</a>”. For this piece, she collaborated with designers Ant Pelosi and Nick Graham, using Autodesk 123D Catch and Xbox Kinect programme ReconstructMe to make digital files of other works exhibited in the gallery, releasing the files for free download on Thingiverse and creating  miniature 3D prints of the works with the RepRap. For this project, she chose a BY-NC-SA licence as using a non-commercial licence “helped keep the other artists comfortable with the project.”</p>
<p>In 2008, Bronwyn co-founded the <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Freedom Foundation</a> (CFF), a non-profit organisation that represents over ten thousand New Zealand artists.  The CFF works with government officials and politicians to ensure that New Zealand artists have a voice in discussions over New Zealand’s intellectual property legislation.  As Bronwyn points out, “many New Zealand artists rely on the internet... Any changes to legislation may mean a huge deal to these artists.”</p>
<p>While using Creative Commons licences primarily allow her work to be reused and remixed, it also introduces issues of copyright and digital technology to artists and arts audiences.  “Creative Commons starts a conversation about intellectual property, which can be really useful.”  Referring to artists like Marcel Duchamp, Bronwyn explains that “Art is not an island, operating independently of what’s been made in the past.  Remix, appropriation, parody: these techniques have been used in art for centuries. We’re always building on works we’ve had access to.”</p>

<p>[Listen to Fabiana Kubke talk about open access in <a href="http://t.co/5utRhWBL" target="_blank">her Nethui interview with bFM</a>]</p>
<p>For advocates of open access, it's been a busy few months. On May 17, the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=419949&amp;c=1" target="_blank">EU released plans</a> to make  €80 billion of research from their Horizon2020 programme publicly available. On June 19, the <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/require-free-access-over-internet-scientific-journal-articles-arising-taxpayer-funded-research/wDX82FLQ?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;utm_campaign=shorturl" target="_blank">White House petition for open access</a> hit 25 000 signatures, mandating a response from President Barack Obama. On June 18, Dame Janet Finch released her team’s <a href="http://www.researchinfonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Finch-Group-report-FINAL-VERSION.pdf" target="_blank">report into open access publishing in the UK</a>, concluding that the arguments for open access to publicly funded research are “compelling... and fundamentally unanswerable.”</p>
<p>From the outside, it appears that the move to open access is inevitable. But, as Cameron Neylon says in his <a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/first-thoughts-on-the-finch-report-good-steps-but-missed-opportunities/" target="_blank">mostly positive response to Finch Report</a>, it all depends on what you mean by 'open.'</p>
<p>The Finch Report<a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/07/02/strategy-wars-open-access/" target="_blank"> has been criticised</a> for recommending the so-called ‘gold’ model, whereby researchers pay existing publishers to make their research publicly accessible. The report's authors estimate that this would cost research funders between £50-60 million pounds a year. In the competing model, known as 'green' open access, researchers deposit a version of their work in institutional repositories.</p>
<p>Against the green model, the authors of the Finch Report argue that repositories cannot act as publishers. They also argue that the existing system of green OA - whereby researchers have the choice of whether or not to deposit their research in repositories - isn't working, as only a fraction of researchers have ever participated.</p>
<p>British publishers Elsevier, of the <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/" target="_blank">Elsevier boycott</a> fame, have <a href="http://exquisitelife.researchresearch.com/exquisite_life/2012/06/elsevier-welcomes-the-finch-report.html" target="_blank">welcomed the report</a>, joining several <a href="http://www.stm-assoc.org/industry-news/stm-welcomes-report-of-the-finch-group-into-expanding-access-to-research-publications-in-the-uk/" target="_blank">publishers'</a> <a href="http://www.alpsp.org/Ebusiness/AboutALPSP/ALPSPStatements/Statementdetails.aspx?ID=409" target="_blank">associations</a>. For the report's critics, this is hardly surprising: gold open access promises to maintain the large profit margins enjoyed by the major scholarly publishing companies, which are often well over 30%. For Elsevier, this equated to profits of <a href="posts/2012/07/11/svpow.com/2012/01/13/the-obscene-profits-of-commercial-scholarly-publishers/">£768 million in 2011</a>.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, a degree of open access already exists. The <a href="http://nzresearch.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZResearch database</a>, hosted by the National Library, links to thousands of papers and dissertations available in New Zealand's institutional repositories. <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic/Intellectual_property" target="_blank">Otago Polytechnic</a> has also given its support to free and open access to research.</p>
<p>But it remains the case that most publicly funded research in New Zealand is not publicly available. While the movement for open access is clearly gaining steam, it's still not clear what kind of 'open' future New Zealand researchers will enjoy.</p>
<p>We'll be talking about all this and much more in Thursday night's <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/event/nethui/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Meetup.</a> What are your thoughts? What's the way forward for the New Zealand open access movement? Join the discussion below, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/contact/" target="_blank">send us an email</a> or tweet your comments, and we'll bring it up on the night.</p>
<p>[Update: The Guardian<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/15/free-access-british-scientific-research" target="_blank"> reports</a> that the British government plans to implement the recommendations of the Finch report, including the Gold open access model, by 2014]</p>

<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is happy to be able to take the covers off its new website. As you'll see:</p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>we've retained some of the previous branding (because we like it);<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>we've restructured the homepage to have an upfront focus on what Creative Commons is all about, followed immediately by what matters most (getting your hands on the licences and learning how to use them) and then flowing into our and the community's latest news and events;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>you can subscribe to site updates by email or RSS (both if you're really keen); and<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>you can still subscribe to the traditional community mailing list for email-based discussion with community members.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre>




<p>You'll also notice that we've removed the "Creative Commoners" and "Forum" areas that appeared on the old site as these weren't used much in practice. We propose to focus on alternative means of getting the community involved and will be telling you more about that soon.</p>
<p>In terms of what's under the hood, the new site is running on the latest version of WordPress sitting on a virtual private server here in New Zealand. As for plugins, we've kept them to a minimum but are using <a title="Gravity Forms" href="http://www.gravityforms.com/" target="_blank">Gravity Forms</a> for forms, <a title="The Events Calendar" href="http://tri.be/wordpress-events-calendar/" target="_blank">The Events Calendar</a> for events and <a title="BackupBuddy" href="http://pluginbuddy.com/purchase/backupbuddy/" target="_blank">BackupBuddy</a> for, well, backups. Using WordPress, itself a truly open content management system, makes it easier to manage the site and will enable us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>evolve the site over time to meet the needs of the community with a minimum of hassle and cost; and</li>

    <li>enjoy all the other open source goodness surrounding WordPress.</li>

</ul>
<p>We hope you find the site useful.</p>
<p>Oh, and one other thing. We know there are a few loose ends to tidy up in, for example, some of the older post content. We also need to add a few of the more recent posts from the old site to this new one. We'll be working on these things in the coming weeks. The <acronym title="Domain Name System">DNS</acronym>-conscious among you may also notice that the new site is here at <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz">http://creativecommons.org.nz</a>, whereas <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz">http://creativecommons.org.nz</a> will take you to the old site. The final DNS-changes will be made on Monday 9 July and that will result in both URLs taking you to the new site. All good.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards. Keep sharing.</p>

<p>On May 23, the Academic Senate of University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) voted to make all current and future research publicly available. The move follows years of public debate about the rising cost of academic journals and the responsibility of researchers to free up publicly funded research.</p>
<p>UCSF currently receives US$532.8 million from the National Institute of Health, which makes it the largest recipient in the country. This equates to more than 4,500 scientific pages each year.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k77982&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup143448" target="_blank">memorandum on journal pricing</a>, published by the Faculty Advisory Council of Harvard University, pointed out that journal prices had increased 145% over the last six years, far outstripping both the Consumer Price Index and the Higher Education Price Index. The move by UCSF resembles similar moves at Harvard and MIT, and follows an unsuccessful push for open access across the University of California system in 2006.</p>

<strong>THURSDAY 12 July 2012, 6pm-7pm at </strong><a href="http://nethui.org.nz/events" target="_self"><strong>NetHui 2012</strong></a><strong>, SkyCity Convention Centre</strong>
<p>The drive for ‘open’ in tertiary education—be it ‘open education,’ ‘open research’ or ‘open access’—is quickly gaining steam. In May, the academic senate of the University of California San Francisco joined Harvard and MIT to announce that all current and future research would be made available to the public. In December 2011, the British government made a commitment to provide open access to publicly funded data.</p>
<p>At the same time, academics are experiencing tensions between the drive to make publicly funded research openly available and the need to publish in ‘prestige’ journals. International movements such as Open Educational Resources (OER) are helping to guide teachers and researchers through these murky waters.  These movements are also working to lower the cost of producing educational resources, in order to supply them online to educators, for free.</p>
<p>How can twenty-first century researchers and tertiary education providers navigate their rights and responsibilities in regards to their work? How do we help realise ‘Open Research’ and its relationship to ‘Open Government’? What are our expectations for ‘Open Education’?</p>
<p>Join us for an evening of information and discussion on the Open Research and OER Movements in tertiary education.</p>
<p>Speakers will include:</p>
<p>-          Dr Fabiana Kubke, Senior Lecturer, School of Medical Sciences, University of Auckland</p>
<p>-          Professor Anne Fitzgerald, Queensland University of Technology Law Faculty and Creative Commons Australia</p>
<p>-          Dr Wayne Mackintosh, Director Open Education Resource Foundation and Commonwealth of Learning Chair in OER, Otago Polytechnic</p>

<p>UNESCO Asia and the Pacific Regional Bureau for Education, Commonwealth of Learning and Thai Teachers TV recently held a <a href="http://oercongress.weebly.com/asia-pacific.html" target="_self">policy forum on Open Educational Resources</a> (OER). Creative Commons projects from this region <a href="http://wikieducator.org/CC_Asia_Pacific_OER" target="_self">showcased success</a> in the OER movement. Regional meetings lead up to the World OER Congress and the formation of a <a href="http://oercongress.weebly.com/paris-declaration.html" target="_self">Declaration</a> for governments to sign. The Congress will bring together Ministers of Education/Human Resource Development, senior policy makers, expert practitioners, researchers and relevant stakeholders to discuss what works and what won’t work, and to agree on a Declaration with a set of targets for a 2015 World Conference.</p>

<h3>OER In New Zealand</h3>
<p>The New Zealand Government has its own <a title="http://nzgoal.info" href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework</a> which provides guidance for agencies releasing data and content for reuse. The framework recommends CC BY as the default licence for this.</p>
<p>CC New Zealand collaborates with the Ministry of Education to provide professional development for teachers around New Zealand on Creative Commons and OER. We encourage and support schools to follow in the path of <a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School" target="_self">Albany Senior High School</a>, who have a CC intellectual property policy at their school, and utilize open source software.</p>
<p>The <a title="OERF" href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF" target="_self">Open Education Resource Foundation</a> has its base in Otago. <a title="Otago Polytechnic/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic/Home" target="_self">Otago Polytechnic</a> was the first institution in the world to adopt default CC-BY intellectual property policy, and five Kiwi institutions are founding anchor partners of the <a title="OER university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" target="_self">OERu initiative</a>.</p>
<h3>OER in Australia</h3>

<p>The University of Southern Queensland (USQ) is a strong provider of distance education programs, with 75% of its students studying by distance education. <a title="http://ocw.usq.edu.au" href="http://ocw.usq.edu.au/" target="_self">USQ’s OpenCourseWare (OCW)</a> portal makes 10 courses available under a CC BY-NC-SA license.</p>
<p>‘<a title="http://www.teaching-learning.utas.edu.au/designing/open-educational-resources/open-education-resources" href="http://www.teaching-learning.utas.edu.au/designing/open-educational-resources/open-education-resources" target="_self">Bridging the Gap: teaching adaptations across the disciplines and sharing content for curriculum renewal</a>' commenced in January 2012. It is led by the University of Tasmania and funded by the</p>
<p>Australian Learning and Teaching Council Ltd (ALTC) – now Office of Learning and Teaching (OLT)).</p>
<h3>OER in South Korea</h3>

<p><a title="http://www.snow.or.kr" href="http://www.snow.or.kr/" target="_self">SNOW</a> “Sookmyung Network for Open World” is a community type OER platform that delivers remarkable courseware around the world to a Korean speaking audience. Users can upload OER content to share, discuss with comments, and translate into Korean</p>
<p><a title="http://ocw.korea.edu" href="http://ocw.korea.edu/" target="_self">Korea University’s OCW</a> is the official Open CourseWare site for Korea University and makes course materials available through CC licensing. It holds more than 270 classes, provided by professors who believe in sharing and opening up their resources.</p>
<p>Since 2009, the <a title="http://ocw.ulsan.ac.kr" href="http://ocw.ulsan.ac.kr/" target="_self">University of Ulsan has run its OCW website</a> for students and general users. It shares more than 500 classes by over 24 professors throughout 11 colleges.</p>
<p><a title="http://egoing.net/" href="http://egoing.net/" target="_self">Egoing</a> is a independent blogger who is voluntarily uploading online tutorials. His project has been described as the “Korean IT version of Khan Academy.” His most well-known curriculum “Life Coding” encourages people to become familiar with IT and learn how to code by themselves. This program offers video tutorials, a discussion board, Facebook group, and a mutually shared study schedule. It is an example of how a non-organization initiated open education program can be successful through a self-motivated and dedicated program developer and networking participants.</p>

<p>The New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) has launched a competition for Year 9 - 13 secondary students and NZ schools to use creative remix or data mashup as a way to explore the theme of road safety.</p>
<p><a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/competitions/the-nzta-remix-competition-safer-journeys-for-teens" target="_self">The NZTA Remix Competition</a> has two parts. The first is to create an infographic, mashup, creative remix, or a literature remix (based on the works of Shakespeare) using content and data from NZTA websites and publications. The second part is to present or engage with students at your school with the entry you have made, and provide evidence of having undertaken this.</p>
<p>Entries will open on September 1st 2012 and close on October 31st 2012.</p>
<p>It's important to think about copyright when remixing the work of others. Students and teachers need to be sure that a creator is happy for their work to be used, and if so, they need to think about the conditions under which they may be allowed to use it.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/competitions/the-nzta-remix-competition-safer-journeys-for-teens" target="_self">terms and conditions</a> of the competition ask you to respect the copyright of others. <em>"All content other than NZTA assets must be produced by the students themselves (by creating original audio, video or images) or by using remixable assets that are, in the public domain, openly licensed or with written permission of the originator."</em></p>
<p>Videos, images and music licensed under Creative Commons (or rather, Creative Commons materials that do not prohibit derivative works) are 'openly licensed' resources and are perfect for remix. The creators have already given permission for their works to be reused, as long as entrants follow the terms of their CC licence.</p>
<p>Schools entering will need to make sure they <strong>attribute</strong>, or give credit, to each work they use in their remix - as required by each of the CC licences. Here are some <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking/Users" target="_self">useful tips</a> for how to attribute well.</p>
<p>See our <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences_explained__1" target="_self">Licences Explained</a> to find out more about the others terms a CC licence might set out for you.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Where to find content?</h4>
<p>The competition's <a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/competitions/the-nzta-remix-competition-safer-journeys-for-teens" target="_self">Remixable Resources</a> page sets out some useful places to find suitable CC licensed materials. Remember that you can also find some great images that are in the public domain (without copyright). Try <a href="http://www.flickr.com/commons/" target="_self">The Commons</a> collection on Flickr for old pictures from around the world. A <a href="http://digitalnz.org/records?i%5Bformat%5D=Images&amp;i%5Brights%5D=Modify&amp;text=car" target="_self">DigitalNZ search</a> will also help you find NZ public domain and CC materials. Need sound effects? Go to <a href="http://www.freesound.org/browse/tags/car/" target="_self">FreeSound</a> for CC licensed tracks like <a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/cognito%20perceptu/sounds/17924/" target="_self">urban traffic noises</a> and <a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/guitarguy1985/sounds/54086/" target="_self">car horns</a>.</p>

<p>Teachers, technologists and institutions around the world are celebrating open educational resources (OERs) for <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_self">Open Education Week</a>.</p>
<p>OERs are learning materials that can be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" target="_self">freely shared and reused by anyone</a>. Creative Commons licences, when applied to teaching materials, help creators release their work for the public to enjoy and benefit from. Those same creators can also pick up someone else's Creative Commons licensed work to make their own outputs richer, more colorful or better informed.</p>
<p>The ability to bring in and and adapt high quality materials for new learning resources is vital in our digital information age. Finding pictures and videos to post on teaching blogs, reproducing chapters and articles, the ability to translate information into any language - each of these freedoms people want to enjoy legally are enabled by the OER movement.</p>
<p><strong>Open Access Week runs from March 5th - 10th</strong> and is designed to inform people about OERs and promote their value to a global learning environment. There will be webinars open to participation from anyone, virtual tours, pre-recorded presentations, documents and discussion opportunities.</p>
<p>Keep an eye of the <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_self">Open Education Week website</a> for information about upcoming events.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cckorea.org/xe/?mid=english" target="_self">Creative Commons Korea</a> project has released an attractive new content search tool - making it easy to source Creative Commons licensed materials.</p>
<p>The "<a href="http://eng.letscc.net/" target="_self">Let's CC</a>" website brings you relevant results from pools such as Flickr, Foopedia, Clipart, Freesound, Slideshare and more. Simply type in a search term and filter for how many freedoms the copyright owner has granted you with their Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>"Let's CC" was originally created for a Korean audience, so we're thrilled that Kiwi's can enjoy it in its English language version. Other CC content searches can be made through global CC's own <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/" target="_self">search interface</a> and through <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_self">DigitalNZ</a> for New Zealand results.</p>
