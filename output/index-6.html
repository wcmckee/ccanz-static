<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/wellington-city-council/wellington-screen-shot-long/" rel="attachment wp-att-1659"><img class="wp-image-1659" title="Wellington screen shot long" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Wellington-screen-shot-long.png" alt="" width="621" height="287"></a> A section of Wellington city from the air, via <a href="http://koordinates.com/#/maps/wcc/">Koordinates</a>. Made available by the Wellington City Council under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence.</a>
<p style="text-align:left;">In April 2010, Wellington City Council started <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/wcc/" target="_blank">to release spatial data on Koordinates</a>, a platform for hosting and viewing geospatial datasets.</p>

<p>The council’s spatial data – which includes aerial photography, contours, parks, pipes, windzones and walkways – had always been available for Wellington residents. Before 2010, however, users had to send a request to the council; they also had to pay a processing fee.</p>
<p>The purpose of the fee, as Senior Spatial Functional Analyst Andrew Shakes puts it, was to recover some of the money spent gathering the data. “In reality,” Andrew says, “council staff had to manually extract data for each request and the user fees often did not cover the council’s processing costs."</p>
<p>More importantly, the fees and processing time appear to have dissuaded many ratepayers from making use of council data. Andrew estimates that “when we were responding to ad hoc requests, we’d probably process several a week.”</p>
<p>Since the release of the council’s spatial data, use has risen dramatically: In the last two years, the council’s <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/wcc/#/layer/1479-wellington-city-1m-contours-2009/" target="_blank">1m Contours</a> layer has been downloaded 3000 times; the <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/wcc/#/layer/1474-wellington-city-building-footprints/" target="_blank">Building Footprints</a> layer, which represents rooftop outlines in Wellington city, has been downloaded 3500 times.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the popularity of the spatial data is the ease with which it can be viewed and downloaded. Anyone can visit the Koordinates platform and see the data displayed on a map of Wellington city. As CEO and co-founder of Koordinates Ed Corkery <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/10/koordinates-the-one-place-for-geodata/" target="_blank">explains</a>, “When you add a map layer, the actual data is converted into a simple Google Maps view and displayed in your web browser.”</p>
<p>A user could, for example, choose to overlay contour lines and potential flooding areas onto a Google map of Wellington City—and then download it, for free, to use in their own CAD or GIS software.</p>
<p>This is saving the council a great deal of time. As Andrew puts it, “Rather than people asking us for monthly data updates that we have to extract manually, and charge them for, we can set something up that does it automatically.”</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/wellington-city-council/wellington-city-building-footprints/" rel="attachment wp-att-1665"><img class="wp-image-1665  " title="Wellington City Building Footprints" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Wellington-City-Building-Footprints.png" alt="" width="361" height="361"></a> Building Footprints in Wellington city, via <a href="http://koordinates.com/#/maps/wcc/">Koordinates</a>. Made available by the Wellington City Council under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence.</a></p>
<p>Koordinates also hosts datasets from public agencies like <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/linz/" target="_blank">LINZ</a>, <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/statsnz/" target="_blank">Statistics New Zealand</a> and <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/porirua-city-council/" target="_blank">Porirua City Co</a><a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/porirua-city-council/" target="_blank">uncil</a>. One of the sites most popular layers, <a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/3185-christchurch-post-earthquake-aerial-photos-24-feb-2011/" target="_blank">aerial photos of Christchurch after the 2010 earthquake</a>, has been viewed over 77 000 times.</p>
<p>The council has chosen to give the data a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>, the most open Creative Commons licence. “We’ve got to focus on what’s best for our ratepayers,” Andrew explains. “If a ratepayer wants an aerial photo, why not make it freely available to them? They’re paying for it through their rates anyway. Also, we want the economy to grow, we want businesses to be able to use the data. This process allows 24/7 access and saves money as there is less need for manual processing by Council staff.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geospatial.govt.nz/productivityreport/" target="_blank">A 2009 report</a> commissioned by Land Information New Zealand and the Ministry for the Environment concluded that the New Zealand economy would receive a boost of at least $481 million from the release of spatial data. Since then, Cabinet has approved <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_blank">New Zealand Government Open Access Licensing framework</a>, known as NZGOAL, in August 2010. The framework encourages government agencies to release their data under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>Although the release of the council’s spatial data has been extremely popular, not all council data can be released under Creative Commons. As Andrew explains, sometimes the copyright to council data is held by other organisations. The council also has to think about privacy and liability. Andrew’s team ensures that its data is kept up to date. “We don’t just put the data out there... you’ve got to think about how the data is going to be maintained.”</p>
<p>In releasing its data under a Creative Commons licence, Wellington City Council joins many other public agencies, including Statistics New Zealand, LINZ, the Ministry for the Environment, Wellington Regional Council and, most recently, the New Zealand Transport Agency.</p>
<p>As Mayor Celia Wade-Brown <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK1102/S00713/geospatial-goldmine-ready-for-public-use.htm" target="_blank">put it in 2011</a>, the council's spatial data is “a goldmine of information.”</p>
<p>“Whether it’s a Government organisation, community group, businesses or individuals using it – this information aids decision-making and it will allow many projects or initiatives to be completed more quickly, cheaply and effectively.”</p>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/warrington-school/orokonui_valley/" rel="attachment wp-att-1636"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1636 " title="Orokonui_valley" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Orokonui_valley-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a> Orokonui Valley, overlooking Blueskin Bay in Otago. Released into the public domain by its author, Nankai, via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orokonui_valley.jpg">Wikieducator</a>
<p><a href="http://wikieducator.org/Warrington_School" target="_blank">Warrington School</a> is a small primary school in Otago’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueskin_Bay" target="_blank">Blueskin Bay</a>. With five teachers and around fifty students, Warrington has embraced both open source software and Creative Commons licences.</p>
<p>Warrington’s principal, Nathan Parker, came to Creative Commons licences through open software like Ubuntu, Linux and Open Office. Wayne Mackintosh, of the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resources Foundation</a>, noticed what Warrington was doing, and invited Nathan to start sharing teaching resources on <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikieducator</a>.</p>
<p>Hosted by Otago Polytechnic, Wikieducator is a platform for teachers across the world to share, remix and reuse educational materials. Dozens of schools around New Zealand are using the wiki through <a href="http://wikieducator.org/New_Zealand_Schools_OER_Portal" target="_blank">New Zealand’s Open Educational Resources portal</a>.</p>
<p>However, as Nathan quickly discovered, the school's Board of Trustees held the copyright to all  resources produced by Warrington's teachers. "We soon realized," Nathan says, "that we can’t put our resources on the wiki, because we as teachers don’t own it." By sharing their teaching resources on Wikieducator, the teachers of Warrington School were breaking the law.</p>
<p>In order to prevent copyright violation, the school “needed to formalise the change through a creative commons policy.” As was the case with <a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/" target="_blank">Albany Senior High School</a>, Nathan found that his Board of Trustees was “very happy” to give advance permission for teachers to share their resources. The board saw that “being able to share ideas and allowing other teachers to improve or add to our teaching resources was a smart move for education.”</p>

<p>Other smart moves include the use of open source software. Instead of using proprietary software packages, provided for a fee by large for-profit companies like Microsoft and Apple, Warrington makes use of free, open source alternatives. As a result, Warrington is one of the few New Zealand schools not to pay copyright fees.</p>
<p>Nathan hopes that more schools decide to work with openly licensed software and teaching resources. He points to Portugal and <a href="http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/iceland-open-source-public-secto-68719" target="_blank">Iceland</a> as examples of countries using open source software across their education systems, saving their governments millions of dollars in licensing agreements</p>
<p>Warrington also encourages its students to use Creative Commons licensed material in their projects. Two of Nathan's students are planning to enter <a href="http://www.theoutlookforsomeday.net/" target="_blank">Outlook for Someday</a>, a sustainability themed documentary competition. Nathan pointed them to <a href="http://vimeo.com/tag:creativecommons" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>, where the students came across documentaries with Creative Commons licences. “The students could use the footage in their own film, and give it their own interpretation," Nathan says. “It’s just great.”</p>
<p>Warrington School also runs its own radio station, <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Blueskin_Bay_FM" target="_blank">Blueskin Bay FM</a>. The station hosts student and community programmes, and plays music with Creative Commons licenses. As Nathan explains, "If we play copyright music, we have to pay licensing fees. Using Creative Commons music, we don’t need to ask permission, and we don’t need to pay, and the radio station just ticks along.”</p>
<p>After moving to open source software and Creative Commons licensing, Warrington has found a greater awareness of copyright and open licensing in the students, the teachers, and even the wider community.</p>
<p>“When I look outside at other schools, I think, why aren’t you doing this?”</p>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/understand-and-teach-creative-commons/creativecommonskiwi/" rel="attachment wp-att-1590"><img class="wp-image-1590 aligncenter" title="creativecommonskiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/creativecommonskiwi-300x278.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="189"></a>In my experience, many teachers--and most students--would rather not think about copyright. In this respect, they resemble just about every other person on the planet. Copyright is an undeniably thorny topic, full of arcane details and legal minutiae: most of us would, understandably, rather not spend our time studying the fine print of the <a href="http://www.copyright.org.nz/legislation.php" target="_blank">Copyright Act. </a>
<p>But copyright is not something teachers can easily avoid. Most of the educational resources used by teachers are locked under copyright; the copyright to all the resources teachers produce is held by their respective Board of Trustees. At the same time, sharing, remix and reuse is fundamental to teaching. After all, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb0syrgsH6M" target="_blank">without sharing, there is no education</a>."</p>
<p>Digital technologies promise to make sharing educational resources much easier. In theory, the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) promised with the <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/EducationInitiatives/UFBInSchools/ANetworkForLearning.aspx" target="_blank">Network for Learning</a> (N4L) could enable every school in New Zealand to work together, a truly exciting possibility. Under existing copyright legislation, however, teachers are not allowed to remix, adapt and share copyright materials across the N4L.</p>
<p>This is where Creative Commons can help. Creative Commons provides the tools that enable sharing to occur. Our licences are legally robust and--unlike most copyright legislation--human-readable.</p>
<p>Using Creative Commons licences, teachers can make and share open education resources across the N4L. Teachers can also use Creative Commons licences to teach their students about copyright, attribution and referencing--an increasingly essential part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>But if learning about copyright is difficult, teaching it can be even harder. To this end, we've put together some resources for Creative Commons champions across the country. We want you to help us spread the word about Creative Commons.</p>
<ul>
<li>The National Library has put out this <a href="http://schools.natlib.govt.nz/sites/schools.natlib.govt.nz/files/services-to-schools-poster-creative-commons-in-classroom.pdf" target="_blank">rather brilliant poster</a>.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>We've put together this <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank">template slide show</a>, for everyone to share, remix and reuse. Use it in your classes, conferences and professional development days. Email us at admin@creativecommons.org.nz if you want the script. Let us know if you make a better version, and we'll put it on our website.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The latest issue of <a href="http://interfaceonline.co.nz/" target="_blank">Interface Magazine</a> has an A3 pull-out poster for students and teachers. A version of the poster is <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Creative-Commons-for-Schools-poster.pdf" target="_blank">here,</a> though you'll need to get the magazine for the glossy original!</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Creative Commons champion Helen Baxter, who runs Mohawk Media, has written <a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/remix-columns" target="_blank">a series of columns</a> on how to use and reuse Creative Commons resources for the NZTA Remix competition.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The National Library (again!) have made a guide to remixing materials, <a href="http://schools.natlib.govt.nz/21st-century-literacy-inquiry/sources-resources/guide-reusing-digital-content" target="_blank">Free To Mix</a>. This is an excellent home-grown guide. As a living document, it is continually updated.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>We have a box of brochures sitting in our office. Email  us if you want some to share with your classroom, conference, library or colleagues.</li>

<li>Creative Commons Australia have these <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/learn-more/fact-sheets" target="_blank">slideshows and factsheets</a> for educators.</li>

             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2012-07-23T09:54:37+12:00">2012-07-23 09:54</time>

<p>In 2012, Auckland’s <a href="http://www.ashs.school.nz/" target="_blank">Albany Senior High School </a>adopted a Creative Commons policy, and thus became New Zealand’s first fully open-source school. The policy ensures that all teaching materials and policies produced at ASHS are given a default Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence.</p>
<p>Currently, the copyright to all teaching materials produced by New Zealand teachers is held by their respective schools’ Boards of Trustees. As Albany Senior High School Deputy Principal Mark Osborne points out, “Sharing resources is something teachers have done since teaching started... and most people don’t realise they’re breaking the law by doing that.”<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/200px-ashs_logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-1511"><img class="size-full wp-image-1511 alignright" title="200px-ASHS_logo" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/200px-ASHS_logo.png" alt="" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
<p>Albany Senior High School’s Creative Commons policy allows—and even encourages—teachers to, as Mark puts it, “share the family silver.” Many of ASHS’s teachers work on WikiEducator, an initiative of the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resource Foundation</a>, hosted at New Zealand’s <a href="http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/" target="_blank">Otago Polytechnic</a>. ASHS contributed to WikiEducator, Mark says, “because we want to be open and collaborative.”</p>
<p><a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank">Their Creative Commons policy</a> ensures that teachers “felt free to contribute to Open Educational Resources projects without having written permission from our Board of Trustees.” The Board itself saw the advantages of students and teachers joining the growing international OER community.</p>
<p>As ASHS Deputy Principal Mark Osborne puts it, “When we were putting our vision for the school together, and our vision for our students, we knew that there were real opportunities. We wanted collaboration, sharing and community.” Along with their use of Creative Commons licences, ASHS have stocked their computers with open-source software, saving the school thousands of dollars in licensing fees.</p>
<p>Other schools are following suit.<a href="http://wikieducator.org/Warrington_School" target="_blank"> Warrington Primary School</a> has adopted an intellectual property policy, and has embraced open source software. Mark Osborne hopes that other schools have a look at the resources available online, and begin a conversation with their Boards of Trustees about formulating their own Creative Commons policies.</p>
<p>As more schools participate, the OER movement will enjoy what Mark calls a “network effect” – the exponential benefit of having thousands of kiwi teachers building and sharing Creative Commons-licensed resources.</p>
<p>Four years on, the effect on traditional teaching methods at Albany Senior High School has been dramatic.  “The big change taking place” Mark says, “is that teachers are collaborating more, and they’re also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources. This is quite different from what happens in most schools.”</p>

<p><a href="http://bronwyn.co.nz/" target="_blank"> Bronwyn Holloway-Smith</a> is an artist and arts advocate based in Wellington, New Zealand, interested in “internet culture, 3-dimensional printing, open source art, and space colonisation.”</p>
<p>In 2009, Bronwyn produced ‘<a href="http://bronwyn.co.nz/projects/gifts/" target="_blank">Ghosts in the Form of Gifts</a>,’ a permanent installation at Massey University, which won the 2010 Award for Open Source in the Arts.  The installation presents replicas of artefacts imagined as “lost, hidden or misregistered” from the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa.  The objects were made using an Open Source 3-dimensional printer, known as the ‘<a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap" target="_blank">RepRap</a>.’ The digital files were licensed as Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike, and were made available for download on her website.</p>
<p>Bronwyn also uploaded the files to <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/" target="_blank">Thingiverse</a>, an online repository for digital design.  Within a month, someone from Chicago’s ‘What It Is’ gallery had been in touch. Without the usual fuss of shipping and handling, the gallery had printed an object for inclusion in their 2012 show, ‘<a href="http://wot-it-is.com/2012/03/improbable-objects-032912-042812/#&amp;panel1-4" target="_blank">Improbable Objects</a>’—all without Bronwyn having to leave Wellington.</p>
<p>As she puts it, "Using Creative Commons licences has opened up new opportunities for connecting with and engaging audiences and getting my work seen around the world... Traditional copyright can be a brick-wall that discourages people from engaging.”  She points out that while New Zealand is geographically isolated, CC licences can link artists to international communities.</p>

<p>Like <a title="Luke Rowell DISASTERADIO" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/03/luke-rowell-disasteradio/" target="_blank">Luke Rowell of Disasteradio</a>, Bronwyn believes that more exciting uses of Creative Commons in the arts have yet to be discovered.  As she says, “I’m really interested in the new potential it represents.  Its potential in the arts hasn’t been fully realized.”  Bronwyn points out that Creative Commons licences are still relatively new.  She describes her projects as “experiments,” with the licences a way of “allowing others to discover new exciting uses for creative works that I can't predict.”</p>
<p>Her 2011 project '<a href="http://pioneer-city.com/" target="_blank">Pioneer City</a>,' which imagines future real estate opportunities on Mars, was recently re-imagined by the kids in Room 11 at Lyall Bay School, after reading an article on the project in local newspaper the <em>Wellingtonian</em>.</p>
<p>For the recent exhibition “<a href="http://citygallery.org.nz/exhibition/the-obstinate-object-contemporary-new-zealand-scul" target="_blank">The Obstinate Object: Contemporary New Zealand Sculpture</a>,”at Wellington’s City Gallery, Bronwyn returned to 3D printing, developing a new work titled “<a href="http://http://bronwyn.co.nz/projects/whisper-down-the-lane/" target="_blank">Whisper Down The Lane</a>”. For this piece, she collaborated with designers Ant Pelosi and Nick Graham, using Autodesk 123D Catch and Xbox Kinect programme ReconstructMe to make digital files of other works exhibited in the gallery, releasing the files for free download on Thingiverse and creating  miniature 3D prints of the works with the RepRap. For this project, she chose a BY-NC-SA licence as using a non-commercial licence “helped keep the other artists comfortable with the project.”</p>
<p>In 2008, Bronwyn co-founded the <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Freedom Foundation</a> (CFF), a non-profit organisation that represents over ten thousand New Zealand artists.  The CFF works with government officials and politicians to ensure that New Zealand artists have a voice in discussions over New Zealand’s intellectual property legislation.  As Bronwyn points out, “many New Zealand artists rely on the internet... Any changes to legislation may mean a huge deal to these artists.”</p>
<p>While using Creative Commons licences primarily allow her work to be reused and remixed, it also introduces issues of copyright and digital technology to artists and arts audiences.  “Creative Commons starts a conversation about intellectual property, which can be really useful.”  Referring to artists like Marcel Duchamp, Bronwyn explains that “Art is not an island, operating independently of what’s been made in the past.  Remix, appropriation, parody: these techniques have been used in art for centuries. We’re always building on works we’ve had access to.”</p>

<p>[Listen to Fabiana Kubke talk about open access in <a href="http://t.co/5utRhWBL" target="_blank">her Nethui interview with bFM</a>]</p>
<p>For advocates of open access, it's been a busy few months. On May 17, the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=419949&amp;c=1" target="_blank">EU released plans</a> to make  €80 billion of research from their Horizon2020 programme publicly available. On June 19, the <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/require-free-access-over-internet-scientific-journal-articles-arising-taxpayer-funded-research/wDX82FLQ?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;utm_campaign=shorturl" target="_blank">White House petition for open access</a> hit 25 000 signatures, mandating a response from President Barack Obama. On June 18, Dame Janet Finch released her team’s <a href="http://www.researchinfonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Finch-Group-report-FINAL-VERSION.pdf" target="_blank">report into open access publishing in the UK</a>, concluding that the arguments for open access to publicly funded research are “compelling... and fundamentally unanswerable.”</p>
<p>From the outside, it appears that the move to open access is inevitable. But, as Cameron Neylon says in his <a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/first-thoughts-on-the-finch-report-good-steps-but-missed-opportunities/" target="_blank">mostly positive response to Finch Report</a>, it all depends on what you mean by 'open.'</p>
<p>The Finch Report<a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/07/02/strategy-wars-open-access/" target="_blank"> has been criticised</a> for recommending the so-called ‘gold’ model, whereby researchers pay existing publishers to make their research publicly accessible. The report's authors estimate that this would cost research funders between £50-60 million pounds a year. In the competing model, known as 'green' open access, researchers deposit a version of their work in institutional repositories.</p>
<p>Against the green model, the authors of the Finch Report argue that repositories cannot act as publishers. They also argue that the existing system of green OA - whereby researchers have the choice of whether or not to deposit their research in repositories - isn't working, as only a fraction of researchers have ever participated.</p>
<p>British publishers Elsevier, of the <a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/" target="_blank">Elsevier boycott</a> fame, have <a href="http://exquisitelife.researchresearch.com/exquisite_life/2012/06/elsevier-welcomes-the-finch-report.html" target="_blank">welcomed the report</a>, joining several <a href="http://www.stm-assoc.org/industry-news/stm-welcomes-report-of-the-finch-group-into-expanding-access-to-research-publications-in-the-uk/" target="_blank">publishers'</a> <a href="http://www.alpsp.org/Ebusiness/AboutALPSP/ALPSPStatements/Statementdetails.aspx?ID=409" target="_blank">associations</a>. For the report's critics, this is hardly surprising: gold open access promises to maintain the large profit margins enjoyed by the major scholarly publishing companies, which are often well over 30%. For Elsevier, this equated to profits of <a href="posts/2012/07/11/svpow.com/2012/01/13/the-obscene-profits-of-commercial-scholarly-publishers/">£768 million in 2011</a>.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, a degree of open access already exists. The <a href="http://nzresearch.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZResearch database</a>, hosted by the National Library, links to thousands of papers and dissertations available in New Zealand's institutional repositories. <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic/Intellectual_property" target="_blank">Otago Polytechnic</a> has also given its support to free and open access to research.</p>
<p>But it remains the case that most publicly funded research in New Zealand is not publicly available. While the movement for open access is clearly gaining steam, it's still not clear what kind of 'open' future New Zealand researchers will enjoy.</p>
<p>We'll be talking about all this and much more in Thursday night's <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/event/nethui/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Meetup.</a> What are your thoughts? What's the way forward for the New Zealand open access movement? Join the discussion below, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/contact/" target="_blank">send us an email</a> or tweet your comments, and we'll bring it up on the night.</p>
<p>[Update: The Guardian<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/15/free-access-british-scientific-research" target="_blank"> reports</a> that the British government plans to implement the recommendations of the Finch report, including the Gold open access model, by 2014]</p>

<p></p>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is happy to be able to take the covers off its new website. As you'll see:</p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>we've retained some of the previous branding (because we like it);<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>we've restructured the homepage to have an upfront focus on what Creative Commons is all about, followed immediately by what matters most (getting your hands on the licences and learning how to use them) and then flowing into our and the community's latest news and events;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>you can subscribe to site updates by email or RSS (both if you're really keen); and<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>you can still subscribe to the traditional community mailing list for email-based discussion with community members.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</pre>




<p>You'll also notice that we've removed the "Creative Commoners" and "Forum" areas that appeared on the old site as these weren't used much in practice. We propose to focus on alternative means of getting the community involved and will be telling you more about that soon.</p>
<p>In terms of what's under the hood, the new site is running on the latest version of WordPress sitting on a virtual private server here in New Zealand. As for plugins, we've kept them to a minimum but are using <a title="Gravity Forms" href="http://www.gravityforms.com/" target="_blank">Gravity Forms</a> for forms, <a title="The Events Calendar" href="http://tri.be/wordpress-events-calendar/" target="_blank">The Events Calendar</a> for events and <a title="BackupBuddy" href="http://pluginbuddy.com/purchase/backupbuddy/" target="_blank">BackupBuddy</a> for, well, backups. Using WordPress, itself a truly open content management system, makes it easier to manage the site and will enable us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>evolve the site over time to meet the needs of the community with a minimum of hassle and cost; and</li>

    <li>enjoy all the other open source goodness surrounding WordPress.</li>

</ul>
<p>We hope you find the site useful.</p>
<p>Oh, and one other thing. We know there are a few loose ends to tidy up in, for example, some of the older post content. We also need to add a few of the more recent posts from the old site to this new one. We'll be working on these things in the coming weeks. The <acronym title="Domain Name System">DNS</acronym>-conscious among you may also notice that the new site is here at <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz">http://creativecommons.org.nz</a>, whereas <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz">http://creativecommons.org.nz</a> will take you to the old site. The final DNS-changes will be made on Monday 9 July and that will result in both URLs taking you to the new site. All good.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards. Keep sharing.</p>

<p>On May 23, the Academic Senate of University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) voted to make all current and future research publicly available. The move follows years of public debate about the rising cost of academic journals and the responsibility of researchers to free up publicly funded research.</p>
<p>UCSF currently receives US$532.8 million from the National Institute of Health, which makes it the largest recipient in the country. This equates to more than 4,500 scientific pages each year.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k77982&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup143448" target="_blank">memorandum on journal pricing</a>, published by the Faculty Advisory Council of Harvard University, pointed out that journal prices had increased 145% over the last six years, far outstripping both the Consumer Price Index and the Higher Education Price Index. The move by UCSF resembles similar moves at Harvard and MIT, and follows an unsuccessful push for open access across the University of California system in 2006.</p>

<strong>THURSDAY 12 July 2012, 6pm-7pm at </strong><a href="http://nethui.org.nz/events" target="_self"><strong>NetHui 2012</strong></a><strong>, SkyCity Convention Centre</strong>
<p>The drive for ‘open’ in tertiary education—be it ‘open education,’ ‘open research’ or ‘open access’—is quickly gaining steam. In May, the academic senate of the University of California San Francisco joined Harvard and MIT to announce that all current and future research would be made available to the public. In December 2011, the British government made a commitment to provide open access to publicly funded data.</p>
<p>At the same time, academics are experiencing tensions between the drive to make publicly funded research openly available and the need to publish in ‘prestige’ journals. International movements such as Open Educational Resources (OER) are helping to guide teachers and researchers through these murky waters.  These movements are also working to lower the cost of producing educational resources, in order to supply them online to educators, for free.</p>
<p>How can twenty-first century researchers and tertiary education providers navigate their rights and responsibilities in regards to their work? How do we help realise ‘Open Research’ and its relationship to ‘Open Government’? What are our expectations for ‘Open Education’?</p>
<p>Join us for an evening of information and discussion on the Open Research and OER Movements in tertiary education.</p>
<p>Speakers will include:</p>
<p>-          Dr Fabiana Kubke, Senior Lecturer, School of Medical Sciences, University of Auckland</p>
<p>-          Professor Anne Fitzgerald, Queensland University of Technology Law Faculty and Creative Commons Australia</p>
<p>-          Dr Wayne Mackintosh, Director Open Education Resource Foundation and Commonwealth of Learning Chair in OER, Otago Polytechnic</p>

<p>UNESCO Asia and the Pacific Regional Bureau for Education, Commonwealth of Learning and Thai Teachers TV recently held a <a href="http://oercongress.weebly.com/asia-pacific.html" target="_self">policy forum on Open Educational Resources</a> (OER). Creative Commons projects from this region <a href="http://wikieducator.org/CC_Asia_Pacific_OER" target="_self">showcased success</a> in the OER movement. Regional meetings lead up to the World OER Congress and the formation of a <a href="http://oercongress.weebly.com/paris-declaration.html" target="_self">Declaration</a> for governments to sign. The Congress will bring together Ministers of Education/Human Resource Development, senior policy makers, expert practitioners, researchers and relevant stakeholders to discuss what works and what won’t work, and to agree on a Declaration with a set of targets for a 2015 World Conference.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>OER In New Zealand</h3>
<p>The New Zealand Government has its own <a title="http://nzgoal.info" href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework</a> which provides guidance for agencies releasing data and content for reuse. The framework recommends CC BY as the default licence for this.</p>
<p>CC New Zealand collaborates with the Ministry of Education to provide professional development for teachers around New Zealand on Creative Commons and OER. We encourage and support schools to follow in the path of <a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School" target="_self">Albany Senior High School</a>, who have a CC intellectual property policy at their school, and utilize open source software.</p>
<p>The <a title="OERF" href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF" target="_self">Open Education Resource Foundation</a> has its base in Otago. <a title="Otago Polytechnic/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic/Home" target="_self">Otago Polytechnic</a> was the first institution in the world to adopt default CC-BY intellectual property policy, and five Kiwi institutions are founding anchor partners of the <a title="OER university/Home" href="http://wikieducator.org/OER_university/Home" target="_self">OERu initiative</a>.</p>
<h3>OER in Australia</h3>

<p>The University of Southern Queensland (USQ) is a strong provider of distance education programs, with 75% of its students studying by distance education. <a title="http://ocw.usq.edu.au" href="http://ocw.usq.edu.au/" target="_self">USQ’s OpenCourseWare (OCW)</a> portal makes 10 courses available under a CC BY-NC-SA license.</p>

It is led by the University of Tasmania and funded by the</p>
<p>Australian Learning and Teaching Council Ltd (ALTC) – now Office of Learning and Teaching (OLT)).</p>
<h3>OER in South Korea</h3>

<p><a title="http://www.snow.or.kr" href="http://www.snow.or.kr/" target="_self">SNOW</a> “Sookmyung Network for Open World” is a community type OER platform that delivers remarkable courseware around the world to a Korean speaking audience. Users can upload OER content to share, discuss with comments, and translate into Korean</p>
<p><a title="http://ocw.korea.edu" href="http://ocw.korea.edu/" target="_self">Korea University’s OCW</a> is the official Open CourseWare site for Korea University and makes course materials available through CC licensing. It holds more than 270 classes, provided by professors who believe in sharing and opening up their resources.</p>
<p>Since 2009, the <a title="http://ocw.ulsan.ac.kr" href="http://ocw.ulsan.ac.kr/" target="_self">University of Ulsan has run its OCW website</a> for students and general users. It shares more than 500 classes by over 24 professors throughout 11 colleges.</p>
<p><a title="http://egoing.net/" href="http://egoing.net/" target="_self">Egoing</a> is a independent blogger who is voluntarily uploading online tutorials. His project has been described as the “Korean IT version of Khan Academy.” His most well-known curriculum “Life Coding” encourages people to become familiar with IT and learn how to code by themselves. This program offers video tutorials, a discussion board, Facebook group, and a mutually shared study schedule. It is an example of how a non-organization initiated open education program can be successful through a self-motivated and dedicated program developer and networking participants.</p>
