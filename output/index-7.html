<p><a href="http://www.theoutlookforsomeday.net/" target="_blank">The Outlook for Someday</a> is a sustainability themed short film competition for young people. The concept is simple: “make a short sustainability-related film” and keep it under five minutes.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, hundreds of young New Zealanders have entered the competition, from primary school students to university graduates.</p>
<p>Like all artists, these young people have been inspired by a range of other works, including documentaries, photos, television, books and music. As we like to say at Creative Commons -- and as Justin Cone puts it in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos/building-on-the-past" target="_blank">this fantastic video</a> --  creativity builds on the past. Until recently, however, filmmakers who wish to remix and reuse have faced a range of legal and technical barriers.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, this situation<strong> </strong>has changed. On the one hand, we’ve seen the rise of digital editing software, which allows young students to edit their footage like professionals. On the other hand, there has been the spectacular growth of Creative Commons works.</p>
<p>Many young filmmakers have decided to save time and energy by remixing and reusing openly licensed and public domain materials. To do so, they are turning to sites like <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/">DigitalNZ</a> for New Zealand content; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/commons" target="_blank">Flickr</a> for photos; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/creative_commons" target="_blank">Youtube</a> for video; <a href="posts/2012/08/27/www.jamendo.com/en" target="_blank">Jamendo</a> for music; and <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikimedia </a>for content from the public domain.</p>
<p>Nathan Parker, principal of <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/warrington-school/" target="_blank">Warrington School </a>on the Otago coast, pointed his students to Vimeo, where students came across documentaries with Creative Commons licences. “The students could use the footage in their own film, and give it their own interpretation,” Nathan says. “It’s just great.”</p>
<p>The supreme winners in 2011 were Susan &amp; Andrew Wardell, with their film<a href="http://www.theoutlookforsomeday.net/films/2011/029/" target="_blank"> ‘Shopping for Our Future.’</a> The short film used a range of public domain resources to discuss the ethics of consumer culture. As the creators put it, “How do our shopping decisions affect the world we live in? What choice do we have?”</p>
<p>[vimeo 32442780 w=500 h=375]</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/32442780">Shopping for Our Future</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/tofs">The Outlook for Someday</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Winning films from 2012’s The Outlook for Someday will be featured on TVNZ’s <em>U Live</em>, TV2’s <em>The Erin Simpson Show</em>, <em>What Now</em> and <em>I AM TV</em> (TV2) and TV One’s <em>Tagata Pasifika. </em></p>

<p>After the earthquake in Canterbury, several New Zealand government agencies – following the <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_blank">NZGOAL</a> framework – released their photos, videos and data under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>At the time, this meant that the public could post, reuse and share the latest information about the extent of the disaster. In 2012, these resources constitute an extraordinary – and extraordinarily open – archive. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Land Information New Zealand <a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/3185-christchurch-post-earthquake-aerial-photos-24-feb-2011/?embed=1" target="_blank">released their aerial photography on the Koordinates platform</a>, which is still their most popular download.</p>

<p>The New Zealand Defence Force also released <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nzdefenceforce/sets/?&amp;page=2" target="_blank">their aerial photography</a> under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/1688/chistchurch-defence-force/" rel="attachment wp-att-1690"><img class=" wp-image-1690" title="Chistchurch defence force" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Chistchurch-defence-force.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="304"></a> Christchurch from the air, after the earthquake, via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nzdefenceforce/5469814540/sizes/z/in/set-72157625987305601/">Flickr</a>.

<p>As we reported <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2011/04/post-quake-imagery-of-christchurch-carries-cc-licence/" target="_blank"> at the time</a>, Civil Defence also released footage of inner-city Christchurch under an open Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbXJJN9ZSFc]</p>
<p>After the earthquake, public institutions like the Christchurch City Library, the National Library of New Zealand and Canterbury University formed the <a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/" target="_blank">CEISMIC Consortium</a> and began to call for people who experienced the earthquake to share their stories and photos online.</p>
<p>They developed several websites, including <a href="http://www.quakestories.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Quake Stories</a> and a section of <a href="http://http://ketechristchurch.peoplesnetworknz.info/canterbury_earthquakes_2010_2011" target="_blank">Kete Christchurch</a>. Most of the stories and photos on these sites have been given a Creative Commons 3.0 New Zealand licence, to make sure the public has advance permission to share and reuse the works.</p>
<p>Most recently, the plan for the <a href="http://ccdu.govt.nz/the-plan" target="_blank">Christchurch Recover Plan</a> was published with a Creative Commons Attribution licence.</p>

             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2012-08-12T23:56:11+12:00">2012-08-12 23:56</time>

<p style="text-align: left;">In April 2010, Wellington City Council started <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/wcc/" target="_blank">to release spatial data on Koordinates</a>, a platform for hosting and viewing geospatial datasets.</p>
<p>The council’s spatial data – which includes aerial photography, contours, parks, pipes, windzones and walkways – had always been available for Wellington residents. Before 2010, however, users had to send a request to the council; they also had to pay a processing fee.</p>
<p>The purpose of the fee, as Senior Spatial Functional Analyst Andrew Shakes puts it, was to recover some of the money spent gathering the data. “In reality,” Andrew says, “council staff had to manually extract data for each request and the user fees often did not cover the council’s processing costs."</p>
<p>More importantly, the fees and processing time appear to have dissuaded many ratepayers from making use of council data. Andrew estimates that “when we were responding to ad hoc requests, we’d probably process several a week.”</p>
<p>Since the release of the council’s spatial data, use has risen dramatically: In the last two years, the council’s <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/wcc/#/layer/1479-wellington-city-1m-contours-2009/" target="_blank">1m Contours</a> layer has been downloaded 3000 times; the <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/wcc/#/layer/1474-wellington-city-building-footprints/" target="_blank">Building Footprints</a> layer, which represents rooftop outlines in Wellington city, has been downloaded 3500 times.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the popularity of the spatial data is the ease with which it can be viewed and downloaded. Anyone can visit the Koordinates platform and see the data displayed on a map of Wellington city. As CEO and co-founder of Koordinates Ed Corkery <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/10/koordinates-the-one-place-for-geodata/" target="_blank">explains</a>, “When you add a map layer, the actual data is converted into a simple Google Maps view and displayed in your web browser.”</p>
<p>A user could, for example, choose to overlay contour lines and potential flooding areas onto a Google map of Wellington City—and then download it, for free, to use in their own CAD or GIS software.</p>
<p>This is saving the council a great deal of time. As Andrew puts it, “Rather than people asking us for monthly data updates that we have to extract manually, and charge them for, we can set something up that does it automatically.”</p>
<p>Koordinates also hosts datasets from public agencies like <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/linz/" target="_blank">LINZ</a>, <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/statsnz/" target="_blank">Statistics New Zealand</a> and <a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/porirua-city-council/" target="_blank">Porirua City Co</a><a href="http://koordinates.com/maps/porirua-city-council/" target="_blank">uncil</a>. One of the sites most popular layers, <a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/3185-christchurch-post-earthquake-aerial-photos-24-feb-2011/" target="_blank">aerial photos of Christchurch after the 2010 earthquake</a>, has been viewed over 77 000 times.</p>
<p>The council has chosen to give the data a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>, the most open Creative Commons licence. “We’ve got to focus on what’s best for our ratepayers,” Andrew explains. “If a ratepayer wants an aerial photo, why not make it freely available to them? They’re paying for it through their rates anyway. Also, we want the economy to grow, we want businesses to be able to use the data. This process allows 24/7 access and saves money as there is less need for manual processing by Council staff.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geospatial.govt.nz/productivityreport/" target="_blank">A 2009 report</a> commissioned by Land Information New Zealand and the Ministry for the Environment concluded that the New Zealand economy would receive a boost of at least $481 million from the release of spatial data. Since then, Cabinet has approved <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_blank">New Zealand Government Open Access Licensing framework</a>, known as NZGOAL, in August 2010. The framework encourages government agencies to release their data under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>Although the release of the council’s spatial data has been extremely popular, not all council data can be released under Creative Commons. As Andrew explains, sometimes the copyright to council data is held by other organisations. The council also has to think about privacy and liability. Andrew’s team ensures that its data is kept up to date. “We don’t just put the data out there... you’ve got to think about how the data is going to be maintained.”</p>
<p>In releasing its data under a Creative Commons licence, Wellington City Council joins many other public agencies, including Statistics New Zealand, LINZ, the Ministry for the Environment, Wellington Regional Council and, most recently, the New Zealand Transport Agency.</p>
<p>As Mayor Celia Wade-Brown <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK1102/S00713/geospatial-goldmine-ready-for-public-use.htm" target="_blank">put it in 2011</a>, the council's spatial data is “a goldmine of information.”</p>
<p>“Whether it’s a Government organisation, community group, businesses or individuals using it – this information aids decision-making and it will allow many projects or initiatives to be completed more quickly, cheaply and effectively.”</p>

<p>A decade ago, these collections were difficult for most New Zealanders to access, especially for those who lived outside of Wellington. Since then, the team at Te Papa has been working on digitising their collection of over 2 million items. In 2005, after years of work, Te Papa launched <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Collections Online</a>, a search engine for Te Papa's collections; it was relaunched in its current format in 2009.</p>
<p>As Adrian Kingston, Collections Information Manager for Digital Assets and Development, wrote <a href="posts/blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2009/06/11/te-papas-collections-and-digitisation/" target="_blank">at the time</a>, "Te Papa’s collections have been built over nearly 150 years and range from miniscule <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=136235">lice </a>and <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=159261">molluscs </a>through to <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=626335">caravans</a>, <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=38080">22m long artworks</a> and <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?term=colossal&amp;imagesonly=on">colossal squid</a>... A collection this diverse can create a number of headaches when it comes to digitisation."</p>
<p>Some of these headaches are technical; others are legal. Before any item can be reproduced online, the team at Te Papa have to figure out if they have the right to do so. This can be an arduous process. As a result, as Victoria Leachman, Rights Manager at Te Papa, puts it, “our focus at Te Papa has been on accessibility, rather than reuse."</p>
<p>The result, though, is an outstanding digital archive, currently consisting of over 200 000 objects. This is a fantastic resources for students, researchers and members of the public.</p>
<p>In a digital environment, however, many visitors to Te Papa's collections want to share, remix and reuse the images and data they find. Recognising this, Victoria and her team have been steadily applying Creative Commons licences to thousands of items. The team, as Victoria puts it, has been “nibbling away at the edges of the collections."</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/kiwi-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1729"><img class=" wp-image-1729 " title="Kiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Kiwi-300x212.png" alt="" width="300" height="212"></a> <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=159924&amp;imagesonly=true&amp;term=kiwi">Little Spotted Kiwi</a> by J.G. Keulemans, 1872. New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. No known copyright restrictions. (O.009829)</p>
<p>In 2008, as an initial experiment with open licensing, Te Papa applied a Creative Commons licence to 21 audio guides for its <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/ritaangus/downloads.aspx" target="_blank">Rita Angus: Life and Vision exhib</a><a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/ritaangus/downloads.aspx" target="_blank">ition</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, applying Creative Commons licences has been a work in progress. Because Te Papa doesn’t always own the copyright to its collections, the process of giving Creative Commons licenses can be complex. The team at Te Papa has spent six years researching the copyright on its images.</p>
<p>Te Papa itself also produces a vast amount of material. These images have been easier to license: So far, thousands of images in its <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/theme.aspx?irn=2848" target="_blank">Natural Environment Collections</a> have been given a Creative Commons licence, such as Kea, Nestor Notabilis, above. Thousands of other works have been labelled 'no known copyright restrictions,' which lets users know that to the knowledge of Te Papa, the work has fallen into the public domain.</p>
<p>The team has already seen some exciting example of reuse, including posts in Dr David's Winter's <a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/the-atavism/2012/08/05/sunday-spinelessness-how-snails-conquered-the-land-again-and-again/" target="_blank">The Atavism</a>, hosted by <a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/" target="_blank">Sciblogs</a>.</p>
<p>Other works from Te Papa can be found in its <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tepapa/" target="_blank">Flickr stream</a>. Te Papa also holds the copyright to a few of the objects in its art collections, allowing it to participate in the <a href="http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/te-papa/" target="_blank">Google Art Project</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to its images and artworks, Te Papa produces a vast amount of original research. Like other organisations, Te Papa is confronting the trend towards open access. In 2011, researchers from Te Papa published a paper in <em>Scientific Reports</em> on the "slime defence mechanism" of the Hagfish. The researchers licensed the paper Creative Commons BY-NC-ND, and made it available on <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/2011/111027/srep00131/full/srep00131.html" target="_blank">Nature.com</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/te-papa-image/" rel="attachment wp-att-1738"><img class=" wp-image-1738 " title="Te Papa image" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Te-Papa-image.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="231"></a> <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/ObjectDetails.aspx?oid=112618&amp;coltype=Photography&amp;regno=C.001444">Lava flow from the eruption of the Matavanu Volcano on Savai'i</a> by Thomas Andrews 1905-1910, New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. No known copyright restrictions. (C.001444)</p>
<p>They also released, as the wonderful press release put it, "graphic underwater footage showing for the first time how the primitive hagfish – also known as the snot-eel – defends itself by emitting a choking, gill-clogging slime." Because both the paper and the footage were available under an open licence, the findings were covered by news organisations like TVNZ and <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDIQqQIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stuff.co.nz%2Fnational%2F5868827%2FAmazing-footage-How-the-hagfish-repels-predators%2F&amp;ei=ipY-UOiyNofzmAWCtICADQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7Ba6mBvax-wC5SpMgNaRPgkFPnQ&amp;sig2=BLJnyMbcoj4nF6PQodQl8A" target="_blank">Stuff.co.nz</a>.</p>
<p>Victoria and Adrian both acknowledge that there is still a lot of work to do. Currently, Collections Online doesn’t allow users to filter by license type, meaning that it can be hard to find content licensed under Creative Commons.There is also work to do in making it easier to download low resolution images for non-commercial use from the website.</p>
<p>Te Papa uses a BY-NC-ND copyright license as the museum charges for commercial use of its images through the Te Papa Picture Library.</p>
<p>There are also issues of moral rights, cultural rights and 'orphan works,' those works that are still under copyright but that have no obvious copyright owner. Victoria and others at Te Papa are working on addressing these issues, while respecting the rights of those who donate their collections.</p>
<p>In working towards open licensing, Te Papa joins a host of museums and art galleries from around the world. Notable examples of institutions using Creative Commons licenses include the <a href="http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/free-download-of-art-works/" target="_blank">The National Gallery of Denmark</a>, <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/" target="_blank">The National Portrait Gallery</a> in the UK, and <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/copyright.php" target="_blank">Brooklyn Museum</a> in the US. In May of this year, <a href="http://thewalters.org/news/releases/pressdetail.aspx?e_id=385" target="_blank">Walters Art Museum</a> uploaded over 19 000 openly licensed images of artworks to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Collections_of_the_Walters_Art_Museum" target="_blank">Wikimedia</a>.</p>

Released into the public domain by its author, Nankai, via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Orokonui_valley.jpg">Wikieducator</a>
<p><a href="http://wikieducator.org/Warrington_School" target="_blank">Warrington School</a> is a small primary school in Otago’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueskin_Bay" target="_blank">Blueskin Bay</a>. With five teachers and around fifty students, Warrington has embraced both open source software and Creative Commons licences.</p>
<p>Warrington’s principal, Nathan Parker, came to Creative Commons licences through open software like Ubuntu, Linux and Open Office. Wayne Mackintosh, of the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resources Foundation</a>, noticed what Warrington was doing, and invited Nathan to start sharing teaching resources on <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikieducator</a>.</p>
<p>Hosted by Otago Polytechnic, Wikieducator is a platform for teachers across the world to share, remix and reuse educational materials. Dozens of schools around New Zealand are using the wiki through <a href="http://wikieducator.org/New_Zealand_Schools_OER_Portal" target="_blank">New Zealand’s Open Educational Resources portal</a>.</p>
<p>However, as Nathan quickly discovered, the school's Board of Trustees held the copyright to all  resources produced by Warrington's teachers. "We soon realized," Nathan says, "that we can’t put our resources on the wiki, because we as teachers don’t own it." By sharing their teaching resources on Wikieducator, the teachers of Warrington School were breaking the law.</p>
<p>In order to prevent copyright violation, the school “needed to formalise the change through a creative commons policy.” As was the case with <a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/" target="_blank">Albany Senior High School</a>, Nathan found that his Board of Trustees was “very happy” to give advance permission for teachers to share their resources. The board saw that “being able to share ideas and allowing other teachers to improve or add to our teaching resources was a smart move for education.”</p>

<p>Other smart moves include the use of open source software. Instead of using proprietary software packages, provided for a fee by large for-profit companies like Microsoft and Apple, Warrington makes use of free, open source alternatives. As a result, Warrington is one of the few New Zealand schools not to pay copyright fees.</p>
<p>Nathan hopes that more schools decide to work with openly licensed software and teaching resources. He points to Portugal and <a href="http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/iceland-open-source-public-secto-68719" target="_blank">Iceland</a> as examples of countries using open source software across their education systems, saving their governments millions of dollars in licensing agreements</p>
<p>Warrington also encourages its students to use Creative Commons licensed material in their projects. Two of Nathan's students are planning to enter <a href="http://www.theoutlookforsomeday.net/" target="_blank">Outlook for Someday</a>, a sustainability themed documentary competition. Nathan pointed them to <a href="http://vimeo.com/tag:creativecommons" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>, where the students came across documentaries with Creative Commons licences. “The students could use the footage in their own film, and give it their own interpretation," Nathan says. “It’s just great.”</p>
<p>Warrington School also runs its own radio station, <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Blueskin_Bay_FM" target="_blank">Blueskin Bay FM</a>. The station hosts student and community programmes, and plays music with Creative Commons licenses. As Nathan explains, "If we play copyright music, we have to pay licensing fees. Using Creative Commons music, we don’t need to ask permission, and we don’t need to pay, and the radio station just ticks along.”</p>
<p>After moving to open source software and Creative Commons licensing, Warrington has found a greater awareness of copyright and open licensing in the students, the teachers, and even the wider community.</p>
<p>“When I look outside at other schools, I think, why aren’t you doing this?”</p>

<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/understand-and-teach-creative-commons/creativecommonskiwi/" rel="attachment wp-att-1590"><img class="wp-image-1590 aligncenter" title="creativecommonskiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/creativecommonskiwi-300x278.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="189"></a>In my experience, many teachers--and most students--would rather not think about copyright. In this respect, they resemble just about every other person on the planet. Copyright is an undeniably thorny topic, full of arcane details and legal minutiae: most of us would, understandably, rather not spend our time studying the fine print of the <a href="http://www.copyright.org.nz/legislation.php" target="_blank">Copyright Act. </a>
<p>But copyright is not something teachers can easily avoid. Most of the educational resources used by teachers are locked under copyright; the copyright to all the resources teachers produce is held by their respective Board of Trustees. At the same time, sharing, remix and reuse is fundamental to teaching. After all, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb0syrgsH6M" target="_blank">without sharing, there is no education</a>."</p>
<p>Digital technologies promise to make sharing educational resources much easier. In theory, the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) promised with the <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/EducationInitiatives/UFBInSchools/ANetworkForLearning.aspx" target="_blank">Network for Learning</a> (N4L) could enable every school in New Zealand to work together, a truly exciting possibility. Under existing copyright legislation, however, teachers are not allowed to remix, adapt and share copyright materials across the N4L.</p>
<p>This is where Creative Commons can help. Creative Commons provides the tools that enable sharing to occur. Our licences are legally robust and--unlike most copyright legislation--human-readable.</p>
<p>Using Creative Commons licences, teachers can make and share open education resources across the N4L. Teachers can also use Creative Commons licences to teach their students about copyright, attribution and referencing--an increasingly essential part of the curriculum.</p>
<p>But if learning about copyright is difficult, teaching it can be even harder. To this end, we've put together some resources for Creative Commons champions across the country. We want you to help us spread the word about Creative Commons.</p>
<ul>
<li>The National Library has put out this <a href="http://schools.natlib.govt.nz/sites/schools.natlib.govt.nz/files/services-to-schools-poster-creative-commons-in-classroom.pdf" target="_blank">rather brilliant poster</a>.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>We've put together this <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank">template slide show</a>, for everyone to share, remix and reuse. Use it in your classes, conferences and professional development days. Email us at admin@creativecommons.org.nz if you want the script. Let us know if you make a better version, and we'll put it on our website.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The latest issue of <a href="http://interfaceonline.co.nz/" target="_blank">Interface Magazine</a> has an A3 pull-out poster for students and teachers. A version of the poster is <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Creative-Commons-for-Schools-poster.pdf" target="_blank">here,</a> though you'll need to get the magazine for the glossy original!</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Creative Commons champion Helen Baxter, who runs Mohawk Media, has written <a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/remix-columns" target="_blank">a series of columns</a> on how to use and reuse Creative Commons resources for the NZTA Remix competition.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>The National Library (again!) have made a guide to remixing materials, <a href="http://schools.natlib.govt.nz/21st-century-literacy-inquiry/sources-resources/guide-reusing-digital-content" target="_blank">Free To Mix</a>. This is an excellent home-grown guide. As a living document, it is continually updated.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>We have a box of brochures sitting in our office. Email  us if you want some to share with your classroom, conference, library or colleagues.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Creative Commons Australia have these <a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/learn-more/fact-sheets" target="_blank">slideshows and factsheets</a> for educators.</li>

</ul>

             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2012-07-23T09:54:37+12:00">2012-07-23 09:54</time>

<p></p>
<p>In 2012, Auckland’s <a href="http://www.ashs.school.nz/" target="_blank">Albany Senior High School </a>adopted a Creative Commons policy, and thus became New Zealand’s first fully open-source school. The policy ensures that all teaching materials and policies produced at ASHS are given a default Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence.</p>
<p>Currently, the copyright to all teaching materials produced by New Zealand teachers is held by their respective schools’ Boards of Trustees. As Albany Senior High School Deputy Principal Mark Osborne points out, “Sharing resources is something teachers have done since teaching started... and most people don’t realise they’re breaking the law by doing that.”<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/200px-ashs_logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-1511"><img class="size-full wp-image-1511 alignright" title="200px-ASHS_logo" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/200px-ASHS_logo.png" alt="" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
<p>Albany Senior High School’s Creative Commons policy allows—and even encourages—teachers to, as Mark puts it, “share the family silver.” Many of ASHS’s teachers work on WikiEducator, an initiative of the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resource Foundation</a>, hosted at New Zealand’s <a href="http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/" target="_blank">Otago Polytechnic</a>.

<p>In 2012, Auckland’s <a href="http://www.ashs.school.nz/" target="_blank">Albany Senior High School </a>adopted a Creative Commons policy, and thus became New Zealand’s first fully open-source school. The policy ensures that all teaching materials and policies produced at ASHS are given a default Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence.</p>
<p>Currently, the copyright to all teaching materials produced by New Zealand teachers is held by their respective schools’ Boards of Trustees. As Albany Senior High School Deputy Principal Mark Osborne points out, “Sharing resources is something teachers have done since teaching started... and most people don’t realise they’re breaking the law by doing that.”<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/200px-ashs_logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-1511"><img class="size-full wp-image-1511 alignright" title="200px-ASHS_logo" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/200px-ASHS_logo.png" alt="" width="200" height="150"></a></p>
<p>Albany Senior High School’s Creative Commons policy allows—and even encourages—teachers to, as Mark puts it, “share the family silver.” Many of ASHS’s teachers work on WikiEducator, an initiative of the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resource Foundation</a>, hosted at New Zealand’s <a href="http://www.otagopolytechnic.ac.nz/" target="_blank">Otago Polytechnic</a>. ASHS contributed to WikiEducator, Mark says, “because we want to be open and collaborative.”</p>
