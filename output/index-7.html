<h5>I've heard of Creative Commons, but I'm not really sure what it is.</h5>
<p>Fair enough. In a nutshell, the most open Creative Commons licences allow your audience to share, remix and reuse your work, without having to ask your permission in advance. For more details, check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/25684782"> this video</a>, have a look at <a title="Resources" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank">our resources page</a>, peruse the range of<a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos" target="_blank"> international videos</a> and then, if you've still got any questions, flick me an email: admin@creativecommons.org.nz</p>
<h5>If I use Creative Commons, I won't be able to make any money, right?</h5>

<p>Wrong. There's nothing about using a Creative Commons licence that stops you from making money. Remember, with Creative Commons licences, you keep your copyright. All the licences do is give your audience advance permission to share your work.</p>
<h5>But if I give my work an open licence, how will I make money?</h5>

<p>Fair question. There are a variety of possible models. If you're a painter, you might share digital copies of your work to generate publicity, and to attract buyers beyond the relatively small New Zealand art scene. If you're a musician, you might use an open licence to sell tickets to your shows. If you're a writer, you might decide that releasing a digital copy, with all the free distribution and publicity this implies, will increase sales at book-stores.</p>
<h5>Will this really work for everyone?</h5>

<p>There are no guarantees, but an open licence means that the potential pool of people interested in your work--and willing to pay for some version of it--is many, many times larger. It's worth remembering that most New Zealand artists don't make a living selling their work, but have to rely on support from funding agencies like Creative NZ or, more likely, hold down a day job.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2009-02-25-magicpen_031.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2067" title="2009-02-25-magicpen_03" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2009-02-25-magicpen_031.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="433"></a> A page from <a href="posts/2012/10/02/hicksvillecomics.com/magicpen/?p=28">Sam Zabel and the Magic Pen</a>, by Dylan Horrocks. Made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 New Zealand License.</a></p>
<h5>It sounds a bit radical for me. What's wrong with the old models of production and distribution?</h5>

<p>Quite simply, they pre-date the internet. Digital production and distribution channels provide artists with much larger potential audiences. At the very least, artists should consider pursuing both models at once, using online publicity to drive more conventional, off-line opportunities.</p>
<h5>Right. But what's this got to do with Creative Commons?</h5>

<p>Creative Commons licences give your audience permission to share and--if you decide to adopt our free culture licences--remix and reuse your work. This will ensure your work is experienced by as many people as possible.Â  Without an open licence, it is illegal for your audience to share or reuse your work.</p>
<h5>Do I have to licence everything?</h5>

<p>Nope. While some people like to licence everything they make, others choose to dip their toes in the Creative Commons waters. Gary Henderson, a playwright and theatre director, chose <a href="http://www.rocketman.co.nz/free/index.html" target="_blank">to licence a few scripts</a>. <a href="http://jemshed.com/" target="_blank">Jem Yoshioka </a>published an entire comic, <em><a href="http://jemshed.theotherwalls.com/comic/sunshine/" target="_blank">Sunshine</a></em>, on her website, while Gary Peters put up some <a href="http://www.garypeters.info/" target="_blank">images of his installations</a>. While Dylan Horrocks's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hicksville_%28comics%29" target="_blank"><em>Hicksville</em></a> is published under full copyright,<a href="http://hicksvillecomics.com/" target="_blank"> the comics on his website</a> are all made available under a Creative Commons Attribution Non Commerial licence.</p>
<h5>I'm not a lawyer. Isn't this going to be a hassle?</h5>

<p>Wrong again. Creative Commons licences are free and easy to understand. While we love to hear from licence users, you don't even need to register: all you need to do is figure out which licence you'd like to use, then copy and paste the icon and licensing statement from the Creative Commons website. The Creative Commons icon contains HTML metadata, enabling search engines to find your work. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/" target="_blank">With our new licensing tool</a>, it really is ridiculously easy.</p>
<h5>But I don't read legalese. How do I know what I'm getting myself into?</h5>

<p>I sympathise. But unlike many legal documents, our licences have been specially translated into <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">human-readable language</a>, so you and your audience know exactly what kind of licence you're providing.</p>
<h5>I've licensed my work. What happens next?</h5>

<p>Here's the thing: We actually have no idea. No one does. That's the beauty of an open licence; it's also the beauty of the internet. Because works with a Creative Commons licence can be freely shared, your work could travel around the world. This might not necessarily happen to your work, though under the default All Rights Reserved of full copyright, your audience would have to break the law for this happen.<em></em></p>
<h5>Give me some success stories.</h5>

<p>Alright. Your openly licensed work might, like Bronwyn Holloway Smith's <a href="http://bronwyn.co.nz/projects/gifts/" target="_blank">Ghosts in the Form of Gifts</a>, get picked up for <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/bronwyn-holloway-smith/" target="_blank">an American art show</a>. It could, like Disasteradio, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/03/luke-rowell-disasteradio/" target="_blank">help you tour the world</a>. Your work could, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/09/how-a-19-year-old-student-became-one-of-the-hottest-political-photographers-in-the-country/" target="_blank">like nineteen year old American photographer Gage Skidmore</a>, end up featuring in major newspapers and magazines, including The Atlantic and American news network MSNBC.</p>
<h5>Impressive, but how will people know it's my work?</h5>

<p>The six main Creative Commons licences all requires users to provide attribution, including a link back to the original work. This means that everyone who sees your work will always know the original author and be able to visit your website.</p>
<h5>What if people don't follow the conditions of the licence?</h5>

<p>If people break the conditions of your licence, then the licence is revoked.</p>
<h5>Tell me again why I'd want to use Creative Commons?</h5>

<p>There's a bunch of reasons. It might be because you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximise exposure and increase distribution;</li>

    <li>Use an innovative business model;</li>

    <li>Contribute to and participate in the public sphere;</li>

    <li>Encourage collaboration; or,</li>

    <li>Grow the commons.</li>

</ul>
<h5>If I do this, will you help spread the word?</h5>

<p>Sure. We're always looking for new <a href="http://http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/case-studies/" target="_blank">case studies</a>. Give us an email and let us know what you've been working on: admin@creativecommons.org.nz</p>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p></p>
<p>Here's something most of us can agree on: New Zealand culture is far more vibrant than the arts coverage of our major media organisations suggests. According to <a href="http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/assets/paperclip/publication_documents/documents/210/original/new_zealanders_and_the_arts_full_report_final_for_web.pdf?1338201080" target="_blank">a study by Creative New Zealand</a>, 80% of New Zealanders attended an arts event in 2011 (8). If we widen the range to 2008-2011, that figure rises to 95% (9). 87% agreed that "the arts are good for you"; 80% felt that "the arts help define who we are as New Zealanders" (16).</p>
<p>Good news, then: The arts in New Zealand are fairly strong, and, as the surveys from <a href="http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/assets/ckeditor/attachments/82/arts-survey-06.pdf?1296979201" target="_blank">2005</a> and <a href="http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/assets/ckeditor/attachments/17/new_zealanders_and_the_arts_-_attitudes_attendance_and_participation_in_2008.pdf" target="_blank">2008</a> suggest, they have been for a while now.</p>
<p>But while our attitudes to the arts might not be changing, the way our young people <em>participate</em> in the arts certainly is. As the authors conclude,</p>
<p></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Around four in every five (83%) young people that we surveyed said they have used a computer to create their own art in the past 12 months. Digital art has emerged as the artform that young people most want to be more involved with (9).</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, if we consider the population as a whole, the figure that has "used a computer to create an original work of art" drops to<em> 22%</em> (15).</p>
<p>It's common for older generations to see digital arts practice as a kind of fad and to dismiss terms like "remix," "tweak," &amp; "mashup" as nothing more than new media buzzwords; but these figures give some substance to the hype. According to Creative NZ, more kids want to 'mix &amp; mash' than act, or paint, or write. Far from being a fad, it seems more accurate to say that online remix culture is on its way to becoming the dominant mode of cultural expression in Aotearoa.</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKSjs-5Yuto</p>
<p>[Manny's Story, by Casey Carsel, which won a <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/2011-winners/" target="_blank">Special Judges Award and Student Prize </a>in Digital NZ's Mix &amp; Mash 2011. Licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution</a>]</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that with the rise of e-books, online video streaming and digital music, all artforms will soon be digital, one way or another. This will make it much easier for New Zealanders to share, remix and reuse their culture. This has the potential to transform both the production <em>and </em>consumption of New Zealand art, as the capacity to spread artworks 'virally,' coupled with free editing tools, enables what we might pompously call the 'democratisation of culture.'</p>
<p>After all, imagine if 80% of New Zealands attended an arts event not once a year, but once a <em>month</em>?</p>
<p>Pompous or otherwise, the figures from CreativeNZ suggest that the next generation of New Zealanders will not see 'culture' or 'art' as the rarefied domain of specialists and professionals (most of them foreign). They will expect their culture to be both available and reusable.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this can occur while our culture is locked under All Rights Reserved -- at least not legally. At the same time, experience tells us that legal barriers are unlikely to stop young people from engaging in their artform of choice. What they are likely to do instead, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gomNxnoHG2U" target="_blank">as Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig spent many years pointing out</a>, is turn our young people into 'pirates' and 'infringers.'</p>
<p>With this in mind, it's clearly important to teach our young people about the enormous range of works already under a Creative Commons licence or in the public domain. But it's also important to expand the range of <em>contemporary</em> works available for sharing and reuse. Our young digital artists need to be able to engage with artworks from their own culture and society, so that they can join our artists in, as the Creative NZ report put it, "defining who we are as New Zealanders."</p>

<p>While there are dozens of search engines and repositories for Creative Commons content, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has a few favourites. This is what we use for our blog posts, slide shows and educational resources.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Â Flickr</h4>

<p>This is an obvious and popular choice: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> is a massive store of openly licensed photos from around the world. Currently, they have over 220 million photos using a Creative Commons licence. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/commons" target="_blank">Flickr Commons</a> has also partnered with dozens of public memory institutions from around the world, including NASA, the US National Archives and the National Library of New Zealand, to provide access to archival images.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Compfight</h4>

<p><a href="http://compfight.com/" target="_blank">Compfight</a> is an attractive, easy to use search engine. They make use of the Flickr API, which means that their search results will link back to photos found on Flickr.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Photopin</h4>

<p><a href="http://photopin.com/" target="_blank">Photopin</a> is one of my favourites. As with Compfight, the photos come from Flickr. The tool is incredibly easy to use, and the results page really is quite nice:</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-images/penguin-search-photopin-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-1910"><img class="wp-image-1910 aligncenter" title="penguin search photopin" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/penguin-search-photopin2.png" alt="" width="474" height="256"></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Open Clipart</h4>

<p><a href="http://openclipart.org/" target="_blank">Open Clipart</a> is the world's largest collaborative community to share, remix and reuse clipart. All of their images are released into the public domain. This means that you don't even need to provide attribution (though it's usually good manners to link back to the original).</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Wikimedia Commons</h4>

<p>If you're looking for paintings, drawings or older photography, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons </a>is your best bet. They have nearly 14 million media files that are either out of copyright or under a Creative Commons licence, including images from major international art galleries.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">The Noun Project</h4>

<p><a href="http://thenounproject.com/" target="_blank">The Noun Project</a> are new in town, but they've quickly developed a wide range of high quality icons and images for general reuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/7-ways-to-find-creative-commons-images/noun-project/" rel="attachment wp-att-1911"><img class="wp-image-1911 aligncenter" title="Noun Project" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Noun-Project.png" alt="" width="633" height="216"></a></p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">Â Digital NZ</h4>

<p>We've saved the best for last: <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">Digital NZ's search engine</a>, which provides access to media from dozens of institutions from across New Zealand. If you want New Zealand content, this is the place to go. They also allow you to make shareable 'sets' of works you've found, to show off your weird and wonderful search results.Â <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/blog/posts/so-many-sets" target="_blank">Here's a list of the top 50 sets.</a></p>

<p>Welcome to the first instalment of Friday Commons. I spend a lot of my time carping on about some of the great &amp; odd &amp; impossibly interesting material available for creative reuse. Sometimes I like to spread the word about <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/08/22/the-lancashire-witches-1612-2012/" target="_blank">witches</a>; at other times, I talk about <a href="http://t.co/w9ALCkuZ" target="_blank">poetry</a>, or <a href="http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/te-papa/" target="_blank">paintings</a>,or <a href="http://t.co/mttUKDfC" target="_blank">Pukeho</a>. I once linked to a <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/08/16/the-bestiarium-of-aloys-zotl-1831-1887/" target="_blank">Bestiarium</a>.</p>
<p>As all librarians and historians already know, the commons is a richer and stranger place than most of us ever suspected. So, why not bring some of this to the Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand website?</p>
<p>Let's get into it. First, we have The Walrus, from the nineteenth century Austrian painter Aloys ZÃ¶tl, part of his <em>Bestiarium</em>. Read more about it at <a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/08/16/the-bestiarium-of-aloys-zotl-1831-1887/" target="_blank"><em>The Public Domain Review</em></a>. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/friday-commons-1/769px-aloys_zotl_der_see-elefant-the-walrus/" rel="attachment wp-att-1840"><img class="wp-image-1840 aligncenter" title="769px-Aloys_ZÃ¶tl,_Der_See-Elefant -- The Walrus" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/769px-Aloys_Z%C3%B6tl_Der_See-Elefant-The-Walrus-300x234.jpg" alt="" width="353" height="275"></a></p>
<p>While I'm looting material from The Public Domain Review, I'll point you to the spectacularly titled <em><a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924021236017#page/n11/mode/2up" target="_blank">The Criminal Prosecution and Capital Punishment of Animals</a></em>, 1906, by EP Evans. That link takes you to the whole book, which you can read, if you'd like. For now, though, I'll give you this: 'Trial of a Sow and Pigs at Lavegny,' from <em>The Book of Days</em> (1863) edited by Robert Chambers<em></em>, found in <a href="http://http://publicdomainreview.org/2011/03/27/bugs-and-beasts-before-the-law/" target="_blank">Nicholas Humphrey's great piece on animals on trial</a>.</p>

<em>This post was originally published in the August 27 print edition of the Gazette Focus, a supplement to the <a href="http://www.edgazette.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Education Gazette</a></em>.
<p>In 2013, the Ministry of Education will begin to roll out <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/theMinistry/EducationInitiatives/UFBInSchools.aspx" target="_blank">Ultra Fast Broadband in the Network for Learning (N4L)</a>. This will give teachers and students âultra fastâ access to a global archive of digital educational resources. Ultra fast connection speeds will help New Zealand teachers do what they do best: teach New Zealand kids to understand and critique our rich cultural and intellectual heritage.</p>
<p>This is a truly exciting development. Teachers will be able to easily share, remix and reuse resources; students will be able to critically engage with an extraordinary range of online materials. There is enormous potential for collaboration between schools across New Zealand.</p>
<p>But what about when the tools of the tradeâthe educational resources themselvesâare locked under copyright? This is notoriously murky territory. While teachers have some <a href="http://www.copyright.org.nz/viewInfosheet.php?sheet=439" target="_blank">special permissions under the Copyright Act</a>, they do not have the right to adapt and re-release copyright materials.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/understand-and-teach-creative-commons/creativecommonskiwi/" rel="attachment wp-att-1590"><img class=" wp-image-1590 alignright" title="creativecommonskiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/creativecommonskiwi.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="302"></a> With such uncertainties, teachers may decide not to risk adapting and sharing resources across the N4L. This threatens to undermine the purpose of the N4L itself, which is intended, <a href="http://www.edgazette.govt.nz/Articles/Article.aspx?ArticleId=8561" target="_blank">as the <em>Education Gazette </em>reported in April</a>, âto encourage collaboration and sharing of resources and knowledge between school communities and learners around New Zealand.â</p>
<p>This is where Creative Commons can help. The Creative Commons licences are robust legal tools that enable users to share, remix and reuse copyright materials; they are quickly applied and easily understood. From a suite of six licences, copyright holders choose from a series of licence conditions. The more restrictive licences prevent derivative works and commercial reuse; the most open licence allows users to adapt, remix and share materials as they wish, as long as they credit the original work.</p>
<p>Realising the potential of digital technologies, some New Zealand schools have decided to adopt <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank">a Creative Commons policy</a>. This automatically grants a Creative Commons licence to all educational materials produced in the school. Teachers are then free to adapt and share their resources without having to ask copyright holdersâthat is, their Boards of Trusteesâfor permission.</p>
<p>These schools are well placed under current Government policy. <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/nzgoal/quick-guide-agencies" target="_blank">The New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework (NZGOAL)</a>, approved by Cabinet on 5 July 2010, invites Boards of Trustees to consider using Creative Commons licences for their teaching resources.</p>
<p>The educational benefits are clear. Since <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/" target="_blank">Albany Senior High School adopted their Creative Commons policy</a>, Deputy Principal Mark Osbourne has noticed that âteachers are collaborating more, and theyâre also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources.â</p>
<p>In taking this step, the teachers of ASHS join a thriving culture of sharing, remix and reuse already embraced by many kiwi students. Adopting a Creative Commons policy, and working with Creative Commons resources, is also good way to educate students about copyright, so that they can stop infringing and start creating.</p>
<p>The commons is growing: There are already between 500 and 700 million Creative Commons licensed resources available for sharing and reuse, and this is growing every day. Institutions using Creative Commons include Wikipedia, The White House and the governments of Australia, New Zealand and the UK.</p>
<p>You can help expand the commons by reusing, remixing and sharing Creative Commons licensed resources. For more information on the licences, as well links to our Creative Commons video, brochure, poster and slideshow presentation, visit us at creativecommons.org.nz.</p>

<p>In 2008, Matthew Poole posted a short piece on a talk by Lawrence Lessig on Russell Brown's <a href="http://publicaddress.net/" target="_blank">Public Address</a> website, and thus spawned what would come to be known as <a href="http://publicaddress.net/speaker/copyright-must-change/"> The Great Copyright Thread of Doom</a>. Spanning "<a href="http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/nethui-its-all-about-you/" target="_blank">89 pages</a>, 2202 comments and [a] dozen or so separate flame wars," the thread captured the <em>sturm und drang</em> typical of many online copyright debates.</p>
<p>While the thread, in all its novelistic glory, covered a range of issues, one of the more tempestuous topics was that of compensation: To wit, if New Zealand artists use open licences, how are they supposed to make a living?</p>
<p>By way of response, many Creative Commons supporters tend to riff on that famous aphorism of <a href="http://openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2002/12/11/piracy.html" target="_blank">Tim O'Reilly</a>, arguing that obscurity is a far greater threat to New Zealand artists than misuse or piracy. Others outline new 'business models' for artists, made possible by dwindling costs of production and distribution.</p>
<p>While it can be fun and enlightening to dive into the murk of online copyright debate, it's worth pointing out that the idea of New Zealand artists using Creative Commons licences to share their work is not some futuristic, speculative fantasy. In fact, a bunch of New Zealand artists having been doing so for a while now.</p>

<p>People at Te Papa have been thinking about Creative Commons licensing for a while now. As our national museum, Te Papa is the kaitiaki of an incredible range of artistic, scientific and cultural items, including paintings, photos, objects, specimens articles and over thirty thousand Taonga MÄori treasures.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/objimage/" rel="attachment wp-att-1728"><img class=" wp-image-1728 " title="objimage" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/objimage-286x300.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="231"></a> <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/ObjectDetails.aspx?oid=225159&amp;coltype=Birds&amp;regno=OR.023944">Kea, Nestor notabilis</a> collected September 1987, Otira, Westland, New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/deed.en">Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 3.0 licence.</a> (OR.023944)</p>
<p>A decade ago, these collections were difficult for most New Zealanders to access, especially for those who lived outside of Wellington. Since then, the team at Te Papa has been working on digitising their collection of over 2 million items. In 2005, after years of work, Te Papa launched <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Collections Online</a>, a search engine for Te Papa's collections; it was relaunched in its current format in 2009.</p>
<p>As Adrian Kingston, Collections Information Manager for Digital Assets and Development, wrote <a href="posts/2012/08/30/blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2009/06/11/te-papas-collections-and-digitisation/" target="_blank">at the time</a>, "Te Papaâs collections have been built over nearly 150 years and range from miniscule <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=136235">lice </a>and <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=159261">molluscs </a>through to <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=626335">caravans</a>, <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=38080">22m long artworks</a> and <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/search.aspx?term=colossal&amp;imagesonly=on">colossal squid</a>... A collection this diverse can create a number of headaches when it comes to digitisation."</p>
<p>Some of these headaches are technical; others are legal. Before any item can be reproduced online, the team at Te Papa have to figure out if they have the right to do so. This can be an arduous process. As a result, as Victoria Leachman, Rights Manager at Te Papa, puts it, âour focus at Te Papa has been on accessibility, rather than reuse."</p>
<p>The result, though, is an outstanding digital archive, currently consisting of over 200 000 objects. This is a fantastic resources for students, researchers and members of the public.</p>
<p>In a digital environment, however, many visitors to Te Papa's collections want to share, remix and reuse the images and data they find. Recognising this, Victoria and her team have been steadily applying Creative Commons licences to thousands of items. The team, as Victoria puts it, has been ânibbling away at the edges of the collections."</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/kiwi-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1729"><img class=" wp-image-1729 " title="Kiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Kiwi-300x212.png" alt="" width="300" height="212"></a> <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=159924&amp;imagesonly=true&amp;term=kiwi">Little Spotted Kiwi</a> by J.G. Keulemans, 1872. New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. No known copyright restrictions. (O.009829)</p>
<p>In 2008, as an initial experiment with open licensing, Te Papa applied a Creative Commons licence to 21 audio guides for its <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/ritaangus/downloads.aspx" target="_blank">Rita Angus: Life and Vision exhib</a><a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/exhibitions/ritaangus/downloads.aspx" target="_blank">ition</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, applying Creative Commons licences has been a work in progress. Because Te Papa doesnât always own the copyright to its collections, the process of giving Creative Commons licenses can be complex. The team at Te Papa has spent six years researching the copyright on its images.</p>
<p>Te Papa itself also produces a vast amount of material. These images have been easier to license: So far, thousands of images in its <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/theme.aspx?irn=2848" target="_blank">Natural Environment Collections</a> have been given a Creative Commons licence, such as Kea, Nestor Notabilis, above. Thousands of other works have been labelled 'no known copyright restrictions,' which lets users know that to the knowledge of Te Papa, the work has fallen into the public domain.</p>
<p>The team has already seen some exciting example of reuse, including posts in Dr David's Winter's <a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/the-atavism/2012/08/05/sunday-spinelessness-how-snails-conquered-the-land-again-and-again/" target="_blank">The Atavism</a>, hosted by <a href="http://sciblogs.co.nz/" target="_blank">Sciblogs</a>.</p>
<p>Other works from Te Papa can be found in its <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tepapa/" target="_blank">Flickr stream</a>. Te Papa also holds the copyright to a few of the objects in its art collections, allowing it to participate in the <a href="http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/te-papa/" target="_blank">Google Art Project</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to its images and artworks, Te Papa produces a vast amount of original research. Like other organisations, Te Papa is confronting the trend towards open access. In 2011, researchers from Te Papa published a paper in <em>Scientific Reports</em> on the "slime defence mechanism" of the Hagfish. The researchers licensed the paper Creative Commons BY-NC-ND, and made it available on <a href="http://www.nature.com/srep/2011/111027/srep00131/full/srep00131.html" target="_blank">Nature.com</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/te-papa-joins-the-commons/te-papa-image/" rel="attachment wp-att-1738"><img class=" wp-image-1738 " title="Te Papa image" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Te-Papa-image.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="231"></a> <a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/ObjectDetails.aspx?oid=112618&amp;coltype=Photography&amp;regno=C.001444">Lava flow from the eruption of the Matavanu Volcano on Savai'i</a> by Thomas Andrews 1905-1910, New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. No known copyright restrictions. (C.001444)</p>
<p>They also released, as the wonderful press release put it, "graphic underwater footage showing for the first time how the primitive hagfish â also known as the snot-eel â defends itself by emitting a choking, gill-clogging slime." Because both the paper and the footage were available under an open licence, the findings were covered by news organisations like TVNZ and <a href="http://www.google.co.nz/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=newssearch&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDIQqQIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stuff.co.nz%2Fnational%2F5868827%2FAmazing-footage-How-the-hagfish-repels-predators%2F&amp;ei=ipY-UOiyNofzmAWCtICADQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7Ba6mBvax-wC5SpMgNaRPgkFPnQ&amp;sig2=BLJnyMbcoj4nF6PQodQl8A" target="_blank">Stuff.co.nz</a>.</p>
<p>Victoria and Adrian both acknowledge that there is still a lot of work to do. Currently, Collections Online doesnât allow users to filter by license type, meaning that it can be hard to find content licensed under Creative Commons.There is also work to do in making it easier to download low resolution images for non-commercial use from the website.</p>
<p>Te Papa uses a BY-NC-ND copyright license as the museum charges for commercial use of its images through the Te Papa Picture Library.</p>
<p>There are also issues of moral rights, cultural rights and 'orphan works,' those works that are still under copyright but that have no obvious copyright owner. Victoria and others at Te Papa are working on addressing these issues, while respecting the rights of those who donate their collections.</p>
<p>In working towards open licensing, Te Papa joins a host of museums and art galleries from around the world. Notable examples of institutions using Creative Commons licenses include the <a href="http://www.smk.dk/en/explore-the-art/the-royal-collections/free-download-of-art-works/" target="_blank">The National Gallery of Denmark</a>, <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/" target="_blank">The National Portrait Gallery</a> in the UK, and <a href="http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/copyright.php" target="_blank">Brooklyn Museum</a> in the US. In May of this year, <a href="http://thewalters.org/news/releases/pressdetail.aspx?e_id=385" target="_blank">Walters Art Museum</a> uploaded over 19 000 openly licensed images of artworks to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Collections_of_the_Walters_Art_Museum" target="_blank">Wikimedia</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theoutlookforsomeday.net/" target="_blank">The Outlook for Someday</a> is a sustainability themed short film competition for young people. The concept is simple: âmake a short sustainability-related filmâ and keep it under five minutes.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, hundreds of young New Zealanders have entered the competition, from primary school students to university graduates.</p>
<p>Like all artists, these young people have been inspired by a range of other works, including documentaries, photos, television, books and music. As we like to say at Creative Commons -- and as Justin Cone puts it in <a href="http://creativecommons.org/videos/building-on-the-past" target="_blank">this fantastic video</a> --Â  creativity builds on the past. Until recently, however, filmmakers who wish to remix and reuse have faced a range of legal and technical barriers.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, this situation<strong> </strong>has changed. On the one hand, weâve seen the rise of digital editing software, which allows young students to edit their footage like professionals. On the other hand, there has been the spectacular growth of Creative Commons works.</p>
<p>Many young filmmakers have decided to save time and energy by remixing and reusing openly licensed and public domain materials. To do so, they are turning to sites like <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/">DigitalNZ</a> for New Zealand content; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/commons" target="_blank">Flickr</a> for photos; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/creative_commons" target="_blank">Youtube</a> for video; <a href="posts/2012/08/27/www.jamendo.com/en" target="_blank">Jamendo</a> for music; and <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikimedia </a>for content from the public domain.</p>
<p>Nathan Parker, principal of <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/08/warrington-school/" target="_blank">Warrington School </a>on the Otago coast, pointed his students to Vimeo, where students came across documentaries with Creative Commons licences. âThe students could use the footage in their own film, and give it their own interpretation,â Nathan says. âItâs just great.â</p>
<p>The supreme winners in 2011 were Susan &amp; Andrew Wardell, with their film<a href="http://www.theoutlookforsomeday.net/films/2011/029/" target="_blank"> âShopping for Our Future.â</a> The short film used a range of public domain resources to discuss the ethics of consumer culture. As the creators put it, âHow do our shopping decisions affect the world we live in? What choice do we have?â</p>

<p>After the earthquake in Canterbury, several New Zealand government agencies â following the <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_blank">NZGOAL</a> framework â released their photos, videos and data under a Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>At the time, this meant that the public could post, reuse and share the latest information about the extent of the disaster. In 2012, these resources constitute an extraordinary â and extraordinarily open â archive. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Land Information New Zealand <a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/3185-christchurch-post-earthquake-aerial-photos-24-feb-2011/?embed=1" target="_blank">released their aerial photography on the Koordinates platform</a>, which is still their most popular download.</p>

<p>The New Zealand Defence Force also released <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nzdefenceforce/sets/?&amp;page=2" target="_blank">their aerial photography</a> under a Creative Commons licence.</p>

<p>As we reported <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2011/04/post-quake-imagery-of-christchurch-carries-cc-licence/" target="_blank"> at the time</a>, Civil Defence also released footage of inner-city Christchurch under an open Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbXJJN9ZSFc]</p>
<p>After the earthquake, public institutions like the Christchurch City Library, the National Library of New Zealand and Canterbury University formed the <a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/" target="_blank">CEISMIC Consortium</a> and began to call for people who experienced the earthquake to share their stories and photos online.</p>
<p>They developed several websites, including <a href="http://www.quakestories.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Quake Stories</a> and a section of <a href="http://http://ketechristchurch.peoplesnetworknz.info/canterbury_earthquakes_2010_2011" target="_blank">Kete Christchurch</a>. Most of the stories and photos on these sites have been given a Creative Commons 3.0 New Zealand licence, to make sure the public has advance permission to share and reuse the works.</p>
<p>Most recently, the plan for the <a href="http://ccdu.govt.nz/the-plan" target="_blank">Christchurch Recover Plan</a> was published with a Creative Commons Attribution licence.</p>
