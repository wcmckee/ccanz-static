<p>In the middle of the year, we launched <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZCommons</a>, a community site for information and discussion on opening New Zealand’s culture and knowledge for sharing and reuse. As the site develops, we want it to be of use to as many communities as possible, including teachers, librarians, data users, government employees, researchers, students, artists and more.</p>
<p>To ensure that we’re meeting the needs of all these communities, we’re looking to appoint a volunteer editorial board. The editorial board will set the general direction of NZCommons and help ensure that the site is consistently publishing relevant, high quality interviews, case studies, resources, opinion pieces -- and whatever else the inaugural board thinks the site needs.</p>
<p>The board will also provide links to potential contributors, and generally help ensure that NZCommons is a lively, informative place. We're hoping that it will have representatives from all the different sectors we're looking to help.</p>
<p>The board will have the opportunity to meet remotely every two months, and will keep in touch with each other and Creative Commons staff via an email list and Loomio group. We'll use the meeting to discuss ideas for the site, the email lists to suggest potential topics and contributors and Loomio to make decisions.</p>
<p>The positions are voluntary, with a low time commitment -- though we would like the inaugural editorial board to commit to staying involved for at least twelve months.</p>
<p>If you're keen, please get in touch with Matt McGregor at matt@creativecommons.org.nz before 15 October.</p>

<h5>BY VICTORIA REA</h5>
<p>Massive Open Online Courses -- otherwise known as MOOCs. What are they? Why were they created? And how effective are they in the face of all the criticisms against them?</p>
<p>A MOOC is essentially an open course, free of charge, open to anyone with an Internet connection. MOOCs are the latest advancement in online education and distance education, and have been adopted by some of the top universities around the world.</p>
<p>MOOCs are set apart from other models of distance and online education by the scale that they manage to reach. Some courses have hundreds of thousands of enrolments. This illustrates the true potential of MOOCs for not only domestic students, but also students in the global south, where higher education may be inaccessible to the majority of the population.</p>
<h5>MOOC platforms</h5>

<p>There are a couple of main platforms that supply Massive Open Online Courses:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Edx</strong></a> is a company created by Harvard and MIT that hosts nine main courses mirroring the campus courses taught by the universities. It is currently focusing on hard sciences and mathematics. Students do not receive credit from the university.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Coursera</strong> </a>is the largest MOOC platform, with over 200 courses. Courses cover a large range of topics, from the hard sciences and math to classics, history and other humanities subjects. The courses are made up from input for academics and professors from thirty universities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Udacity</strong></a> is a middle range provider, with roughly 19 courses. One thing that sets this provider apart from the rest is that you are allowed to spend as long you want completing the courses. They also have a distinct no textbook policy.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the <a href="http://oeru.org/" target="_blank"><strong>OERu</strong></a>, coordinated by the OER Foundation. They are an independent not for profit network that offers free online courses for students worldwide. They also partner with several recognised institutions to create an affordable way for learners to gain academic credit. What is special about this platform is that it is based in Dunedin, New Zealand and is run off truly open principles. One of the founding principles of the organisation is to provide for those who are excluded from the formal education system.</p>
<h5>Kinds of MOOCs</h5>

<p>As well as the different platforms that supply MOOCs there are also broadly three different kinds of MOOCs:</p>
<p><strong>xMOOCs</strong> are usually offered in a very similar format to the traditional university model. Traditional universities especially in America, especially Ivy League universities are the driving force behind this model. Learning is primarily focused on rote learning, where there are a variety on lectures on a range of topics that can range from 3-30 minutes. There are tests and assignments that are computer graded; very little direct instructor feedback or discussion is provided.</p>
<p><strong>CMOOCs</strong> are based on a constructivist approach that views knowledge as a networked state and learning as the process of generating those networks. There is a large range of topics and themes are very broad to allow for more learner engagement in areas that they want to learn more about. Content is delivered through lecture-based videos but there is a lot more emphasis on discussion forums, conversations with other participants and feedback from experts.</p>
<p><strong>QuasiMOOCs</strong> only very broadly fit in the definition of MOOCs. These are web-based tutorials that house a large range of Open Education Resources. An example of such an organisation is the Khan Academy. These are not technically traditional courses and are more a range of loosely related educational resources that are collected together under one theme or skill.</p>
<h5>Why MOOCs?</h5>

<p>But why were MOOCs created? And what criticisms exist around their use? In essence, MOOCs are a response to the opportunities and challenges of changing technology. Education is a fundamental right enshrined in many pieces of both domestic and international legislation and multiple organisations are constantly working on being able to increase access to education and the quality of education.</p>
<p>When they were first launched, MOOCs appeared to many as a near infallible tool that could help the spread of quality education to both domestic students unable to afford higher education and excluded students in the developing world. However, MOOCs have not been without their problems or criticisms.</p>
<h5>Copyright</h5>

<p>One of the largest problems with MOOCs is the grey area surrounding copyrights. The question of who owns what content becomes very complicated, especially as there are so many different parties involved. Early examples of MOOCs used open Creative Commons licences, such as BY-NC-SA, which allows students to share, redistribute and remix the course material, as they liked so long as they licensed the new material they created in the same way.</p>
<p>What is truly scary about the copyrighting issues with MOOCs is the claims that some third party platforms have over copyright of individual intellectual property. The major three platforms claim an exclusive license to use, distribute and reproduce and modify intellectual property, including the right to use all student material for commercial purposes. This effectively claims ownership over the intellectual property from all people who are party to the courses. Interestingly, it is also these platforms that have the tightest restrictions on copyright regarding the material that they create and distribute to their members.</p>
<h5>Drop Out Rates</h5>

<p>One of the largest problems with MOOCs is the large drop out or non-completion rate. If MOOCs were used for the purpose of specifically gaining a qualification or recognition of completion of a topic, then it would make sense to judge their success on the basis of drop out rates.</p>
<p>However, research shows that there is a large range of reasons that people enroll in MOOCs – some of which is purely interest based, which means that the completion of that course is not necessarily what they are aiming towards. Dropouts rates will obviously become more or an issue where institutions consider providing course credit to a MOOC participants.</p>
<h5>Sustainability</h5>

<p>MOOCs are free – so how will they be sustainable? Third party platforms that host these courses need to get their funding from somewhere; without additional funding, it will become harder for them to host the same kind of free courses that they currently do. The idea of introducing fees has been floated. However, this would remove one of the most fundamental aspects of MOOCs: that they are free and therefore accessible.</p>
<h5>Should we endorse MOOCs?</h5>

<p>All this discussion brings us back to the question that in the pursuit of open education are the innovations such as MOOCs really open and something we should endorse? In their title, MOOCs claim to be open; at present, though, it is clear that most MOOCS are not as open as they might initially appear.</p>
<p>It is still unclear whether MOOCs are just the educational buzzword of the moment or whether they will become a sustainable and effective method of delivering education. But it is certain that there are still a number of issues and criticisms for them to overcome before they are reflective of the principles of truly open education.</p>

<h5>BY MATT MCGREGOR</h5>
<p>In May, Mikael Laakso from Hanken School of Economics in Finland <a href="http://www.openaccesspublishing.org/green1/Lakso2014-GreenOAPoliciesAcceptedVersion.pdf" target="_blank">published research on the hundred largest journal publishers</a> for 2010. He concluded that, of the 1.1 million articles included in his study, 80.4% could have been made open access <a title="Institutional Repositories 101" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/institutional-repositories-101/">via an institutional repository</a> one year after the date of publication.</p>
<p>The key words here are ‘could have.’ Other studies cited by Laakso concluded that only 12% of research articles actually end up getting deposited -- which means that the majority of published research articles remain closed <i>despite</i> publisher policy allowing them to become open. One of the clear and present opportunities for open access to research, then, is to close this gap, and ensure that every possible piece of research that can be made open <em>is </em>made open, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The best way to do this is for research institutions and funders to adopt a strong open access policy, requiring researchers to deposit their work for archiving in their institutional repository. Such policies have been adopted by hundreds of institutions around the world -- including the University of Waikato, which <a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/news-events/media/2014/03university-of-waikato-approves-open-access-mandate-guidelines.shtml" target="_blank">adopted a deposit mandate</a> (a ‘green’ policy, for those who know the OA colour scheme) earlier this year.</p>
<p>The University of Waikato mandates that “all refereed research articles and conference papers published in refereed proceedings should be submitted for deposit in the Research Commons.”</p>
<p>This realises the principle, expressed at the top of the policy, that “Freedom to exchange ideas and to publish acquired knowledge are fundamental to the purposes of a university. The motto of the University of Waikato, “Ko Te Tangata - For the People”, embodies its commitment to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible.”</p>
<p>More recently, the <a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/year/2014/201407/#d.en.86771" target="_blank">Higher Education Funding Council for England mandated</a> that all funded research outputs “must have been deposited in an institutional repository, a repository service shared between multiple institutions, or a subject repository such as arXiv…as soon after the point of acceptance as possible.” Their mandate also states that embargo periods for funded works can not exceed either twelve or twenty-four months (depending on the discipline).</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Pynekingslibrarybuckinghamhouse_edited.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-362" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Pynekingslibrarybuckinghamhouse_edited.jpg" alt="Kings Library at Buckingham House Pyne's Royal Residences . Via Wikimedia Commons" width="564" height="471"></a> Kings Library at Buckingham House, from Pyne's <em>Royal Residences</em> . <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pynekingslibrarybuckinghamhouse_edited.jpg" target="_blank">Via Wikimedia Commons</a>. No known copyright.</p>
<p>But what about the publisher? According to <a href="http://www.openoasis.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=552&amp;Itemid=375" target="_blank">Open Oasis</a>, “95% of journals registered in <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo.php">SHERPA</a> permit self-archiving in some form.” Most of the time, the publisher allows the researcher to archive the postprint in an institutional repository; sometimes, the publisher only allows arching of the the preprint. In a fraction of cases, the publisher will allow neither -- but <a href="http://www.eprints.org/openaccess/self-faq/#publisher-forbids" target="_blank">as Eprints points out</a>, the researcher retains copyright to the preprint, this is an issue of journal policy , and it is up to researchers as to whether they choose to comply.</p>
<p>(A preprint is the version initially submitted by the author, a postprint is the version accepted by the publisher, with corrections and the published article is the typeset and publisher branded PDF).</p>
<p>Some publishers also require the archived work to be embargoed -- that is, they require the work to be closed from public access -- for a time that varies from publisher to publisher. If this is the case, then the library can ensure that the work is closed access for whichever period the publisher and/or funder has mandated -- usually six, twelve or twenty-four months. After that period, the library will happily remove the embargo on behalf of the researcher, and make it accessible to the world.</p>
<p>So, researchers: The simplest thing to do is get your accepted, refereed draft into your Institutional Repository -- immediately. As more institutions and funders adopt green OA, you’ll be well positioned to meet their requirements; you’ll also have many, many more potential readers.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that If you want to maximise the social benefits of your research, you should also make it openly licensed, as this will enable it to be copied for teaching purposes, translated, republished for other audiences -- and not locked under 'All Rights Reserved' for the life of the author plus fifty years.</p>

<h5 style="color: #222222;"><strong>BY DARUSHA WEHM<i></i></strong></h5>
<p style="color: #222222;">As a fiction author, the most important aspect of my business is finding and keeping readers. I want to reduce the barriers between my work and potential readers, so a few years ago, I conducted a survey about book reading and buying habits. One of the questions I asked people was what they would change about getting books. This comment really hit home:</p>

<p style="color: #222222;">“No DRM. Absolutely none. If eBooks have DRM then I pirate them simply to have them without DRM.”</p>

<p style="color: #222222;">I agree that, as a reader, DRM is a non-starter for me as well, though there are solutions other than piracy*. But what the heck is DRM, anyway, and how does it affect publishers and authors?</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://static.fsf.org/dbd/label/DRM-free%20label%20120.en.png" alt=""></p>
<p style="color: #222222;">DRM stands for Digital Rights Management, which is a way of locking digital goods. DRM is why most Kindle books can’t be read on a Kobo reader. The problem with DRM, of course, is exactly that: if I buy a book from the Sony Reader store, then decide I want to read that book on Stanza on my iPod, too bad for me. Even though it’s my book. As both a reader and an author, this is a barrier.</p>

<p style="color: #222222;">Some books from the major ebookstores are sold without DRM and can be converted into other formats. Most, however, are locked unless you remove the DRM (be aware – doing this may be not be considered legal in New Zealand, even if you own the book and are converting it only for your personal use).</p>

<p style="color: #222222;">I believe that DRM makes digital goods less than fully functional, and I can’t in good conscience sell a defective product. I don’t want DRM in the books I buy, so I don’t sell books with DRM in them.</p>

<p style="color: #222222;">Yes, that means it’s possible for you to give your friend a copy of my book. Yes, that’s theoretically a lost sale for me. But it’s also a possible new reader. So, if you want to give one of my books to someone you think would like it, go ahead. That doesn’t mean uploading the files to P2P sites, but passing on a beloved book to a fellow reader is a long and wonderful tradition among book lovers.</p>

<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is looking for casual workshop facilitators based in Auckland, Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin.</p>
<p>Creative Commons is helping to roll out open policy to every school, research and heritage institution in New Zealand -- but to do this, we’re going to need some help.</p>
<p>We’re looking for confident, articulate candidates who can commit to providing one to two workshops per month. Successful candidates will be paid a standard rate of $100 per workshop provided, though should note that this work is very casual, and will depend on local demand.</p>
<p>These positions won’t pay the rent, but they're a great opportunity to help grow the Commons in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>Candidates should have their own form of transport, or be able to get around their home city to local schools, research and heritage institutions.</p>
<p>We’ll provide some training and all the materials you’ll need, though a working knowledge of copyright and Creative Commons is desirable. You should also have some public speaking experience.</p>
<p>We’re also building a pool of (unfortunately unpaid) volunteers who can commit to providing a workshop or writing for our community site, NZCommons.org.nz, every two or three months. If you’re keen to volunteer, let us know on your application.</p>
<p>Please send us a short CV and a quick cover letter outlining your interest in helping out CC.</p>
<p>We’re looking for facilitators based in Auckland, Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin. Applicants based in other regions are welcome to apply, though should note there is unlikely to be much work available outside of the main centres.</p>
<p>Applications close 8 October 2014.</p>

<p></p>
<h5>BY AMANDA CURNOW</h5>
<p>This is a very basic introductory post on institutional repositories and how they facilitate Open Access (OA).</p>
<h5>What is an institutional repository?</h5>

<p>An institutional repository (IR) is basically an online collection of an institution’s research. It may contain theses, articles, conference papers, creative works, grey literature and more. Wikipedia defines an institutional repository as “<span lang="en">an online archive for collecting, preserving, and disseminating digital copies of the intellectual output of an institution, particularly a research institution” (</span><span lang="en">Institutional repository,</span><span lang="en"> 2014).</span></p>
<h5>Why they were set up?</h5>

<p>Institutional repositories were created in response to exorbitant increases in journal subscription charges -- often called the “Serials Crisis” (Serials Crisis, 2014). According to White and Creaser (2007), between 2000 and 2006 the median journal subscription price increased between 42% and 104%.</p>
<p>As one letter to The Guardian noted, “Scholarly publishing is the only industry that gets its raw materials free of charge and then sells them (highly priced) back to the institutions that provide them” (Open access plan is no academic spring, 2012). Institutional repositories are also a response to the dissatisfaction among scholars for the time delays in circulating the results of research via traditional publishing methods (Cullen &amp; Chawner, 2011).</p>
<h5>What they do?</h5>

<p>The goal of an IR is to create greater discoverability of, and access to, the intellectual product in a single portal, ultimately increasing the impact of the research. It also has the flow-on effect of raising the profile of individual researchers and the university/research institution itself. Institutional repositories typically provide access to the full text of research outputs, without the need for expensive subscriptions to journals.</p>
<p>The best repositories conform to the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), allowing them to be indexed by search engines such as Google and other aggregators, like OCLC’s OAIster and Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE) so that the content can be easily discovered (Suber, 2012).</p>
<h5>How they can help facilitate Open Access?</h5>

<p>Institutional repositories can help facilitate Open Access by providing free online access to the full text of a research output for anyone with an internet connection, whether it is an article, conference paper or other work.</p>
<p>For an article or conference paper, the full text may be one of several different versions produced during the lifecycle of the scholarly process: a submitted manuscript, which is the author’s draft; an accepted version, which is an amended, peer-reviewed version; or the publisher’s version, which is the accepted version fully formatted. (For more information on article versions see the <a href="http://www.library.aut.ac.nz/?a=124795">New Zealand Version Toolkit</a>.)</p>
<p>This form of open access is called ‘green’ open access and occurs when the author self-archives the output. As Peter Suber puts it, "the OA movement uses the term […] green OA for OA delivered by repositories. Self-archiving is the practice of depositing one’s own work in an OA repository. All three of these terms were coined by Stevan Harnad” (Suber, 2012, p. 53).</p>
<p>Self-archiving is a passive act of making research outputs available after the research has been traditionally published; it complements the traditional publishing system. In order to ensure copyright is not infringed, the <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">Sherpa/Romeo</a> website can be used to identify many journal publishers’ copyright policies. The policies state which version may be deposited and under what conditions. Typical conditions include a set statement, embargo period and link to publisher’s version or website.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://roar.eprints.org/">Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR)</a> provides information about OA repositories globally. There is also a graphical map representation of OA repositories at <a href="http://maps.repository66.org/">Repository66</a>.</p>
<h5>Institutional Repositories in New Zealand</h5>

<p>New Zealand universities followed the example of their international counterparts and set up institutional repositories during the 2000s, as did some polytechnics. Each repository typically includes research outputs from current staff and post-graduate students, as well as recently completed theses.</p>
<p>Most of the universities have done some sort of retrospective digitisation of doctoral and/or masters theses. However, each institution varies in what is publicly accessible due to copyright restrictions and authorial permissions.</p>
<p>The content in the eight New Zealand university research repositories is aggregated by <a href="http://nzresearch.org.nz/">NZResearch.org.nz</a>, which is run by the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa. The individual university repositories’ sites can be found at the following links:</p>

</ul>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">These repositories are critical for the dissemination of research by Kiwi researchers about New Zealand. Some are continuing to advance the cause through recently approved mandates to deposit (see Waikato University's <a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz/open-access/%20" target="_blank">Open Access Policy</a>).</p>

CC-BY.</p>
<p>In November 2013, Creative Commons released its ‘4.0 licences’, an updated version of the Creative Commons licences that were intended to be both more plain English and more international. In CC-speak, this meant that the licences would not need to be ‘ported’ to specific jurisdictions. Prior the release of 4.0, the process of porting had been a fundamental part of CC’s work, with dozens of countries all over the world re-drafting the licences to meet the quirks of their own individual legal systems.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons 3.0 licences were ported to New Zealand law in 2007 by Andrew Matangi, a consultant with the law firm Buddle Findlay. Andrew was approached to help draft the  licences after being approached by a colleague and asked if “he wanted to do something for free." The colleague’s father happened to be Brian Opie, the then Executive Director of the Council for the Humanities, who had recognised a growing need for CC licensing across the education, research and heritage sectors.</p>
<p>Andrew began drafting the New Zealand licences by having a look at the American English language licences. He quickly decided that their approach wasn’t suitable for New Zealand. “They needed to be far more plain English. These licences are very public facing -- much more so than most legal documents. More members of the public than lawyers will be reading them.”</p>
<p>Rather than start from scratch, Andrew contacted a team in the UK, who had similar reservations about the American licences. “They had already put in a huge amount of work to develop a plain English licence. I leveraged off the UK versions and revised them to meet a few peculiarities of New Zealand law. There are a few Americanisms in the Creative Commons licences, which I tried to get away from, such as references to client and attorney relationships -- that sort of thing. I also tried to avoid some of the repetition that was in the existing licences.”</p>
<p>Andrew also had to take into account New Zealand-specific legislation, like the Consumer Guarantees Act, which the licenses needed to contract out of. “From there, we went back and forth with the legal team at CCHQ, which was a very easy process. They were welcoming of the move to plain English licences, which is the way more and more legal documents are moving these days.’”</p>
<p>After the New Zealand licences were launched in 2008, the State Services Commission recommended that they be used by the New Zealand Government; in 2010, Cabinet approved government use of the CC licences with the NZ Government Open Access and Licensing framework (NZGOAL). The fact that the licences were ported to New Zealand law proved to be a key motivation for the Government to take up the licences.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that they clarify which country’s law will apply, should a case involving CC licensing ever go to court. Under international law, this is not always obvious, especially when a work is reused online -- Andrew gives the example of a New Zealand work that is used by someone in Korea on a website hosted in the United States. The Creative Commons NZ 3.0 licences cut through this complexity, ensuring that it will always be New Zealand law that applies, should the work be shared and reused overseas.</p>
<p>As Andrew points out, “A big part of contract drafting is ‘no surprises’; it should be clear what everyone’s obligations are and what happens should the contract be breached. With intellectual property, it’s always best to put in black and white what the position is.”</p>
<p>Creative Commons licences also take into account legal liability, should anything go wrong after someone reuses a work. At a Creative Commons in Schools event in February, Andrew used the example of a CC licensed science experiment that caused injury or damage: under the terms of the 3.0 New Zealand licence, the creator of the experiment would not be liable “on any legal basis...for loss or damage.”</p>
<p>Since drafting the 3.0 New Zealand licences, Andrew has been contributing to the development of the international 4.0 licences, which were released in November last year. The 4.0 licences follow the lead of the UK, New Zealand and Australian licences by incorporating more plain English language. As Andrew explains, “The licences are much longer, as international licenses have to deal with many more issues. But they are a vast improvement on the very legalistic 3.0 licences.”</p>
<p>“The 4.0 licences were written with the goal of not being ported to specific jurisdictions. They were trying to get away from references to specific jurisdiction’s laws on the licences, so that intergovernmental organisations like the UN and The World Bank would be comfortable with using them.”</p>

<h5>BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE</h5>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/09/EH-Image.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-346" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/09/EH-Image.jpg" alt="EH Image" width="594" height="171"></a></p>
<p>I am of the generation that has grown up with a vastly changing copyright environment, and my ideas about ownership, sharing, rights, intellectual property, theft and fair use have developed - are developing - accordingly. As I’m the new Comms Lead for Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ, I wanted to use this post to introduce myself and my ideas, particularly - as I’m also a freelance publisher - around books.</p>
<p>As a lifelong consumer of creative media, my attitude to copyright has become a desire to do the right thing (i.e. support artists) tempered by a sort of frustrated pragmatism. For example, I can’t play the DVDs I’ve hired in NZ on my Playstation because I brought it back from the UK with me and it’s region-locked. So I have to rip illegal copies of films I’ve legally hired in order to watch them in my own home. And I’ve more or less given up watching actual television: partly because I want to choose what I watch from around the world, and partly because the energy I’m willing to devote to dancing round the various restrictions only goes so far.</p>
<p>I always try to keep in mind my experience as a consumer when navigating copyright in my professional life as a publisher. On the one hand, publishers and authors need to be able to make a living from books, otherwise there will be fewer (less interesting, less diverse) books and, I firmly believe, human cultural development will suffer. So there needs to be some kind of financial transaction. With books made from paper, this is very easy. We already have an international infrastructure of sales, distribution and bookshops that is essentially one giant paywall between publishers and readers. (Even when you get a book out from the library, the author still gets a cut.) But what about ebooks?</p>
<p>What to do about ebooks is a conversation I am constantly having with publishing colleagues around the world. How to best make them, whether to attach digital padlocks (in the form of digital rights/restrictions management, or DRM), how to market and publicise them, and of course, what the hell to do about that giant book-gobbling monolith, Amazon.com.</p>
<p>An interesting idea that keeps coming up is that piracy is the new publicity. (I really like the rakish “piracy”, sounds so much more dashing and romantic than “copyright infringement”.) Anecdotes abound wherein heavily pirated ebook titles have coincided with (caused?) inflated sales, both print and digital. This is all part of one of the fundamental truths of publishing: word of mouth sells books. Traditionally, publishers have tried to stimulate this by giving free copies to certain influential people (reviewers, journalists). Now, in addition to this, some publishers are trying limited zero-pricing, eg. whereby an ebook is free for a day or a week, then goes back up to its normal price.</p>
<p>Another thing I keep hearing is that publishers have to get better at communicating to readers the value that publishers add (in terms of editing, book design, sales and marketing infrastructure etc). This is to combat the big lesson that Amazon.com is teaching readers, i.e. that ebooks are only worth a couple of dollars. Well, maybe. It is true that publishing as a profession is enormously valuable, and it is also true that ebooks cost a lot more than 99 cents to produce. But is that the readers’ problem?</p>
<p>This disconnect is partly because, although the words inside may be the same, an ebook is fundamentally a different thing from a paper book. When you buy a paper book, you’re purchasing a stable, singular, physical object with a very clear ownership status. The book was in the shop, you bought it, that particular copy is now yours. Perhaps you will bend a few corners of pages back, or get your copy signed by the author, thus rendering your copy physically distinct from others. Your book-as-tangible-object will be unaffected by which electronic devices you own, which media platforms you patronise, how the Amazon vs Hachette battle plays out, and how well you back up your data. No malware in the world can touch it. Your paper book feels steady, feels valuable.</p>
<p>An ebook feels completely different. For a start - and this is especially true for books marked with DRM - purchasing an ebook feels much more like purchasing a licence to read a particular work, rather than buying an instance of the work itself. It’s also a lot more fiddly: you have to make sure that you get the right kind of file for the right kind of device. Often you find yourself unable to transfer your ebook from one of your devices to another, even though they all belong to you. And even if the ebook file works now, it’s vulnerable to future technological developments rendering it unreadable, possibly quite soon. Ebooks feel almost like a rental - temporary, with less commitment. Less valuable. No wonder we think they ought be cheap, even free.</p>
<p>And DRM - part of publishers’ doomed attempt to assert a paper-based copyright model in the face of the digital age - turns out to just be a giant pain. All it does is create irritating hitches, like my Playstation being unable to play local DVDs. DRM ebooks are much more difficult to share, which directly affects the power of word-of-mouth marketing. How will your friends know how wonderful your new favourite novel is if you can’t lend it to them? We have the big lesson of the music industry staring us in the face: the easier you can make electronic creations to purchase, the more consumers will be inclined to buy rather than steal them.</p>
<p>So where does this leave us? How can we strike a balance between ensuring that books reach the widest possible audience while maintaining an economically viable creative industry that supports authors and publishers?</p>
<p>I still think that the traditional copyright model is best for paper books: that still feels fair (except I think copyright should die when the creator does). But I believe that paper and digital are sufficiently different that ebooks - even electronic versions of the same title - require a different approach. They need to be sold differently, marketed differently, stored and distributed differently. Their copyright needs to be managed much more openly, with a focus on attracting readers through ease of sharing, rather than the punitive, adversarial approach of DRM.</p>
<p>No one can stop readers pirating ebooks. That option is off the table. Instead, it is publishers’ and booksellers’ responsibility to make high-quality, legitimately purchased, easy-to-share ebooks easier and more pleasant to access than pirated copies. I don’t know yet exactly how we’re going to do this, so please do chip in with your own ideas. But I have faith that somehow the publishing industry can make it happen. If you book them, they will come.</p>
