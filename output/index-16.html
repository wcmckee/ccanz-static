<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is proud to announce <a href="http://mixandmash.org.nz/showcase" target="_blank">the winners of the first showcase of Mix &amp; Mash 2013</a>, New Zealand’s great remix competition!</p>
<p>The open award has been won by Sadaf Lourie, Riccardo Scott, Jarred Bishop and Alex Gibson for ‘What Happened?’, an interactive children’s story. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mix_brown_rgb.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3364" title="mix_brown_rgb" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mix_brown_rgb.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="169"></a></p>
<p>Our judges commended ‘What Happened?’ for its "outstanding illustrations” and described it as "a lovely concept that works on, quite literally, several levels, with a sweet, slightly goose-bumpy ending."</p>
<p>The student award has been taken out by Travis, Evan and Jared Manning (aged 11, 9 and 6). Using stop motion animation, poetry, story writing and drawing, their video tells ‘The Story of Rangitoto.’</p>
<p>Our judges praised the story as “a dramatic and exciting retelling of the origins of a familiar piece of the Auckland landscape."</p>
<p>Both entries will receive $500 in prizes, thanks to sponsors <a href="http://www.orcon.net.nz/" target="_blank">Orcon</a> and <a href="http://www.copyright.co.nz/" target="_blank">Copyright Licensing New Zealand</a> and our Mix &amp; Mash partner, the <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Ministry of Education</a>.</p>
<p>Ten entries in total were selected by judges for the May Showcase, and can be viewed at mixandmash.org.nz/showcase</p>
<p>All entries will be considered for the $2000 Mix &amp; Mash Supreme Awards at the end of the year, sponsored by <a href="http://www.squiz.net/nz">Squiz</a> and supported by the <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/">National Library of New Zealand</a> and the <a href="http://www.nzta.govt.nz/">New Zealand Transport Agency</a>.</p>
<p>Mix &amp; Mash would like to thank our May Showcase judges Mark Osborne (Core Education), Jolisa Gracewood (writer for The Listener) and Dan Mills (Creative Commons).</p>
<p>Organised by Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a> and the <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank">National Library of New Zealand</a> and enabled by a range of sponsors and partners, Mix &amp; Mash 2013 celebrates the creative reuse of data and content from New Zealand’s rich cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Keen to enter? Mix &amp; Mash wants all New Zealanders, young and old, to tell new stories by adapting and remixing public domain or openly licensed content and data.</p>
<p>Entries for the August Showcase are now open, with prizes provided by sponsors and partners <a href="posts/2013/05/31/Copyright%20Licensing%20New%20Zealand" target="_blank">Copyright Licensing New Zealand</a>, <a href="http://www.niwa.co.nz/" target="_blank">NIWA</a> and the <a href="http://www.minedu.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Ministry of Education</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As many of you may know, <a href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/About/Library-Staff/Staff-Profile/?StaffID=Penny.Carnaby" target="_blank">Penny Carnaby</a> has Chaired the <a title="Who We Are" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/about/who-we-are/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand Advisory Panel</a> since its inception in August 2010. After nearly three years at the helm of the CCANZ Panel, Penny recently decided to step down as Chair.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Penny has been—and continues to be—a tireless champion of open access and open licensing in Aotearoa New Zealand. As Chief Executive at the National Library of New Zealand, Penny supported Brian Opie, Winston Roberts,  Paul Reynolds and all the others working to launch the Creative Commons project in Aotearoa NZ.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When CCANZ was adopted by the <a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/" target="_blank">Royal Society of New Zealand</a>, Penny volunteered to Chair its Advisory Panel, and has done a remarkable job guiding the project ever since.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At her current role as University Librarian and Professor of Digital Knowledge Systems at Lincoln University, Penny continues to work for open access and open licensing for publicly funded research.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On behalf of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, I’d like to thank Penny for all her hard work!</p>

<p>Jane Hornibrook, who worked closely with Penny as CCANZ Public Lead from 2010-2012, also wanted to thank Penny for “sharing so much time and support for birth and development of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand. We’ve been lucky to have such a passionate and enthusiastic leader on our team.”</p>

<a href="http://www.wikihouse.cc/" target="_blank">WikiHouse</a> is an ambitious global open hardware project that aims to “allow anyone to design, download and ‘print’ CNC-milled houses and components, which can be assembled with minimal formal skill or training.”
<p><a href="http://thinkradical.net/" target="_blank">New Zealand’s WikiHouse Lab</a> was formed by Martin Luff and Danny Squires, who discovered the idea after the second <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Christchurch_earthquake" target="_blank">Canterbury earthquake</a> in February 2011. As Martin puts it, “Danny and myself were trying to find a solution to a whole number of different issues in the built environment. We spent about six months researching different systems. During that process, a friend tipped us off to the WikiHouse project.”</p>
<p>After the Canterbury earthquakes, over 6100 businesses were displaced from the central city. “Only about ten of those have gone back to their original location,” Martin says. “The rest needed to relocate somewhere else. We were looking for a system whereby, in the worst case scenario, within a few weeks you could relocate your business and be back up in running.”</p>
<p>Martin and Danny were also keen to empower the local community. “A lot of people down here in Canterbury are stuck in limbo because they are dependent on a whole hierarchy of other agencies before they can get on with things like repairs and replacement housing.</p>
<p>“One particular thing we were looking for was a system that allowed people to be involved right from the get-go, through the whole design process, right the way to implementation. One of the really nice things about WikiHouse is that the people can really assemble the things on the ground themselves, as well being involved in the whole design process along the way. One of the main things we looking at was empowerment.”</p>
<p>As Martin explains, WikiHouse could also make housing more affordable. With WikiHouse, young people looking to enter the housing market would be able to start small, and be able to expand when they need to. Parents with large houses would also be able to break off sections of their house, to pass on to their children as a ‘starter-kit’—a form of “hand-me-down housing.”</p>
<p>Martin and Danny also wanted to ensure that what they produced was healthier, stronger and more environmentally friendly than the current housing stock. “We wanted it to be world-class in terms of its ability to stand up to seismic resistance. We also wanted it, longer-term, to go beyond sustainability to something that could be restorative to our environment.”</p>
<p>Creative Commons licensing is a core part of WikiHouse. As Martin explains, “Creative Commons is essential to the whole WikiHouse project. There are <a href="http://www.wikihouse.cc/guide" target="_blank">ten core principles</a>, and principle number one is be lazy like a fox. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Copy, adapt, give credit and share.”</p>
<p>Creative Commons licensing enables WikiHouse teams from around the world to collaborate and improve on each other’s designs. By way of example, Martin explains that the initial WikiHouse design “had a lot of mechanical fixings in it. A collective design effort quickly eliminated the need for those. The system we’ve got at the moment can be put together without power tools, by unskilled people in a very short length of time. There are no mechanical fixings in it, no bolts or screws or glue.”</p>
<p>Going forward, Martin sees WikiHouse taking off through a series of local projects, “probably neighbourhood based manufacturing plants, where local people can drop in, not just to build buildings, but all sorts of other things as well.” This global network of community-based organisations is where Creative Commons licensing becomes important.</p>
<p>“We really see this as a social enterprise, and it’s only going to work if we can deliver on scale—very large scale. One of the workshops we’re setting up in the WikiHouse project is in Rio. The global perspective on the project is that in the next 40 to 50 years, if the projections hold true, then we’ve got to built as much urban development globally as currently is in existence. This is mind-boggling. We can’t do that with conventional building techniques or without openly working together on solutions.”</p>
<p>In 2012, WikiHouse Rio won part of the <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2013/02/27/8-great-ideas-for-cities-the-city-2-0-award-winners-in-video/" target="_blank">TED City Prize 2.0</a>, for its project setting up an “open source maker lab in the heart of the <em>favela</em>.” With its Creative Commons licence, this project could potentially be duplicated—and improved—in other cities around the world.</p>
<p>“As I see it, if you’re shutting away that information, the things that you learn, then it’s essentially a waste-stream. It seems critical that, as far as possible, you’re open. If you take the bigger picture, it can seem a bit petty to fence that knowledge away, and charge people to access it; especially since any new idea only ever builds incrementally on all the knowledge and wisdom that went before. Creative Commons seems like a great way to acknowledge that.”</p>
<p>Open source hardware, however, is still a new concept, especially for highly-regulated industries like construction. “It’s much trickier to get the globally distributed network right, especially when it’s a mix of professionals and amateurs.”</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Danny and Martin, along with the founding WikiHouse team in the UK, are looking to have a finished house by the end of the year. “That’s one of the beauties of a large, open source project: It’s surprising how quickly it can progress.”</p>

<h5>By Matt McGregor</h5>
<p>In June 2012, Youtube user ‘gloveandboots’ released ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9zSfinwFA" target="_blank">The Vertical Video Syndrome – A PSA</a>,’ a video poking fun at film-makers who hold their camera-phone vertically. Common across Youtube, videos shot vertically have two black bands of empty space framing the video, as you can see the screenshot, below.</p>
<p>The Vertical Video Syndrome quickly went viral, picking up over three million views on Youtube. Noticing the popularity of the video, <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/seftms/about/staff/miriam-ross" target="_blank">Miriam Ross</a>—an academic and filmmaker based in Wellington, New Zealand—decided to respond. With research assistant Maddy Glen, Miriam produced the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buHSJitp46w" target="_blank">Vertical Cinema Manifesto</a>, arguing that Vertical Cinema was, in fact, a legitimate cinematic form.</p>
<p>As Miriam explains, “The ‘Vertical Video Syndrome was very humorous, but when you see it getting circulated online, it’s used as a form of policing.</p>
<p>“We wanted to get away from that. We wanted to say, we have all these new tools, let’s see what can happen. It’s all very experimental. Hopefully the manifesto is a celebration of what can be done.”</p>
<p>The result was a close parody of the Vertical Cinema Syndrome. Replete with quotes from feminist film scholar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Mulvey" target="_blank">Laura Mulvey</a>,The result was a close parody of the Vertical Cinema Syndrome. Replete with quotes from feminist film scholar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Mulvey" target="_blank">Laura Mulvey</a>, the film closes with six recommendations, the forth of which reads, "A Creative Commons licence must be used."</p>
<p>The ideas around the manifesto tied into an honours film course Miriam was teaching at the time, on DIY filmmaking. “That paper framed the project. Part of that is trying to move away from the hierarchies around filmmaking--the idea that there’s a ‘best way’ to make films.</p>
<p>“We were looking at how people use the technology they have in their hands to make films with no budget or resources. Obviously, with DIY filmmaking the Creative Commons licences became very interesting. It tied into both the courses I teach and our project. Because we’ve got no money, we’ve been wanting to find material we can use for free. But we also want to take part in this Creative Commons culture that’s going round now, where people are licensing their work for free.”</p>
<p>Miriam is also interested in how DIY filmmakers remix and reuse other cultural works. As she points out, “There’s a lot of debate now, because video essays are becoming more popular. Film academics who are using video clips, and sometimes using voiceover to narrate the clips, and that’s could come up against copyright.”</p>
<p>As Miriam points out, one of the problems is that New Zealand lacks the broad Fair Use allowances enjoyed in the US. Even the Vertical Cinema Manifesto itself, which uses small parts of several copyright films, could occupy a grey area, despite <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345961.html" target="_blank">New Zealand’s Fair Dealing exceptions for criticism and review</a>.</p>
<p>“It is tricky. One of the things I teach in my course is mashups and video remixes. They are a huge part of our contemporary culture, and they’re all operating in this grey area. It’s strange because the companies, especially film companies, want their films talked about. The mashups are often a form of advertising for them, but they still aren’t promoting this sort of use.”</p>
<p>More recently, Miriam and Maddy produced Heaven, a short ‘vertical’ film currently under consideration for film festivals. “It’s an exploration of what we can do with very little resources and money, using new technologies.”</p>
<p>This film, like the Manifesto itself, was made collaboratively with friends and colleagues, and will carry a Creative Commons licence when released.</p>
<p>“That’s what’s great about Creative Commons. It encourages people to take something and just see what they can do with it. That’s the kind of spirit I want to see more of. Instead of trying to be an auteur starting from scratch to make something unique and singular, why not build on what other people are doing to create something that’s maybe more hybrid, but maybe more exciting as a result.”</p>

This image is made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives licence</a>.
<p>Meena Kadri is a Wellington-based photographer, designer and Community Manager for <a href="http://www.openideo.com/profiles/meanestindian/" target="_blank">OpenIDEO</a>, a collaborative innovation and design platform.</p>
<p>A long-time user of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> (under the name Meanest Indian), Meena releases many of her photos under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives licence</a>.  Her CC-licensed images have appeared in a variety of newspapers, magazines, blogs and books, and have been licensed for commercial use by companies like <a href="http://au.phaidon.com/agenda/" target="_blank">Phaidon</a> and Apple.</p>
<p>Despite this success, Meena confesses that she “never actually intended to sell my photos—I just wanted to put them online. But pretty soon I realised the potential.”</p>
<p>While teaching at India’s <a href="http://www.nid.edu/" target="_blank">National Institute of Design</a> in the mid 2000s, Meena started using Flickr  to source high-quality images for her presentations; by 2006, she was using Flickr to share her own photos. “Flickr was the first social network I’d ever used. I realised pretty quickly how to optimise traffic to my site using tags, especially because I was taking photos of events  that were both in demand but under-photographed, such as the Uttarayan Kite Festival in India. It didn’t take long to get my photos on the front page of Flickr image search for certain topics.”</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Meena-Photo1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3769" title="Meena Photo1" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Meena-Photo1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/106356459/in/set-72057594114388846/" target="_blank">Ripe'</a> by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/sets/?&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Meena Kadri/Meanest Indian</a>, via Flickr. This image is made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives licence</a>.</p>
<p>Her most popular set of photos--on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/sets/72157594478128903/" target="_blank">Uttarayan Kite Festival, India</a>--has received over 50,000 views. Other popular sets include <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/sets/72157594428155937/" target="_blank">Indian Street Art</a> (over 40,000 views), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/sets/72057594094242130/" target="_blank">Back View Bollywood</a> (nearly 25,000 views) and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/sets/72057594079156428/" target="_blank">Faces of India</a> (over 19,000 views).</p>
<p>Given the popularity of her Flickr account, her images have featured in countless blogs and presentations. For-profit companies have also paid to use her work, including Serendib, the magazine of Sri Lankan Airlines, and Phaidon Books, who included ten of her images in an Indian cookbook. As Meena explains, “what I usually do in these situations is negotiate. For those people with little or no money, such as NGOs, I usually say go for it. For others, I ask, ‘are you getting paid?’ The implication is that if they are getting paid, then I should be getting paid as well. For them, I charge my standard rate.”</p>
<p>Recently, Meena even licensed one of her Creative Commons licensed photos to Apple, her biggest sale so far. At the same time, Meena ensures that images sold to for-profit companies like Apple and Phaidon remain available for reuse under their original non-commercial Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>As Meena’s images grew in popularity, she experimented with using Getty, a stock image service. While she made a small amount of money from the service, Meena “didn’t like that they required you to use All Rights Reserved. I tried it, because they do move a lot of images, but in the end I decided that I preferred using Creative Commons on Flickr.”</p>
<p>One reason for this is that Creative Commons licences require attribution, which is not the case with stock image services like Getty. As Meena explains, “The Creative Commons licences means that I receive a lot of traffic from having lots of sites—from major technology blogs like Wired to smaller community blogs with loyal followers—link back to my Flickr page."</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Backview-Bollywood-Meena.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3781" title="Backview Bollywood Meena" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Backview-Bollywood-Meena.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="362"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/119371646/in/set-72057594094242130/" target="_blank">'Backview Bollywood #7'</a> by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meanestindian/sets/?&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Meena Kadri/Meanest Indian</a>, via Flickr. This image is made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives licence</a>.</p>
<p>While Meena is keen to emphasise that the upsides of using Creative Commons licensing greatly outweigh the downsides, she has noticed her images being used without proper attribution. “Every now and then, I’ll find unattributed images and send a nice email asking for attribution. It’s important to be nice, as a lot of people genuinely don’t know how the licences works. I tend to assume it’s a mistake, and send them a link to the licence page.”</p>
<p>Other uses have been more problematic. While visiting her father’s hometown in India, Meena opened a major local newspaper to find one of her images used—for commercial purposes and without attribution—to advertise the upcoming Kite Festival. Meena got in touch with the newspaper, pointed out that they did not have a licence for commercial reuse, and was eventually paid her standard rate.</p>
<p>To prevent unlicensed commercial reuse, Meena only puts web-quality images on her Flickr page. This means that her images are good enough for blogs or slideshow presentations; those wanting to use her images for books or posters, however, will need to ask for a higher resolution.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=meanest+indian&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;authuser=0&amp;ei=JM6JUcbmM4ewkAXg1oDACQ&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=868&amp;sei=J86JUcbyIcH0kQXirIH4BA" target="_blank">Google Image search for 'Meanest Indian'</a> reveals, Meena's CC-licensed photos are being freely reused all over the web. At the same time, for-profit companies are continuing to pay to licence her work for commercial purposes--a great example of artists making money using Creative Commons Non-Commercial licences.</p>

<p><strong>Response from Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand to NZ On Air’s discussion paper, “NZ On Air: Online Rights and Public Access.”</strong></p>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) is the kaitiaki of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/">Creative Commons licences in New Zealand</a>. Hosted by the Royal Society of New Zealand, CCANZ supports the roll-out of the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework</a> (NZGOAL).</p>
<p>CCANZ welcomes NZ On Air’s discussion paper “NZ On Air: Online Rights and Public Access.” We believe that the paper is an excellent starting point for further discussion on how to ensure greater access to New Zealand’s publicly funded culture.</p>
<p>CCANZ supports the paper’s conclusion that “public funding needs to be better aligned with enabling public access on multiple platforms.” Following the lead of NZGOAL, we believe that opening up New Zealand’s publicly funded copyright works—including those funded by NZ On Air—would have profound cultural and educational benefits.</p>
<p>Currently, most of New Zealand’s publicly funded or publicly housed cultural heritage is unavailable for reuse by New Zealanders. Despite ongoing digitisation projects, these works are neither commercially available nor publicly reusable. This means that creators who want to build on the works of the past—from student filmmakers to non-profit documentary producers—are either forced to reinvent the wheel or go through a difficult process of asking permission, even when the original works are publicly funded and publicly housed and its creators are long deceased.</p>
<p>For this reason, we would like to widen the scope of the discussion to include Creative Commons licensing. Creative Commons licensing would allow New Zealanders to share and reuse publicly funded copyright works, according to a range of licence conditions. Creative Commons licensing would also provide clarity to heritage institutions and would help mitigate the problem of ‘orphan works’—those works that have no obvious rights holder.</p>
<p>By opening publicly funded copyright works, NZ On Air would be well aligned with the New Zealand Government’s position on open access and open licensing. Approved by Cabinet in July 2010, the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework provides government guidance on the release of works produced by public agencies, specifically advocating the use of Creative Commons licensing for in-copyright works.</p>
<p>Cabinet approved NZGOAL because, as the framework states, “It is widely recognised, in New Zealand and abroad, that significant creative and economic potential may lie dormant in such copyright and non-copyright material when locked up in agencies and not released on terms allowing re-use by others.”</p>
<p>Since then, Cabinet has also approved the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/new-zealand-data-and-information-management-princi" target="_blank">New Zealand Data and Information Management Principles</a>, which are summarised as follows: “government data and information should be open, readily available, well managed, reasonably priced and re-usable unless there are necessary reasons for its protection."</p>
<p>We recognise that this is complex terrain: given the mix of public and private funding involved in the majority of NZ On Air funded works, a blanket model is clearly unworkable. At the same time, it is worth acknowledging the unforeseen consequences of the status quo. Simply put, many contemporary cultural works funded by NZ On Air in 2013 are likely to remain in copyright until at least 2100, restricting the cultural and educational benefits of future dissemination and reuse.</p>
<p>A better system would ensure that publicly funded copyright works were, after a period of time, made publicly available under an open Creative Commons licence. This would provide a window of time for works to be commercialised, while ensuring that older, no longer commercially viable works were able to be shared and reused by the New Zealand public—effectively giving publicly funded culture a second life.</p>
<p>One way to structure this is to follow the paper’s recommendation of a sliding scale, whereby “the level of public funding from NZ On Air influences arrangements to get funded content made available online.” For works that are entirely funded by NZ On Air, and have no obvious commercial value but great cultural value, Creative Commons licensing could be applied soon after the work’s initial broadcast. This would take advantage on the Internet and digital technologies to more widely disseminate publicly funded culture.</p>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand supports the efforts of public funding bodies like NZ On Air to open up New Zealand’s publicly funded culture. We also welcome further public discussion on these issues.</p>
