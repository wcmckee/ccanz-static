<p>Wednesday 9 July, 2014</p>
<p>5.15 to 6.30pm</p>
<p>Sky City, Auckland.</p>
<p>Room TBD</p>
<p>Free</p>
<p>Over the last four years, New Zealand’s culture and knowledge has become indisputably more open. Schools, universities, libraries, public agencies and artists from across the country are now releasing their work into the commons, for everyone to share and reuse.</p>
<p>The commons in New Zealand is growing. But what does this mean for the next generation of artists, writers, researchers and educators? What are their views on copyright, sharing and reuse? And what can we look forward to in the years ahead?</p>
<p>Join us for a wide-ranging, open conversation on the future of the commons in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss how kiwi culture and knowledge -- including textbooks, literature, music and research -- is being released for everyone, free of charge, and free of all legal and technical restrictions.</p>
<p>Featuring a panel discussion with special guests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager at <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a> and author of CC-licensed novel <a href="http://www.lawrenceandgibson.co.nz/p/ad-lib-by-thomasin-sleigh.html" target="_blank"><em>Ad Lib</em></a>, who will talk about open arts and culture.</li>

<br><li>Saiya <span class="gI">Guo, BA/LLB (Hons) student at the University of Auckland and Editor-in-Chief of Debris Journal, who will talk about copyright.

</span>
</li>

<br><li>Cameron McLean, PhD Candidate at the University of Auckland andOpen Science advocate, who will talk about open research.</li>

<br><li>Erika Pearson, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Media, Film, and Communication at the University of Otago and co-author of <em>Media Studies 101 - A Creative Commons Textbook</em>, who will talk about open textbooks.</li>

</ul>
<p>This meetup will take place after the <a href="http://nethui.org.nz/">Nethui conference proceedings</a> on Wednesday 9 July. You don't need to attend the Nethui conference to attend this meetup, though it is encouraged!</p>

<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><b><i>What is Creative Commons?</i></b></span></h4>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) is the kaitiaki of the Creative Commons (CC) licences in Aotearoa New Zealand. We provide free legal tools that help people release their works for others to share and reuse, in order to grow the commons, that store of works freely available to access and reuse. Learn more at <a title="Home" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/">creativecommons.org.nz</a>.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><b><i>Creative Commons Licences and Māori Works</i></b></span></h4>

<p>The CC licences are not always considered appropriate for Māori cultural works. CC licences cannot be applied to works that no longer qualify for copyright protection, which is likely to be true of many older Māori works. Also, the licences do not provide protections against culturally offensive or otherwise inappropriate uses of Māori works.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><b><i>A Free Legal Notice for Māori Works</i></b></span></h4>

<p>For these reasons, CCANZ is looking to produce a free legal notice that Māori can use to release cultural works more openly. The notice will be a clear and standard expression of the freedoms and restrictions that cultural producers or kaitiaki of Māori cultural works wish to apply. While the notice cannot grant additional legal protections, it will aim to educate the public about the status of Māori works, while at the same time allowing for greater access, sharing and reuse.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><em><strong>Why a 'Notice' and not a 'Licence'?</strong></em></span></h4>

<p>A 'licence' is based on rights that are legally recognised, and full legal recognition of rights to mātauranga Māori and taonga works does not yet exist. A 'notice' will help to ensure that members of the public are aware of the status of a particular work, and also know how to share and reuse it appropriately.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><b><i>How Will It Work?

</i></b></span></h4>

<p>While the details are yet to be determined, it is likely that a statement and symbol would be attached to a work. These would, in turn, link to a standard, legally robust statement of the freedoms and restrictions that the work's kaitiaki wish to apply.</p>
<h4><span style="color:#800000;"><b><i>More Information</i></b></span></h4>

<p>Minutes from earlier meetings and our general overview of the issues involved can be found at <a title="Indigenous Knowledge" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/indigenous-knowledge/">our Indigenous Knowledge page</a>.</p>
<h4><b><i><span style="color:#800000;">What Next?</span> </i></b></h4>

<p>We want to know more about what this notice should look like. We are looking for all kinds of feedback, formal and informal, from everyone. We’d love to hear from you. Either get in touch using one of the  channels below, or fill out the Google form. All responses will be confidential.</p>

             <time class="published dt-published" datetime="2014-06-10T11:26:59+12:00">2014-06-10 11:26</time>

<p></p>
<a href="http://www.taupaki.school.nz/Site/Our_School_2.ashx">Taupaki School</a> is a co-educational primary school, located an hour north-west of Auckland. On 20 February 2013, Taupaki School’s Board of Trustees passed a Creative Commons policy, giving permission to Taupaki’s teachers to share and collaborate, legally.
<p>Paula Hogg has been the chair of the Taupaki BoT since 2012, and oversaw the passage of the Creative Commons policy. As Paula explains, the idea for the policy was initially introduced by the school’s principal, Stephen Lethbridge. While the BoT didn’t have any specific expertise on copyright or intellectual property, Stephen ensured that they had all the necessary information.</p>
<p>“We got a great letter from Stephen outlining all the issues, and following that we put it on the agenda for the next meeting. Stephen provided a lot of information for us to read prior to that meeting, so we felt quite well prepared.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, copyright and intellectual property were new issues for the BoT. As Paula says, “Creative Commons was something we’d never heard of -- it wasn’t even on the periphery. While we were aware of copyright laws, we were not as well informed around exactly what was Board and teacher owned.”</p>
<p>According to New Zealand’s <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/57.0/whole.html#DLM345930">1994 Copyright Act</a>, employers hold first ownership of copyright works produced in the course of employment. <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/Copyright-in-Schools/Guidelines-for-schools/For-teachers-and-contractors/Overview-of-copyright-issues#who">As is stated in TKI</a>, the Ministry of Education’s information portal, this means that, “Unless agreed otherwise, the school will own the copyright in any teaching materials that teachers (employees) create during the course of their employment.”</p>
<p>Simply put, this means that teachers who share resources may often be infringing the school's copyright. Creative Commons policies solve this problem by enabling the school to give advance permission to all teachers to legally share and collaborate using an open Creative Commons licence.</p>
<p>Stephen Lethbridge introduced the idea of the policy after noticing that, as he put it in a <a href="http://stephenlethbridge.com/?p=135">blog post</a>, that “teachers were sharing more on more resources online and connecting with a great many schools who were visiting us. It would have been a nightmare to seek permission from the board, more likely the school principal, every time a teacher or student wanted to share information.”</p>
<p>As Paula points out, the policy is also strongly aligned with the school’s existing vision. “Our school’s vision strongly encourages collaboration, and we encourage sharing, so it was a bit of a shock to learn that we needed to have a policy for teachers to share legally.”</p>
<p>“The Creative Commons policy was very aligned with our thinking as a board. There was no dissonance in our discussion. The main issue was that everyone was surprised to discover that this isn’t normal practice.”</p>
<p>According to Paula, the CC policy passed because it supported the fundamental mission of the school -- improving student outcomes. “We knew from the documentation Stephen provided, and from other background reading, that professional development is actually one of the best ways to lift student outcomes. And a big part of professional development is sharing best practice, including resources”</p>
<p>Paula also points out the importance of BoTs aligning their school with existing government policy. While the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/nzgoal" target="_blank">New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework</a> encourages schools to use CC to release copyright works, relatively few schools are aware that the policy exists.</p>
<p>Given the number of policy and procedural issues confronting schools, it’s also unlikely that BoTs will seek out additional policy changes that aren’t brought to their attention.</p>
<p>“It’s important that Boards don’t just view this as a legal obligation and stop there. It does encompass a lot more than that, and it’s important that Boards are aware of that.”</p>
<p>As Stephen points out, “With the <a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/portal/">Network for Learning Portal</a> just around the corner school leaders need to revisit their intellectual property documentation. Creative Commons in Schools isn’t about abdicating responsibility and a copy anything approach. It is about acknowledgement, respect and attribution where the license is determined by the creators of amazing information, resources and ideas within our schools.”</p>

<p>by Herbert Green, 1919. New Zealand. Reproduced courtesy of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. No known copyright restrictions. (O.009829)In November last year, a team of academics, librarians and students got together to hack a media studies textbook – in a weekend.</p>
<p>The textbook was <a href="http://mediatexthack.wordpress.com/about/">published online earlier this year</a> as an open textbook under a Creative Commons Attribution licence, and is available at no cost for educators and students to use. The licence also enables anyone to share, adapt and rewrite the textbook, as long as credit is given to the original creators.</p>
<p>Achieving this over a weekend was obviously an extraordinarily ambitious project – and like any extraordinarily ambitious project, it didn’t always go according to plan.</p>
<p>Happily, the project team, led by Erika Pearson, Bernard Madill, Richard White and Simon Hart at the University of Otago, decided from the beginning to assiduously document the process of hacking the textbook.</p>
<p>The team have now published the Cookbook, a “discussion on the process, pitfalls and successes of hacking an open textbook.”</p>
<p>The Cookbook walks readers through the texthack process, and outlines some of the issues that the team faced, including finding local open materials to embed and locating appropriate infrastructure.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, the Cookbook’s authors conclude that the “curation of this text, and the hack process that drove it, was deeply worthwhile and a highly valuable experience that led to a useful and important output for both those who wrote it and the students and classes that continue to use it.”</p>
<p>The Cookbook itself has the potential to help open textbook projects around the world.</p>
<p>White says “this cookbook will hopefully guide and inspire others to produce their own open educational resources. Just like the textbook we’ve released the cookbook under a Creative Commons Attribution licence. This means that others can add to and improve the recipe using their own experiences with text hacks, without having to ask our permission in advance.”</p>
<p>He sees the project as a return to the “core principles of academia: sharing knowledge, learning from and building on the work of others.”</p>
<p>As White points out, “From my perspective, as a project organiser rather than someone working in the academic discipline, the cookbook represents the most important aspect of the whole project.  While others will be working in different contexts, hopefully everyone who reads the cookbook will find valuable lessons about what worked and what didn’t for us.”</p>
<p>White adds that the team have “already had interest from others who are thinking about what they could do in their own areas, both inside our own university and other national groups.”</p>
<p>The site itself has received thousands of hits from dozens of countries, and feedback had been received requesting the adoption of sections in both secondary and tertiary programs.</p>
<p>The Cookbook is available online <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/texthack/2014/05/15/the-cookbook/">here</a>. If you want a short introduction to the process of hacking an open textbook, Erika has kindly provided her hugely popular <a href="https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/texthack/2014/05/15/a-recap-of-a-texthack-in-gifs-because-why-not/">GIF-heavy recap</a>.</p>

<p>When Land Information New Zealand officials, prompted by the support in NZGOAL for free culture CC licenses, started liberating the <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/09/linz-data-service/" target="_blank">publicly-funded map data they hold</a> under CC-BY, they may have anticipated that their data could end up in OpenStreetMap.org (OSM). OSM is the libre licensed, crowdsourced, world mapping project (formerly CC-BY-SA, now Open DataBase License) created as a free-as-in-speech alternative to Google Maps, which licenses copyright map and image data from other companies. What they probably never imagined was their data appearing on community sites like the new NSW government funded <a href="http://www.timebanking.com.au/" target="_blank">TimeBanking platform</a> and in maps powered by Leafet, the free code, mobile-friendly, web map engine which uses OSM as the default source for map data. Such are the unintended benefits that flow from sharing in the commons.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6030" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LDS-Dunedin.jpg" alt="X" width="546" height="366"></a> Screenshot of <a href="https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/1910-otago-075m-rural-aerial-photos-2004-2011/" target="_blank">Otago 0.75m aerial photography</a> by LINZ. Made available under a Creative Commons Attribution licence</p>
<p>Just as OSM contributed to the development of websites using Leaflet, the cultural commons also has a contribution to make to the development of free code speech recognition software. Douglas Bagnall gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6BGLrLXm3c" target="_blank">a great talk</a> about free code speech recognition engines at Kiwi PyCon 2012, and one of the main non-coding challenges he identified is the lack of a suitably large corpus of spoken speech with which to train' the software (the interesting bits for non-coders starts at about 3:00), particularly for less common accents like New Zealand English.</p>
<p>Douglas mentioned a site called VoxForge.org and encouraged us all to record some speech for it. VoxForge collects samples of speech to "compile them into acoustic models for use with Open Source speech recognition engines", with both the acoustic models and the source data are made available under the GNU General Public License, the free code software license used by the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Voxforge is a great resource, but it would be a lot of work to drive enough 'Nu Zylnd' accented speakers there. and it occurred to me recently that there is another source of spoken speech for which there is strong argument for libre licensing; public interest radio. Releasing audio programs made for National Radio, student radio, and community access radio, under a libre license (eg CC-BY), has always seemed like a no-brainer to me. Even before I set up <a href="posts/2014/05/07/cc-nz@groups.creativecommons.org.nz" target="_blank">the CC-NZ email list</a>, I was contacting community radio people and telling them about the potential benefits of podcasting and CC licensing for increasing program exposure, as part of my work with Aotearoa.Indymedia.org.</p>
<p>National Radio are publicly-owned and funded, and currently podcast all their programs in both MP3 and Ogg Vorbis formats. Student radio stations have also been experimenting with recording their shows and turning them into podcasts, and if they libre licensed the sometimes substantial spoken word parts of recordings like <a href="http://www.mixcloud.com/radio1/" target="_blank">the Radio1 shows shared on MixCloud</a>, they'd be unlikely to miss out on any commercial return.</p>
<p>Community access radio stations, as their name suggests, exist to give special interest groups in our communities access to the airwaves, so their unique voices have a chance to be heard in broadcast media. Access stations are heavily subsidised by public broadcasting funding, and their programs aren't expected to have commercial potential.</p>
<p>Whenever these programs are rebroadcast, both the program producers, and the public who subsidize their production, get more bang for their buck. Over the last decade or so, access radio stations have been building up the infrastructure to digitally record programs, so they can be made available as podcasts, on sites like accessradio.org.</p>
<p>What I notice in all three cases though, is that despite NZGOAL-inspired wave of CC license adoptions across public service organisations from LINZ, to schools and tertiary institutions, to archives and museums, I see no sign of CC licenses on locally made radio so far. I'm guessing one issue is legal confusion and risk aversion.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to CC my radio program, what about the copyright songs I played during the program? Who owns the copyright on ads, and is it acceptable to remove them? Radio stations and rebroadcast sites can pay a fixed fee to collection organisations like NZRIA and APRA for permission to play the songs, but they can't pass on that permission to anyone who rebroadcasts the program.</p>
<p>What can we do to show public radio stations that libre licensing - CC or otherwise - is a good fit for their organizational mission, and help them negotiate the legal minefields around copyright? Between them, the RadioNZ, community access, and students stations have vast numbers of hours of recordings, covering a wide range of kiwi accents spoken regularly on ethnic community radio programs. Having these available under a libre license would have benefits beyond just sharing the information and perspective included in public interest radio programs.</p>
<p>It could also be tremendously helpful to people working on getting free code/ open source speech recognition software to recognise New Zilnd accents, which in turn would be tremendously helpful for any kiwi wanting a speech-operated computer that respects their software freedom. The same would be true for speakers of Te Reo Māori, and other Polynesian languages, who, like NZ English speakers, are also less likely to record enough speech at sites like VoxForge for them to generate a useful acoustic model.</p>
<p>In '<a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html" target="_blank">The Coming Civil War over General Purpose Computing</a>', Cory Doctorow asks us to consider the implications if the proprietary software running on many of our personal computers was instead running on our bionic legs;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">"If I can lo-jack your legs, I can lease them to you with the confidence of my power to repo them if you default on payments. If I can't, I may not lease you legs unless you've got a lot of money to begin with. But if your legs can decide to walk to the repo-depot without your consent, you will be totally screwed the day that muggers, rapists, griefers or the secret police figure out how to hijack that facility."</p>

<p>Like bionic legs, accessibility tools like speech recognition and text-to-speech are augmentations which restore equalit, helping people with conditions from blindness to quadraplegia to have the full use of computers and the internet that most of us take for granted. Such essential tools should not be subject to the price pumping and hidden agendas that go with proprietary sofware.</p>

<p>In the middle of March, we held a series of events on <a title="Creative Commons Policies for Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/03/creative-commons-policies-for-schools/" target="_blank">Creative Commons policies in schools</a> in Christchurch, Auckland and Wellington. The events featured lightning talks from a handful of experts in government, law and education, who outlined the legal, technical and cultural reasons for schools to implement a Creative Commons policy.</p>
<p>While we couldn't manage to record video of the events, we have recorded the audio for the final event in Wellington. Unfortunately, Carolyn Stuart and Mark Osborne weren't able to attend, though Ian Munro was able to speak to Carolyn's slides, and we've included a quick summary of their talks below.</p>

CCANZ works to achieve these goals in two ways. First, it offers free licences. Second, it runs eight different projects, which advocate for licence use is various areas, such as research, data, government and heritage.</p>
<p>Matt then ran through eight different points, which are detailed in the slides. The general point of his talk was that while the internet and digital technologies have made sharing and reuse very easy, copyright law still represents a significant legal barrier. This is particularly true in the case of teaching resources, which remain the property of the Board of Trustees. He finished his talk by suggesting that Creative Commons licensing -- and a Creative Commons policy -- can help to address these IP problems in New Zealand schools, while actively encouraging sharing and collaboration.</p>

The pictures on your phone, the emails to your mother, the embarrassing poems you wrote when you were in year 12 – all of these works qualify for copyright protection. Ordinarily, you, as creator, own the copyright to those works.</p>
<p>However, if you create the work in the course of your employment, then the copyright belongs to your employer. This means that the copyright to all teaching resources produced by teachers in the course of their employment as teachers is owned by the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>What if the BoT wanted to share teaching resources with other schools? It could say, 'here, use it.' From a lawyer’s perspective, though, this is imprecise. There might be a bunch of other things the board hasn't thought about, such as commercial reuse, attribution and liability.</p>
<p>It's better, then, to use a standardised, legally robust licence, such as those provided by Creative Commons. It's more flexible, and provides protection for both you and the user. Andrew then ran through the Creative Commons licences, noting that the New Zealand licences were relatively clear and plain English.</p>
<p>Andrew ended his presentation by outlining New Zealand's limited 'fair dealing' exceptions. These exceptions do not offer hard and fast rules. Instead, the definition of 'fair' depends on the facts of an individual case, including the amount that is used, its impact on the market of a work, and the nature of the use in question.</p>

As she pointed out, the New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing framework supports the use of Creative Commons licensing across the state sector. NZGOAL provides a 'review and release process' that enables agencies to decide whether a work is suitable for release under an open licence. In the education sector, the Ministry of Education must use NZGOAL to release its copyright materials; schools and universities are encouraged to participate.</p>
<p>But why would they? Keitha argued that a Creative Commons policy is a way for BoTs to require teachers to use and create licensed materials. It's also a way to encourage students to use and create legally licensed materials. More broadly, the adoption of Creative Commons policies will make the education system in New Zealand more efficient and innovative, as teachers spend less time reinventing the wheel and more time sharing, collaborating and building on each other's work.</p>
<p>Schools can do this by passing an open data policy – otherwise known as a Creative Commons IP policy – encouraging teachers to collaborate and share, rather than compete and duplicate efforts. This policy requires teachers to apply a Creative Commons Attribution licence when sharing resources, and use a 'no known copyright' statement if releasing a work has fallen out of copyright. Keitha finished her presentation by pointing to an open licence used by Te Ara – The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand. She also pointed to the vast amount of works available through Flickr and many other repositories searchable through CC search.</p>

On the one hand, some teachers are protective of their resources, or lack confidence in their quality; on the other hand, many teachers are more than happy to share resources with anyone who asks. As new technologies and pedagogies arise, Ian argued that more and more teachers will become interested in sharing and collaboration.</p>
<p>When teachers begin to share resources, however, they have to confront the fact that, under the Copyright Act, their resources are owned by their Board of Trustees. This presents a significant hurdle to the sharing of digital resources, one that is most effectively addressed by adopting a Creative Commons IP policy at every school.</p>
<p>As Ian explained, IP was one of the issues faced by the MoE as it looked to source teaching resources for schools after the February 2011 Canterbury earthquake. Many schools found themselves unable to access their resources, which were either destroyed or stuck in unsafe buildings. In response, the MoE asked many of New Zealand's top performing schools to provide subject area resources.</p>
<p>This was not as easy as it sounds. Some schools, for instance, were keen to ensure that the resources wouldn't be made to other schools. Other schools thought that it was a great opportunity to develop a online repository for teaching resources, and were more than happy to oblige. But even schools that were happy to oblige found that their files had no clear metadata attached, including no standardised naming schema, file organisation or file formats. This made it incredibly difficult for outsiders to find the resources they needed.</p>

The portal is also a great reason for schools to adopt a Creative Commons policy, as it is going to make it much easier to find and share resources. Pond will act as a safe online environment for educators to share and collaborate, but it will require schools to clarify their positions on Intellectual Property, as it will be both the teacher's responsibility to ensure that they have permission to legally share content.

A colleague asked to borrow the resource, and Stephen, in the spirit of collegiality, said yes, at which point the colleague proceeded to sell the resource to a publishing company. Stephen, hoping for royalties, complained to the principal, who pointed out that it was the school that owned the rights to the resource – and that it was the school that would be collect any royalty payments.</p>
<p>We are, Stephen said, is an age of connectivity, and we are sharing more than ever. And teachers share as much as anyone, remixing and reusing resources to fit the needs of individual classrooms. New Zealand has also emerged beyond the competitive, contestable funding approach; with the recent development of Learning and Change Networks and collaboration on ICT, schools are increasingly being expected to share best practice with each other.</p>
<p>It’s important, then, that Boards of Trustees acknowledge that this is an age of sharing and collaboration – even when the professional instincts of BoT members, who may come from corporate backgrounds, are to commercialise educational resources produced at the school. This drive towards sharing and collaboration needs to be based in the vision of the school. At Taupaki, this vision was developed by the teachers and local community – without input from Stephen himself. This vision was included a desire to encourage collaboration , and this was a core part of Stephen’s sales pitch to the BoT.</p>
<p>Stephen submitted a discussion document to the BoT, and drew on these parts of their vision, as well as the potential for sharing in the Network for Learning, and it was passed just before Stephen went on study leave. But the implementation will be the challenge, and it is still early days. As Stephen said, quoting Friere, “ideas that are acquired with ease are discarded with ease.”</p>

A policy that enabled and encouraged sharing and collaboration was a great fit with the vision of the school.</p>
<p>Quoting David Wiley, Mark argued that sharing and collaboration is fundamental to education: "without sharing, there is no education." However, Mark also pointed out that openness is a new concept for many, including members of the Board of Trustees who may come from a commercial background. This meant that the policy required a shift in mental models. Instead of the 'see-saw' metaphor -- whereby a gain for one is a loss for the other -- Mark advocated a shift to a 'rising tide' metaphor, whereby sharing and collaboration benefits everyone, including those doing the sharing and collaborating.</p>
<p>He then pointed out several concrete examples of sharing communities, including the VLN and Wikieducator, where ASHS has had an active presence for many years. Mark concluded by discussing into other forms of openness, such as open software and open hardware, arguing that schools should be wary of locking their students into closed applications run by off-shore multi-nationals. Instead, schools should explore the range of free and open alternatives.</p>

<h5><em>By Hannah Mettner</em></h5>
<p>Richard White is an interesting example of an artist using CC to make his own creative output available, while working in a job that clearly demonstrates the pitfalls and possibilities of copyright and open access day in and day out.</p>
<p>Richard has made two of his albums available for download on Bandcamp, <a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">under the name Mermaid Guitar</a>. He began by offering his earlier album, <a href="http://mermaidguitar.bandcamp.com/album/me-for-a-day" target="_blank">‘Me for a Day’</a>, with a five dollar price tag, and then decided to offer ‘Barry Starr’ for free, with the “name your price” function, where users choose how much they’d like to pay.</p>
<p>Despite being available for free, the second album has had more downloads <i>and</i> more sales -- so he’s now offering the earlier album under the same terms. For Richard, this makes the process of selling an album more exciting. As he puts it, “People have paid a lot more than I thought they might, more than the five dollars I initially offered the first album for."</p>
<p>[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2754915517 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=1]</p>
<p>Plenty of others have downloaded his music for free, but Richard says that he’s totally happy with this. “Ultimately I just like the idea that someone’s listening to my music on their iPod on the other side of the world”. But he’s also careful to point out that he doesn’t try to make a living from his music and concedes that, for those who do, there are greater challenges.</p>
<p>As part of the production process, Richard sourced all artwork for ‘Barry Starr’ from Public Domain or CC sources, but he says finding images which could be used with the CC BY SA licence he used for the album, which also fit his purpose, was trickier than he thought.</p>
<p>“There were some great images I really liked, but they had either ND or, more commonly, NC," Richard says. "Given that people could pay, I couldn’t use NC. I guess the difficulty I had finding good stuff showed me that open access is still at the ‘evangelical’ stage in many respects and we need more converts for it to become more self-sustaining”.</p>
<p>[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2754915517 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=6]</p>
<p>By day, Richard works as Copyright Officer at the University of Otago, addressing any copyright issues or questions encountered by staff and research students there. This can be a challenge: while most staff have an understanding of the broad concepts of copyright, it can be a complex web of legislation, licences and rights.</p>
<p>Richard has found himself a staunch advocate of open access in the tertiary sector and CC as the main vehicle for that. “CC licences simplify a lot of things from a copyright point of view”, he says. “Often a staff member or a PhD student will come to me or one of our library staff with questions about permission for something they want to use in a piece of research. One of the most common problems is that they just don’t hear from someone they’ve contacted to get permission”.</p>
<p>He says a lot of the time accessibility is the last thing researchers and academics are thinking about. They’re  used to things being done a certain way and aren’t necessarily aware of the open access alternatives. Their reputations as academics are affected by how often they’re being published in scholarly journals, and the quality of those journals is taken into account too.</p>
<p>“That’s the major roadblock for open access publications, just getting enough visibility and usage to attract good quality research, to gain a name as a good journal, not just an open access journal. I mean, I’d love it if all research was open”.</p>
<p>[bandcamp width=100% height=42 album=2765089846 size=small bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 t=4]</p>
<p>Other countries are mandating that all publicly funded research should be open -- the U.S. Government, for example -- but New Zealand isn’t making any moves yet. Instead academics do their research, write it up, submit it for publication, go through the peer review process, and are accepted into these big journals where they’re published, which universities around the world then pay subscription fees to access.</p>
<p>He appreciates the freedom Creative Commons licences give both creator and reuser, academic and artistic. “When someone has used a CC licence they’ve declared up front what they’re happy for others to do with their work. So part of my work is helping people understand the implications of their choices with their own work as part of the knowledge ecosystem.</p>
<p>"In that respect it’s no different from choosing CC in an artistic medium: you’re sharing your work for others to use and build on.  I can’t claim that my music has informed great cultural achievements but there are people who’ve put it in compilations or used it in their films, which is immensely satisfying”.</p>

<p>Over the last week, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has been running <a title="Creative Commons Workshops" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schools">free ‘CC in Schools’ workshops</a> across the country. Later in the week, we’ll post slides, audio and summaries of each of the speakers, as well as the issues raised in the lively Q&amp;As that followed.</p>
<p>With support from <a href="https://internetnz.net.nz/" target="_blank">InternetNZ</a>, these workshops talked about how a growing number of New Zealand schools are using CC licensing to share their teaching resources. Resource sharing, of course, isn’t new: everyday, teachers share countless resources across a range of vibrant professional networks, from the <a href="http://www.vln.school.nz/" target="_blank">VLN</a> to subject-area email lists. For the most part, though, resource sharing among teachers is necessarily informal. It often takes place in the form of email attachments, without licensing or metadata attached.</p>
<p>This means that other teachers, who may be new to the profession -- or who may simply not be part of that specific conversation or network – tend to miss out. They may, as a result, end up having to reinvent that resource later on, which gives them less time for the many, many other things teachers have do.</p>
<p>It would be nice, then, if New Zealand had a central, searchable repository of properly labelled and openly licensed teacher-made resources. (If you’re not sure we need such a repository, check out the site visits at<a href="http://maths.nayland.school.nz/" target="_blank"> Nayland College's excellent Maths portal</a> (soon to be CC-licensed!) – it’s had over <i>1.28 million</i>).</p>
<p>The good news is that the <a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/portal/" target="_blank">Network for Learning portal</a> looks set to help meet this demand. While the portal is still in beta, it has the capacity to allow teachers to find and reuse free and open resources from the entire New Zealand teaching community. This would mean that teachers, including those new to teaching, could spend less time reinventing the wheel, and more time adapting quality resources for their individual classrooms.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But the barriers to sharing resources are not only technical – they’re legal. Under <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345930.html" target="_blank">section 21 of the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994</a>, where an employee makes copyright works “in the course of his or her employment [...] that person's employer is the first owner of any copyright in the work.”</p>
<p>What to do? The so<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SRR-Legally.png"><img class="wp-image-5229 alignleft" alt="SRR Legally" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SRR-Legally.png" width="249" height="255"></a>lution for many New Zealand schools is a <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank">Creative Commons IP policy</a>, approved by a school’s BoT. This policy gives teachers permission in advance to share resources under an open Creative Commons licence. This means that teachers can legally make the most of online resource sharing portals, such as the Network for Learning (or <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikieducator</a>).</p>
<p>Such policies are also supported by the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/" target="_blank">New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework</a>, approved by Cabinet in 2010. This framework instructs core agencies – like the Ministry of Education – to consider using Creative Commons licences when releasing copyright works. Happily, NZGOAL also encourages Boards of Trustees to do the same.</p>
<p>But why use a CC licence? Simply put, an open licence gives others teachers clarity about what they can do with your work and how you wish to be credited. As Andrew Matangi – who had a big hand in writing the CC licences -- pointed out in the workshops, the licences are also legally robust, which means that you don’t need to worry about issues like liability. (Andrew’s example was a malfunctioning science experiment).</p>
<p>Importantly, the more open CC licenses also allow the creation of ‘derivative’ works – that is to say, these licences let you adapt and improve the works. As every teacher knows, this is crucial, as even the best resources need to be tweaked or remixed for the unique challenges of individual classrooms. Simply put, digital technologies make remix easy; CC licences make remix legal.</p>
<p>This sounds quite legalistic, but the primary effects of a CC policy – as Stephen Lethbridge and Mark Osborne both pointed out – are <i>cultural</i>. Stephen and Mark’s CC policies were passed to support their schools’ desire to be collaborative, open and networked places, where teachers and students share, make and innovate.</p>

<p>Next week, a range of teachers, principals, government officials and copyright experts are getting together to discuss how New Zealand teachers can legally share and reuse teaching resources.</p>
<p>Speakers include Andrew Matangi from Buddle Findlay, Stephen Lethbridge, principal of Taupaki School and Carolyn Stuart, Education Sector Lead for the Network for Learning.</p>
<p>Taking place in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, the events follow the rapid uptake of Creative Commons licensing policies by New Zealand schools. These policies make it legal for teachers to share their resources without asking advance permission from the school.</p>
<p>As Matt McGregor, Public Lead of Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ, points out, more than forty New Zealand schools have now adopted Creative Commons policies, up from four in March 2013. These schools include Tawa Intermediate, Albany Senior High School and Taupaki School.</p>
<p>“New Zealand has over 50,000 teachers working in over 2,500 schools,” says McGregor. “If teachers were encouraged to legally share and collaborate – rather than reinvent the wheel – the savings of time and money across the education sector are potentially enormous.”</p>
<p>Stephen Lethbridge, Principal of Taupaki School, points out that it’s in the nature of teachers to share.</p>
<p>Taupaki School passed its Creative Commons policy after noticing that, as <a href="http://stephenlethbridge.com/?p=135" target="_blank">Lethbridge puts it</a>, “teachers were sharing more on more resources online and connecting with a great many schools who were visiting us. It would have been a nightmare to seek permission from the board, more likely the school principal, every time a teacher or student wanted to share information.”</p>
<p>Mark Osborne, former Deputy Principal of Albany Senior High School, <a title="Albany Senior High School" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/albany-senior-high-school/" target="_blank">points out</a> that the use of Creative Commons has had broader cultural effects at the school.</p>
<p>As he said in 2012, “The big change taking place is that teachers are collaborating more, and they’re also involving their students in the development of those teaching and learning resources. This is quite different from what happens in most schools.”</p>
<p>Creative Commons policies have been supported by the New Zealand Government’s Open Access and Licensing framework, or NZGOAL, approved by Cabinet in 2010. This framework outlines massive cultural, economic and educational benefits of sharing publicly funded copyright materials.</p>
