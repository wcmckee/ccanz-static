<h3>A message from CC International...</h3>

As a supporter of Creative Commons, you recognise the importance of what we do to make knowledge easily, freely, and legally available to everyone.



<strong>We are excited to announce the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/catalyst" target="_blank">Catalyst Grants program</a></strong>, through which we will be awarding grants of $1000 to $10,000 to researchers, educators and technologists around the world. Grant recipients will be selected through a rigorous public review and transparent evaluation process involving representatives from CC’s affiliate institutions.



<strong>Catalyst Grants will make it possible for individuals and organisations to harness the power of Creative Commons</strong>. A grant might enable a group in a developing country to research how Open Educational Resources can positively impact its community. Another could pay for a programmer to add CC licence support to tools for publishing and distributing news. A third could fund a study of entrepreneurs using Creative Commons licences to create a new class of socially responsible businesses.



<strong>But we can’t do it <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate" target="_blank">without your help</a></strong>. Our goal is to raise $100,000 from CC supporters like you to fund the Catalyst Grants. Please <a href="https://support.creativecommons.org/donate" target="_blank">donate today</a> to help spread our mission of openness and innovation across cultural and national boundaries.



Thank you,



Joi Ito
