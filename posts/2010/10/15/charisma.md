Our favourite Kiwi synth master Luke Rowell of Disasteradio has released a new full length album today under a "pay what you like" system complete with its own Creative Commons licence.



Charisma is an eleven track work <a href="http://disasteradio.bandcamp.com/" target="_self">available for download here</a> on bandcamp. Even though you're able to obtain the album for free, the option to give some money for this 'cyberspace post-apocalyptic symphonic love epic' is made really easy on the online checkout system. Or, you can show support by ordering a <a href="http://alowhum.com/disasteradio-charisma/" target="_self">sweet Disasteradio fridge magnet</a> through the A Low Hum label. It appears to be the largest fridge magnet in history.



Disasteradio had previously released five albums for download under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike licence</a> which you can read more about <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/creative_commoners/luke_rowell_disasteradio" target="_self">on our website here</a>. Interestingly Luke has decided to return to CC licensing for his tracks after releasing a freely downloadable 'all rights reserved' album called <a href="http://disasteradio.bandcamp.com/album/visions-video-single" target="_self">Visions</a>. This time he's going with something in-between, an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_self">Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works licence</a> to satisfy his wish to monitor adaptations after a mammoth effort was invested in Charisma's production.



It's easy enough to get in touch with Disasteradio to request remixing permissions, which appears to be the object here of using a CC licence restricting derivatives - to ensure direct dialogue between the artist and those who might want to repurpose the work.



Disasteradio has used a fascinating range of licences over the last few years - lets see if the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_self">CC BY-NC-ND</a> and 'pay what you like' approach strikes a warm balance for Charisma in the coming months.



Well done Luke!
