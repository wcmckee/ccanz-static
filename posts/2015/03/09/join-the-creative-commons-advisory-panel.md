Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand invite expressions of interest for placement on the CCANZ Advisory Panel.



We are specifically interested in hearing from those with experience or involvement in Māori knowledge groups and those vested in the study of and advocacy for Mātauranga Māori.



The purpose of the panel is to provide guidance on the governance and strategic direction of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand and its future development.



A placement on the panel will involve quarterly meetings and an appropriate level of contact with the CCANZ team. The appointment to the panel will run to June 2017. Panel membership is voluntary and unpaid, though CCANZ is able to cover travel expenses to attend meetings.



Current panel member Karaitiana Taiuru will act as tuākana to the successful candidate prior to his or her first meeting.



Please send us your expression of interest (or a suggestion for a suitable candidate) by <strong>3 April 2015</strong> to: <a href="mailto:matt@creativecommons.org.nz">matt@creativecommons.org.nz</a>



We welcome any questions you might have. For more information about Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, please<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz"> visit our website</a>.



Nāku noa, nā,
