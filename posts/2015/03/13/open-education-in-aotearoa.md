<html><body><p>Educational resources are becoming increasingly unaffordable: since 1978, textbook prices have risen 812%. According to research from the US Public Interest Research Groups, 65% of students choose not to buy a college textbook because it’s too expensive and 94% report that they suffer academically because of this choice.



As a result, more and more educators -- and higher education institutions -- have committed to develop and reuse <a title="Open Education" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/education/">Open Educational Resources</a> (OERs). OERs are resources that made openly available, free of technical, legal and price restrictions on reuse.



Come along to hear about the future of Open Educational Resources in Aotearoa, featuring:

</p><ul>

	<li>Billy Meinke, formerly of Creative Commons International, who will talk about his experience with some of the world's largest OER projects, including the US Government's $2billion TAAACT grants for OERs at community colleges.</li>

	<li>Simon Hart, Richard White and Erika Pearson from the Media Text Hack team at the University of Otago, who will talk about the development of an open, CC-licensed Media Studies textbook -- over the course of a weekend.</li>

	<li>Matt McGregor, Public Lead of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, who will talk about the future of OERs in the New Zealand tertiary sector, and how educators and institutions can create, use and adopt open textbooks.</li>
