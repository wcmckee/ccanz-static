<html><body><p>Because some of our funding runs July to June, I tend to think of CCANZ's year starting on 1 July. So, to celebrate the new year, I thought I'd share some of what we've been up to over the last twelve months:<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3530" title="Remix Kiwi" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Remix-Kiwi.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="236"></a>



<strong>Talks &amp; Workshops </strong>



Over these twelve months, CCANZ gave fifty-two talks and workshops. This included twenty-seven to schools, thirteen to Universities and CRIs, two to the data community, three to the culture and heritage sector and seven to non-profits and NGOs.



<strong>Web Site</strong>



<strong> </strong>On 8 August 2012, we launched our new website (the one you're on). From this date to 30 June, we posted seventy-seven times. We announced events, blogged, hosted a bunch of guest posts for Open Access Week and, of course, published case studies of Creative Commons users.



<strong>Case Studies </strong>



From 1 July to 30 June, we published twenty-four case studies. The breakdown here was a little different than our talks and workshops: we published three case studies on schools, two on universities or CRIs, four on open data, three in the GLAM sector, three on non-profits or NGOs and nine on Creative Commons artists.



<strong>Resources</strong>



We wrote, designed and distributed 12,000 A3 posters, 4,000 Free to Mix guides and 1000 A2 Creative Commons posters.
