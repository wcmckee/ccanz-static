It hardly seems like a year since Open Access Week 2014 -- which means I must now have been at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand for just over a year! Running NZCommons during Open Access Week 2014 was one of my first jobs when I started. I started a learning curve then that is still going up and up!



Today's the first day of Open Access Week 2015 so here's some great reading and viewing from around the world to get you started:

<h5>A Quiet Revolution - Open Access in Aotearoa</h5>

Our forthcoming book, <i>A Quiet Revolution: Growing Creative Commons in Aotearoa New Zealand</i>, features a new essay on the rise of Open Access in Aotearoa, plus case studies from around the country. It will be published as an ebook later this year, but we'd love to be able to make a small print run as well. To that end, we're <a href="https://www.pledgeme.co.nz/projects/4119-creative-commons-aotearoa-print-book" target="_blank">running a crowdfunding campaign on PledgeMe</a>. Pledging $25 or more is the only way to get your hands on a print copy - complete with your name gracing the acknowledgements pages! Thank you so much to everyone who has already pledged.



Happy Open Access Week!</body></html>
