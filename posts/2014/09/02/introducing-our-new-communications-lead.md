<html><body><p>Kia ora everyone, my name is Elizabeth Heritage and I’m the new Communications Lead here at Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ. Today’s my first day and I’m really excited to get started!



I’m a British Kiwi and have lived in the UK and NZ. I’m a publisher by trade, although I have also been a policy advisor, intellectual property officer and librarian. I have a keen interest in practical copyright from both consumer and commercial points of view, and am really looking forward to getting stuck in to the creative commons landscape here in Aotearoa. As a publisher, I’m particularly interested in the ways creative commons can be applied to books, especially ebooks, so do get in touch if you have thoughts or experiences to share on that front.



I’ll be at CCANZ here in Wellington two days a week - you can contact me on <a href="mailto:elizabeth@creativecommons.org.nz">elizabeth@creativecommons.org.nz</a>. When I’m not here, I’m probably either reading (my lifelong passion) or out and about helping make books happen, working freelance with publishers and authors.



I’m looking forward to meeting the creative commons community and getting to know you and what you’re up to, so please do drop me a line to introduce yourself.



Ngā mihi nui, na Elizabeth</p></body></html>
