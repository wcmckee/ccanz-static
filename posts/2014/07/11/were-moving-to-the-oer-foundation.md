<html><body><p>On behalf of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, I'm excited to announce that we're moving affiliate hosts to the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank">Open Education Resource Foundation</a>.



This will mark the end of our four year affiliate relationship with the Royal Society of New Zealand.



CCANZ came to the Royal Society in 2010, after the Council for the Humanities – the original affiliate host – joined the Society.



Under the umbrella of the Royal Society, CCANZ has gone from strength to strength. We've seen a rapid increase in CC licence adoption across Aotearoa New Zealand.



Most of the CC community won't notice the difference. We'll still be based in Wellington, and we'll still be actively spreading the word about CC all around the country.



A big thanks to the Royal Society of New Zealand for hosting CCANZ for the last four years, and a equally big thanks to the OER Foundation for agreeing to be our new affiliate hosts.



Thanks also to Wayne Mackintosh of the OER Foundation and Fabiana Kubke, Chair of the CCANZ Panel, who have been working tirelessly to make this happen, as have the rest of the CCANZ Panel. A final thanks to Andrew Matangi from the Legal Team for providing ongoing advice.



Looking ahead, we've got plenty of projects in the pipeline -- and plenty more ideas -- so watch out for more announcements in the weeks and months ahead. </p></body></html>
