<html><body><p>"Open content licensing for educators" is a free <strong>online</strong> workshop held from <strong>23rd - 27th January 2012</strong>. It is designed for educators who want to learn more about open education resources, copyright, and creative commons licences.



The course materials were developed as a collaborative project by volunteers from the OER Foundation, WikiEducator, the OpenCourseWare Consortium and Creative Commons with funding support from UNESCO. The course will provide prerequisite knowledge required by educators to legally remix open education materials and help institutions to take informed decisions about open content licences.
