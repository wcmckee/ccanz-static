<html><body><p>The Ministers of Finance and Internal Affairs have released a <a href="http://business.scoop.co.nz/2011/08/15/open-data-will-benefit-public-economy-english/" target="_self">statement</a> today detailing a new Declaration on Open and Transparent Government.



<em>“Today the Government is releasing a declaration that clearly sets out our expectation that agencies should release all non-personal and unclassified data with high potential value for re-use,” </em>says Finance Minister Bill English<em>.</em>



Included in the full <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/declaration-open-and-transparent-government" target="_self">Declaration on Open and Transparent Government statement</a>, is the notion that "The government holds data on behalf of the New Zealand public. We release it to enable the private and community sectors to use it to grow the economy, strengthen our social and cultural fabric, and sustain our environment. We release it to encourage business and community involvement in government decision-making."

The <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/new-zealand-data-and-information-management-princi" target="_self">New Zealand Data and Information Management Principles</a> have also been approved to ensure high quality management of the information the government holds on the behalf of the public.



One such Principal is that materials should be 'Reusable':

	<li><em>in re-usable, machine-readable format</em></li>

	<li><em>with appropriate metadata; and</em></li>

	<li><em>in aggregate or modified forms if they cannot be released in their original state.</em></li>

</ul>

<em>Data and information released in proprietary formats are also released in open, non-proprietary formats.</em>
