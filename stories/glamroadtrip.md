<html><body><p>In March 2015, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is going on the road! We're travelling all around the country to provide free workshops and events for the culture and heritage sector on all things copyright and Creative Commons.



This an opportunity for those working in the culture and heritage sector to learn about the practical applications of copyright and Creative Commons copyright licensing. We'll also talk about how organisations can adopt Creative Commons policies to clarify the rights on their existing collection items and ensure that more of their donated works are made openly available. We'll also introduce a range of <a title="Open GLAM resources" href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/all/?&amp;topic=openglam" target="_blank">new free resources</a> on all things Open GLAM.



If you're interested in attending, please RSVP using the form below. If you're keen to host a workshop in your region or organisation, then either let us know in the form below, or email Matt: matt@creativecommons.org.nz. We'll be updating this page as things progress, so check back soon.



Please help us spread the word by sharing the link to this page and <a title="GLAM Road Trip poster" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cc-by-GLAM-a3.pdf" target="_blank">downloading the poster</a>!
