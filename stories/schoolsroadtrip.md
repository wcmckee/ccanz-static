<html><body><p>In March 2015, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is going on the road! We're travelling all around the country to provide free workshops and events for teachers on all things copyright and Creative Commons.



This an opportunity for teachers, school leaders and Board of Trustees members to learn about how to make, share, find and reuse free and open educational resources. We'll also talk about how schools can adopt Creative Commons policies, to give permission for teachers to share and collaborate, and introduce a range of <a title="CC resources for schools" href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/all/?&amp;topic=schools" target="_blank">new free resources</a> for educators and schools.



If you're interested in attending, please RSVP using the form below. If you're keen to host a workshop in your region or organisation, then either let us know in the form below, or email Matt: matt@creativecommons.org.nz. We'll be updating this page as more details firm up, so check back soon.



Please help us spread the word by sharing the link to this page and <a title="Schools Road Trip poster" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cc-by-school-a3.pdf" target="_blank">downloading the poster!</a>
