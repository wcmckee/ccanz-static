Come along and hear from <a href="https://twitter.com/kaythaney" target="_blank">Kaitlin Thaney</a>, CEO of Mozilla Labs about the future of open research practice. We will also hear from people in universities, government, and the private sector who are active in open practice.



As a inaugural director of the Mozilla Science Lab Kaitlin Thaney fosters an ongoing dialogue between the open web community and researchers, highlighting the need for the development of essential skills for data science and how these skills can create new opportunities within and beyond specific research areas.



Previously Kaitlin was an advisor for the UK government on digital infrastructure and data science and she currently has a strong focus on the development of policy around digital science, data, and open practices, supporting the development of skills. Kaitlin is also on the board of Directors of Datakind UK, a not-for-profit organisation that ‘does good with data’ by bringing together leading data scientists with societal good organizations to make data work in service of humanity.
