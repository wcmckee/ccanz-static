<html><body><p>Are you interested in spreading the word about Creative Commons in New Zealand? We need your help!<strong> </strong>



There are currently two ways to volunteer for Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand. The first thing you can do is help an organisation, such as a school, adopt Creative Commons licensing policy and practice. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2015/06/volunteer-to-adopt-an-organisation-2/" target="_blank">We outline more about what this means here</a>.



The second thing you can do is write for our community website, NZCommons.org.nz. NZCommons is a community website dedicated to discussing the opportunities and challenges of opening New Zealand’s culture and knowledge for access and reuse, with a particular focus on copyright, licensing and the public domain.



If you're keen to help out, please fill out the form, below. While you're at it, <a title="Volunteer Guidelines" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/volunteer-guidelines/">please read our volunteer guidelines</a>, which outline your rights and responsibilities as a volunteer with Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.
