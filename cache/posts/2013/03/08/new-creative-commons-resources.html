<p>With <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/">Mix &amp; Mash</a> just around the corner, and with our interns looking to show off their skills and knowledge, we decided to rustle up a few new Creative Commons resources. We already had our <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/education/" target="_blank">education case studies</a>, our<a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank"> brochure</a>, our <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank">A3 po</a><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank">st</a><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/" target="_blank">er</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/10/the-original-creative-commoners-teachers-and-open-educational-resources/" target="_blank">this post</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/understand-and-teach-creative-commons/" target="_blank">this other post</a>, as well as <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/09/creative-commons-for-new-zealand-schools/" target="_blank">this piece</a>, originally printed in the Education Gazette.</p>
<p>But we knew we needed more. So, we first released <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/copyright-creative-commons-mix-mash-lesson-plan/" target="_blank">our Mix &amp; Mash lesson plan</a>, which quickly became a popular resource for teachers looking to introduce Creative Commons licensing in the classroom.</p>
<p>We then released a slide show, introducing <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MattMcGregor/creative-commons-for-schools">Creative Commons licensing for New Zealand schools</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after that, we put up <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/A2-finals.2.pdf" target="_blank">our new Creative Commons poster</a>.</p>
<p>And today, you can share, remix and reuse <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Free-to-Mix.pdf">our new, 12 page Free to Mix guide</a>! We've released this in A5, making it easy for teachers and students to use: just set your printer to 'booklet' and 'double-sided' and you'll have your very own Free to Mix booklet.</body></html></p>
