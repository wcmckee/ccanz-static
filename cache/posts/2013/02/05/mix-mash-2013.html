<p>As of 10am this morning, <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_blank">Mix &amp; Mash 2013: The New Storytelling</a> is officially open!</p>
<p>Mix &amp; Mash wants all New Zealanders, young and old, to tell new stories by adapting and remixing Public Domain and Creative Commons licensed content.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Mixes &amp; Mashes, The New Storytelling will roll out in three phases over the course of the year, with the first round of entries closing on <strong>May 10, 2013</strong>.</p>
<p>This time, we're working with just two categories--schools and the general public--with prizes available for all the stories <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/may-showcase-judges" target="_blank">our judges select</a>.</p>
<p>All entries selected for showcasing will receive a $50 itunes voucher, courtesy of <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a>. Selected entries for May will receive larger prizes, provided by Mix &amp; Mash sponsors <a href="http://www.orcon.net.nz/" target="_blank">Orcon</a> and <a href="http://www.copyright.co.nz/">Copyright Licensing New Zealand</a> and our Mix &amp; Mash partner, the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>All entries will also be considered for our end-of-year Supreme Awards, provided by <a href="http://www.squiz.co.nz/" target="_blank">Squiz</a> and <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a>.</p>
<p>School group submissions that help teach New Zealanders about road safety will be considered a special <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/schools" target="_blank">NZTA Award for Best Safer Journey’s Story</a>, receiving up to $500 in vouchers for each team member and $2000 in vouchers for the school.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/schools" target="_blank">Mix &amp; Mash portal</a> has some great remix resources, including our new Creative Commons poster.</p>
