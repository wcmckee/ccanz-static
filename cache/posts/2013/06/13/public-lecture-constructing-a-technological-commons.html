<p><html><body><p>In this public lecture, <a href="http://www.law.ucdavis.edu/faculty/lee/" target="_blank">Professor Peter Lee</a> from UC Davis will discuss ways to enhance access to inventions produced or funded by public institutions, producing what he calls a "technological commons." Hosted by Victoria University of Wellington's Faculty of Law and the Royal Society of New Zealand, the lecture will "challenge the traditional, market-based nature of the patent system."</p>
<p>A graduate of Yale Law, Professor Lee has <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=611323" target="_blank">published extensively on patent law and intellectual property</a>, and is a leading voice on the intersection of science and society and the patent system’s impact on scientific and technological progress.</p>
<p>The lecture will be chaired by <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/about/staff/graeme-austin" target="_blank">Professor Graeme Austin</a>, Victoria University Faculty of Law and member of the CCANZ legal team. It will be introduced by <a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/programmes/funds/marsden/about/staff/" target="_blank">Dean Peterson</a>, Manager of Research Funding at the Royal Society of New Zealand.</p>
