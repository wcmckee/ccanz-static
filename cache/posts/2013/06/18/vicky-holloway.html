<p><html><body><p>Vicky Holloway is a web designer, animator and illustrator based in Wellington, New Zealand. Some of Vicky’s work is made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives licence</a>.</p>
<p>Vicky first became aware of Creative Commons in 2005, though it wasn’t until she joined a collaborative art project in 2009 that she seriously considered using Creative Commons licensing. As she says, “We were looking for ways to license our work so that we could share it with other people, and maybe take it further as a group project.”</p>
<p>While following the <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_blank">Mix &amp; Mash</a> competitions in 2010 and 2011, Vicky started using Creative Commons licences for <a href="http://www.behance.net/squibbleworld" target="_blank">her Behance portfolio</a>.</p>
<p>As she explains, Creative Commons licensing on Behance is “built into the process. You must choose a license before publishing your work and they make it easy to choose which CC license is the best for you.”</p>

<p>The benefit of using Creative Commons licences, Vicky says, is that “it explicitly states ‘this is how I want my work to be used.’ And it also gives a link to further information. The licences make it very straightforward and easy to understand. It makes it easy to tell people what kinds of use you are happy with—and also what kinds of use you’re not happy with.</p>
<p>“I love how the internet encourages curiosity and creativity. However, the rights of the artist should still be protected. A CC license allows me to state exactly what I want to happen to my work and comes with a clear label.</p>
<p>"A CC license also gives me the option to share while protecting my copyright. I make a conscious decision on copyright each time I label a graphic, painting or animation.”</p>
<p>The Creative Commons licences, Vicky says, “protect me as well as the creator. Without a licence, it’s unclear what kinds of sharing and reuse the creator would be comfortable with. It can also be hard to find the owner of the artwork, if you want to legally reuse it.”</p>
<p>Vicky is currently licensing her work using a ‘No Derivatives’ licence. “I might be interested in remix for some of my work. At the moment, though, the ‘No Derivatives’ licence gives me the option to retain control over the work. I think Share-Alike is fantastic if you want to go down the path of promoting yourself. It gives you a wider audience by making it easier for people to share and reuse your work.”</p>
<p>Vicky looks forward to releasing more work under Creative Commons licensing in the future. She is currently working on a website where users can download free graphics and wallpapers. She is planning to release themes for a small fee, also using Creative Commons licensing. She is considering Creative Commons licensing for her other projects, including a compilation of a web-comic and a series of Vlogs.</p>
