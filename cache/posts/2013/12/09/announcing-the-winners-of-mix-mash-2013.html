<p><html><body><p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is proud to announce the winners of the <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/">Mix &amp; Mash 2013</a>, New Zealand’s great remix competition.</p>
<p>The open award has been won by Graham Jenson for ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/may-showcase/supreme-award-may-showcase-highly-commended">Mihimihi</a>’, an interactive timeline that traces Jenson’s family history back to the dawn of humanity.</p>
<p>The open award was judged by Lawrence Lessig, Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School and founding Board Member of Creative Commons.</p>
<p>“There is something impossibly difficult about the telescoping nature of the story,” said Lessig. “The combination of the two perspectives — the timeline and then video — create a powerful impression.”</p>

<p>The student award was taken out by ‘<a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/showcase/supreme-award-november-showcase-student-award">Tane's Tale</a>’ by Georgia, Nicole and Rachel Chappell from Christchurch, an ambitious, detailed and compelling story about the New Zealand environment.</p>
<p>Judge Chris Harwood from the Ministry of Education said that the “The original poem told a story that has happened many times in many contexts, and explored how cultural and economic perspectives must coexist for a sustainable future.”</p>
<p>Harwood also praised the story’s “quirky humour with NZ icons appearing unexpected on the screen—red band gumboots and pineapple lumps! I found myself looking for the next one!”</p>
