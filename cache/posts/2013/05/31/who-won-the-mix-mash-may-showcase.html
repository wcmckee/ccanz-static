<p><html><body><p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is proud to announce <a href="http://mixandmash.org.nz/showcase" target="_blank">the winners of the first showcase of Mix &amp; Mash 2013</a>, New Zealand’s great remix competition!</p>
<p>The open award has been won by Sadaf Lourie, Riccardo Scott, Jarred Bishop and Alex Gibson for ‘What Happened?’, an interactive children’s story. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mix_brown_rgb.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3364" title="mix_brown_rgb" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mix_brown_rgb.jpg" alt="" width="305" height="169"></a></p>
<p>Our judges commended ‘What Happened?’ for its "outstanding illustrations” and described it as "a lovely concept that works on, quite literally, several levels, with a sweet, slightly goose-bumpy ending."</p>
<p>The student award has been taken out by Travis, Evan and Jared Manning (aged 11, 9 and 6). Using stop motion animation, poetry, story writing and drawing, their video tells ‘The Story of Rangitoto.’</p>
<p>Our judges praised the story as “a dramatic and exciting retelling of the origins of a familiar piece of the Auckland landscape."</p>
