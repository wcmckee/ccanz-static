<p><html><body><p dir="ltr">As many of you may know, <a href="http://library.lincoln.ac.nz/About/Library-Staff/Staff-Profile/?StaffID=Penny.Carnaby" target="_blank">Penny Carnaby</a> has Chaired the <a title="Who We Are" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/about/who-we-are/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand Advisory Panel</a> since its inception in August 2010. After nearly three years at the helm of the CCANZ Panel, Penny recently decided to step down as Chair.</p></p>
<p dir="ltr"> Penny has been—and continues to be—a tireless champion of open access and open licensing in Aotearoa New Zealand. As Chief Executive at the National Library of New Zealand, Penny supported Brian Opie, Winston Roberts,  Paul Reynolds and all the others working to launch the Creative Commons project in Aotearoa NZ.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When CCANZ was adopted by the <a href="http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/" target="_blank">Royal Society of New Zealand</a>, Penny volunteered to Chair its Advisory Panel, and has done a remarkable job guiding the project ever since.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At her current role as University Librarian and Professor of Digital Knowledge Systems at Lincoln University, Penny continues to work for open access and open licensing for publicly funded research.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On behalf of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, I’d like to thank Penny for all her hard work!</p>

<p>Jane Hornibrook, who worked closely with Penny as CCANZ Public Lead from 2010-2012, also wanted to thank Penny for “sharing so much time and support for birth and development of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand. We’ve been lucky to have such a passionate and enthusiastic leader on our team.”</body></html></p>
