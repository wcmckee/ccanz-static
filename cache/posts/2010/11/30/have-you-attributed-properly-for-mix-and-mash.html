<p><html><body><p>Tonight's the night to get your remix or mashup entries in to <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_self">Mix and Mash: the great NZ remix and mashup competition</a>. If you've reused some appropriately licensed Creative Commons material in your entry it's worth taking some time at this point to make sure you credit your sources properly.</p>
<p>Each of the six main Creative Commons copyright licences have an <a href="http://creativecommons.org/characteristic/by" target="_self">Attribution</a> requirement built into them - meaning that you must attribute or 'credit' that work in the way the copyright holder wishes each time you reuse their work.</p>
<p>If the CC licensor has given you specific instructions on how to attribute them, then be sure to follow these instructions when you cite them in your <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/enter.html" target="_self">entry form</a>.</p>
<p>Many CC licensors don't give you specific instructions on how to attribute them though. On your entry form, follow these rules for <strong>EACH</strong> piece of CC content you've used (based on the Creative Commons <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FFAQ#How_do_I_properly_attribute_a_Creative_Commons_licensed_work.3F" target="_self">FAQ</a>):</p>
<p></p><ul></p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Cite the author&#39;s name, screen name, user identification, etc. You could even link to the person&#39;s profile page, if such a page exists.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Cite the work&#39;s title or name, if such a thing exists. The judges will want to see a direct link to the original work if such a link exists.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Cite the specific CC licence the work is under. It&#39;s preferable that you provide a link to the licence.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Your entry is obviously going to be a &#39;derivative work&#39; (remix) of the original works you are citing. You may want to describe which parts of the original content you&#39;ve changed and how.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
