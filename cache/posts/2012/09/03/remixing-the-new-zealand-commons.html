<p>In 2008, Matthew Poole posted a short piece on a talk by Lawrence Lessig on Russell Brown's <a href="http://publicaddress.net/" target="_blank">Public Address</a> website, and thus spawned what would come to be known as <a href="http://publicaddress.net/speaker/copyright-must-change/"> The Great Copyright Thread of Doom</a>. Spanning "<a href="http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/nethui-its-all-about-you/" target="_blank">89 pages</a>, 2202 comments and [a] dozen or so separate flame wars," the thread captured the <em>sturm und drang</em> typical of many online copyright debates.</p>
<p>While the thread, in all its novelistic glory, covered a range of issues, one of the more tempestuous topics was that of compensation: To wit, if New Zealand artists use open licences, how are they supposed to make a living?</p>
<p>By way of response, many Creative Commons supporters tend to riff on that famous aphorism of <a href="http://openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2002/12/11/piracy.html" target="_blank">Tim O'Reilly</a>, arguing that obscurity is a far greater threat to New Zealand artists than misuse or piracy. Others outline new 'business models' for artists, made possible by dwindling costs of production and distribution.</p>
<p>While it can be fun and enlightening to dive into the murk of online copyright debate, it's worth pointing out that the idea of New Zealand artists using Creative Commons licences to share their work is not some futuristic, speculative fantasy. In fact, a bunch of New Zealand artists having been doing so for a while now.</p>
