<p>Teachers, technologists and institutions around the world are celebrating open educational resources (OERs) for <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_self">Open Education Week</a>.</p>
<p>OERs are learning materials that can be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources" target="_self">freely shared and reused by anyone</a>. Creative Commons licences, when applied to teaching materials, help creators release their work for the public to enjoy and benefit from. Those same creators can also pick up someone else's Creative Commons licensed work to make their own outputs richer, more colorful or better informed.</p>
<p>The ability to bring in and and adapt high quality materials for new learning resources is vital in our digital information age. Finding pictures and videos to post on teaching blogs, reproducing chapters and articles, the ability to translate information into any language - each of these freedoms people want to enjoy legally are enabled by the OER movement.</p>
<p><strong>Open Access Week runs from March 5th - 10th</strong> and is designed to inform people about OERs and promote their value to a global learning environment. There will be webinars open to participation from anyone, virtual tours, pre-recorded presentations, documents and discussion opportunities.</p>
<p>Keep an eye of the <a href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_self">Open Education Week website</a> for information about upcoming events.</p>
