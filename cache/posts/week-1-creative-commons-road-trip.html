<p>We have officially completed the first five events of the Creative Commons Road Trip! When we planned the events back in December last year, we were expecting a quiet start to the month, with some <a title="CC Road Trip schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/" target="_blank">schools events</a> in Auckland and Wellington, gradually branching out to Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin in the second week. In the third and fourth week, we were planning to basically repeat that pattern, shifting focus to the <a title="CC Road Trip GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank">heritage sector</a>.</p>
<p>As we promoted the month, though, we started to get requests from other parts of the country,  quickly turning a tour of the main centres into a truly national road trip. Now that the organisational dust has settled, we’ve decided to also visit Tauranga, Napier, Havelock North, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Nelson and Greymouth. We’re also making plans to visit Hutt City, Whangarei and Invercargill.</p>

<p>So, we had a busy first week! In addition to the Creative Commons schools events in Wellington and Auckland, we held events in Greymouth, Nelson and Havelock North. Attendance varied: we had a small turnout for an after-school event in Auckland, though the staffroom at Havelock North High School at 8am was full.</p>
<p>Highlights from week one:</p>
<ul>

    <li>The Network for Learning officially joined the Creative Commons Road Trip, with Tim Kong, Pete Hall and Carolyn Stuart attending the school events.</li>

    <li>We had some <a title="Bay of Plenty Times" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&amp;objectid=11412205" target="_blank">handy coverage</a> in the <i>Bay of Plenty Times</i>, advertising our events in Tauranga on 16 March.</li>

    <li>Melissa Laing, one of the new CC regional facilitators, gave her first (of many, we hope!) introductions to CC licensing, alongside Pete Hall from N4L and Esther Casey from Cognition Education.</li>

    <li>As one of our speakers was ill, Matt skyped into an event at Nelson Provincial Museum -- from a half-full internet cafe in Napier. Both the Nelson museum community and the Napier internet-cafe community now have a working knowledge of CC licensing in the heritage sector.</li>

    <li>We’re receiving a heap of requests to send out resources. Keep them coming!</li>

    <li>We’ve launched our <a title="CC resources" href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">new resources page</a>, full to the brim with brochures, videos, posters and case studies on CC licensing in tertiary education, research, heritage and schools.</li>

</ul>

<p>In week two -- starting today! -- we’re going to be running schools events in Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton and Dunedin, as well as a heritage event in Whanganui. Week two happens to overlap with international <a title="Open Education Week" href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_blank">Open Education Week</a>, so we’re excited to join our friends and colleagues around the world in spreading the news on the benefits of open educational resources. There are still places available at all our upcoming events, so <a title="CC Road Trip" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/12/announcing-our-march-events/" target="_blank">register today</a>!</p>
