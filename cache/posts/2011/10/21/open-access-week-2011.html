<p>Open Access - the free, immediate, online access to the results of scholarly research, and the right to use and re-use those results as you need.</p>
<p>Open Access Week is global celebration of Open Access to scholarship and research. Institutions use this week as a designated opportunity to learn about and promote the benefits of Open Access, and help make it the new norm of practice.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons infrastructure underpins many open access initiatives by providing copyright licences which researchers and scholars can use to allow re-use of their work.</p>

<p><strong>Open Access for Climate Scientists 2011</strong></p>
<p>26 October 2011, DTU-Aqua, Copenhagen</p>
<p>Global Climate Change (GCC) research and related disciplines, focused on consequences and mitigation, are targeting humanity's "biggest challenge for the 21st century". The majority of that research is publicly funded, but currently it is not freely accessible to society and relevant stakeholders. Open Access provides the legal framework and e-infrastructures nested within universities to provide 100% free and immediate access to all future GCC-related, peer-reviewed research. The training is designed for all authors of peer-reviewed research, and will demonstrate the available means to achieve 100% open access, while boosting their own impact and citations.
