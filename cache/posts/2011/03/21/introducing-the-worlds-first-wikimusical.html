<p>The world's first wikimusical project <em>Xerxes’ Atlas</em> based in Auckland will use Creative Commons licences to achieve a highly collaborative musical feat. The production team have now announced they’re ready for contributors from theatre lovers around the globe.</p>
<p>The story is based on biblical/Jewish tale and follows Esther in the ancient Persia. After finding herself caught up in a beauty pageant where the winner becomes Queen of King Xerxes' massive empire, she wins the heart of the king only to discover a plot to declare a law of genocide against her own people.</p>
<p>The age-old story is set to be revived in a truly twenty first century breed of theatre production. "Xerxes' Atlas is about community and collaboration on a scale not seen in modern times in theatre,” said 28-year old creator and production board member Jade Wood.</p>
<p>Once composers have signed up online, they are able to start contributing to storyboard and song briefs by adding to other people's work-in-progress or craft their own <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike</a> licensed versions based on the briefs. Similar processes follow for the choreography and visual design elements whereby the internet community is invited to submit ideas and work with each other. A process of selection and polishing then takes place under the supervision of the show's Board of Directors. The script is co-developed by two writers and once the product is complete, people are able to remix and change it for themselves.</p>
<p>The premiere will be live-streamed from Auckland and made available online under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommecial-Share Alike 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>. The wikimuscial format means that a production could sound vastly different on Broadway than it is in the West End or even the West End a month after you saw it, since derivative versions are encouraged.</p>
<p>Chairwomen of the <em>Xerxes’ Atlas</em> Board, Bridget Marsh, said “declining theatre numbers, especially among younger generations, is a very real threat to the industry. We’re reaching out to a younger audience by developing a musical that connects with them through the internet and social media.”</p>
<p>“People can visit the website right now to read the song briefs and hear others’ contributions,” says Wood, “bringing a whole new audience around the world.”</p>
