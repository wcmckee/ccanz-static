<p>The folks at Squiz have built <a href="http://www.squiz.co.nz/mix-and-mash-2011" target="_self">a sweet suite of tools</a> to help people participate in Mix and Mash. You can submit ideas for mash-ups if you don't think you are able to build them yourself. You can browse ideas if you want to build something but need inspiration. There's even a matchmaking service available, to help build teams with a variety of skills. Ooh-la-la!</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, we'd like to say a huge thanks to all of our awesome Mix and Mash sponsors!</p>
