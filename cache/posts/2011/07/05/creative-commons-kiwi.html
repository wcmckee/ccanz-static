<p>[vimeo 25684782 w=500 h=325]</p>
<p>You can also view and <strong>download </strong>Creative Commons Kiwi from <a href="http://vimeo.com/25684782" target="_self">Vimeo</a> for sharing and remixing. A huge thanks to <a href="http://internetnz.net.nz/" target="_self">InternetNZ</a> who have supported us to create this resource.</p>
<p>We worked with <a href="http://mohawkmedia.co.nz/" target="_self">Mohawk Media</a> to create a New Zealand remix on the RSAnimate style of visual story-telling. Aside from the licences, the real star of this project is CCKiwi.</p>
<p>We've released him into the wild under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">CC BY licence</a>. Now it's up to you to remix him in ways that help explain Creative Commons to your colleagues, students and online friends.</p>
