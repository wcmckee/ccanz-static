<p><strong>15 - 16 August, InterContinental, Wellington</strong></p>
<p><em>This event is designed to cover significant new developments in IP law and to showcase how to commercialise your IP rights successfully. With presentations from the new Ministry of Science + Innovation, the Department of Internal Affairs and multiple case studies of successful companies, we take a close look at the state of IP in New Zealand ... The conference will also examine the effect digital technology and the internet are having on the way information is delivered and received and how they are opening up new ways of using and allowing others to use content. Update your knowledge of what you can and canâ€™t copy to ensure compliance.</em></p>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand will be offering a perspective on sharing content as part of business strategy online. There is also a session on the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework which recommends CC BY as the default licence for releasing government works for reuse by others.</p>
