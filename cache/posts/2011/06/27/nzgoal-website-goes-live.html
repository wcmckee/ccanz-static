<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is the proud custodian of a <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">new beta website</a> guide for those using the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework (NZGOAL). We're pleased to have been able to collaborate with Department of Internal Affairs officials and a member of the CCANZ Legal Panel to bring you this resource on all things NZGOAL.</p>
<p><a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programme/opening-government-data-and-information/nzgoal/read-nzgoal" target="_self">The framework</a> was approved by cabinet last winter, and has enjoyed much interest from government staff since. It recommends the Creative Commons BY licence as a default licence when releasing government held content and data for reuse.</p>
<p>You can view some <a href="http://opendatastories.org/" target="_self">great NZ success stories</a> where agencies have released material for reuse under the guidance of NZGOAL, resulting in some exciting and innovative mashups of the by the community.</p>
<p>This beta release of the site will be especially useful to those agencies looking to release some material in time for <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_self">Mix and Mash: the great NZ remix and mashup competition</a>, 2011. Last year's competition revealed some great incentives for government to make material available for mashup and reuse. Two examples are winning application entries <a href="http://nzwalksinfo.co.nz/" target="_self">NZ Walks</a> and <a href="http://www.mashblock.co.nz/%20" target="_self">Mashblock</a> which clearly add value to government information and make it useable, understandable, more interesting, relevant and accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Drop in to the new <a href="http://nzgoal.info/" target="_self">NZGOAL online</a> where you will find the online 'review and release process' tool, key documents, quick guides and answers to some common questions.</p>
<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>This NZGOAL site is being made available as a beta release and is administered by Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand in close consultation with Department of Internal Affairsâ€™ officials and a member of the CCANZ Legal Panel. It is not a government owned and operated site. We know it's not yet 100% WCAG2 compliant but we wanted to get something out there that agencies can start using, particularly given the imminence of the awesome Mix and Mash Competition for 2011!</body></html></p>
