<h2>Once again they are releasing some dynamic new music under Creative Commons licences and exploring ways of finding common ground by collaborating through art and performance.</h2>

<p><em>The PIYN project involves aspiring artists and performers from Auckland's diverse communities, working with the best of contemporary UK talent, to collaborate, create and celebrate. The programme involves capacity building workshops, online and face to face collaborations and master-classes in creativity. </em></p>
<p>This year the programme was kicked off in May by a visit from cultural icon Rosanna Raymond. Since then, the artistic community have been treated to workshops and presentations by Rosanna, UK artist Kevin Mark Trail, and Helen Baxter from Mohawk Media.<em> </em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://piyn.net/news/online-toolkit-links/" target="_self">Online Creative Toolkit</a> developed by Helen is a useful resource for creative practitioners utilising Internet platforms. It includes a rich arm of resources related to using Creative Commons for your content strategy. The toolkit is available for anyone to access and reuse under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz" target="_self">Creative Commons BY-NC-SA licence</a>.<em> </em></p>
<p>PIYN's impressive <a href="http://piyn.net/news/otherside-of-the-world/" target="_self">Otherside Of The World</a> initiative involves selected young NZ artists and young indie band artists from the Roundhouseâ€™s Take Part programme in Camden. It is a partnership between the British Council NZ, Redbull NZ, Play It Strange NZ, and the Roundhouse Camden London.</p>
<p>Turns are taken by these musicians to build upon each others work using online platforms such as SoundCloud and Skype meeting facilites from May 30th - 7th June.</p>
<p>This collaboration between London and Auckland which defies geographical distance and disparate time-zones and will result in an EP of Creative Commons licensed music. Parts of the EP will be loaded and promoted on <a href="http://www.ccmixter.org/people/britishcouncilnz" target="_self">ccMixter</a>, as well as through the Camden Roundhouse and the Red Bull Studio platform.</p>

Oliver Wayman from Bottletop and 'Akala' from the Hip-hop Shakespeare Company will run creative workshops in their expert fields, and a documentary about People In Your Neighbourhood 2010 will screen at the end of the month.</p>
