<p>These high quality aerial images of Christchurch following the devastating February 6.3 magnitude earthquake have <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake/4809621/High-quality-aerial-pictures-of-Christchurch-available" target="_self">been made available</a> on the <a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/3185-christchurch-post-earthquake-aerial-photos-24-feb-2011/" target="_self">Koordinates</a> platform under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>.</p>
<p>The images were produced by <a href="http://www.nzam.com/default.asp" target="_self">New Zealand Aerial Mapping (NZAM)</a> for <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/index.aspx" target="_self">Land Information New Zealand</a>. Their birds-eye-view perspective of the area helped Christchurch Police, Civil Defence, and other emergency services asses damage.</p>
<p>The Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_self">licence</a> attached to their public release allows anyone to legally copy, share, and adapt the imagery as long as they attribute the source.</p>
<p>The move to make public sector materials available under an open access option such as the Creative Commons Attribution licence is in line with the <a href="http://www.e.govt.nz/policy/nzgoal" target="_self">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing (NZGOAL) Framework</a>. This framework provides guidance for agencies when releasing copyright works and non-copyright material for re-use by third parties (the public), and was approved by Cabinet last July.</p>
<p>Those assisting the government to encourage Creative Commons licensing under the NZGOAL framework have noted its utility during the post-quake period where access to information and imagery is hugely important, and agencies are looking for guidance on releasing these materials.</p>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/" target="_self">Civil Defence</a> released some <a href="http://nbr.co.nz/article/video-central-christchurch-two-weeks-after-quake-ck-88665" target="_self">inner city footage</a> for screening at memorial events under a Creative Commons Attribution licence also.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/" target="_self">NZ Defence Force</a> are following suit by making their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nzdefenceforce/" target="_self">collections of recent photos</a>, many of Christchurch, Creative Commons Attribution via a Flickr stream.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nzdefenceforce/5469221429/in/set-72157625987305601/"><img class="size-full wp-image-475" title="chchcath" src="http://cc.royalsociety.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/chchcath.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331"></a></p>
<p>The non government project '<a href="http://eq.org.nz/" target="_self">Christchurch Recovery Map</a>' has also taken up the Creative Commons movement surrounding the February events. Its open and crowd-sourced map application of damage and relief reports throughout the city provided an API function and map images available under the Attribution licence.</body></html></p>
