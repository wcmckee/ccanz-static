<p></strong></h4></p>
<p>OPEN, ACCESS, promiscuity ...all bubble but no squeak</p>
<p>Has come out to wreck LU’s Open Access week</p>
<p>With definitions so pious and platitudes by the score</p>
<p>Cry out..</p>
<p>Free! Open! Saviours STOP! It makes our ears sore!</p>
<p>Open this Open that.. Is it Gold or just Green?</p>
<p>With MOOCS, mashups and link rot UG, it sounds quite obscene!</p>
<p>Defining OA can lead to copious frustrations</p>
<p>With Berlin, APCs and even Budapest declarations!</p>
<p>With this hype and confusion getting us in the poo</p>
<p>What on earth are our glorious researchers to do?</p>
<p>With this rapidly growing Open Access disputation</p>
<p>We must at all cost, AFFIRM academic reputation!!!</p>
<p><em>Researcher’s Lament was written for an OA week at Lincoln University, June 2014, as part of the LU Great Debate 2014 - for the negative side. The moot: Open Access enhances academic reputation.  Penny is the University Librarian and Professor Digital Knowledge Systems at Lincoln University. </em></p>
