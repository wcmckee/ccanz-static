<p><html><body><h4>BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE</h4></p>
<p>We’re going on a road trip -- please join us!</p>
<p>Recently, my <a title="CCANZ" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ</a> (CCANZ) colleague Matt McGregor <a title="On Recent Changes at CC Aotearoa" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/recent-changes-cc-aotearoa/" target="_blank">wrote an article</a> setting out our goals here at CCANZ, and the thinking behind them.</p>
<blockquote>In general, these <a title="CCANZ goals" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/roadmap-2014-2016/" target="_blank">goals</a> centre on CCANZ assisting a range of public-sector organisations with open policy adoption and implementation, with a particular focus on the heritage, research and schools sectors. Our workplan focuses on providing a heap of in-person workshops and resources, including targeted policy toolkits, brochures, posters and discussion pieces from the CC community. … While we still support licence adoption in the creative sector, and still support sensible copyright reform, open policy advocacy has become the clearest path for a small NGO like CCANZ to contribute to lasting social change.</blockquote>

<p>Now it’s time for us to hit the road and really help that change take off. Firstly, we’re developing a whole new set of resources to enable Kiwis to understand how copyright works in Aotearoa and how Creative Commons can help people solve copyright-related problems in the workplace. No law degree required! We have created special, sector-specific toolkits for use in NZ schools, universities, polytechs, museums, archives, libraries and other educational or heritage institutions. These are all freely available at <a title="CC resources" href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">resources.creativecommons.org.nz</a> and include policy templates, case studies, posters, educational videos, slides and articles.</p>
<ul>

    <li>Off-the-shelf policy templates that have been tried and tested in Kiwi institutions -- just change the names!</li>

    <li>Fully up to date and compliant with NZ law</li>

    <li>Created in consultation with people whose day job is copyright licensing, and designed to help solve real-life, specific problems</li>

    <li>Detailed case studies showing how Kiwis around the country are using Creative Commons to help solve copyright problems</li>

    <li>Simple and easy to use -- no copyright expertise required!</li>

    <li>Written by a combination of experts with detailed working knowledge of copyright law, Creative Commons licensing, and how these issues specifically pertain to the educational and heritage sectors in Aotearoa.</li>

</ul>

<p>Secondly, as well as making these resources freely downloadable to everyone who comes to our website, we are also taking them to schools and heritage institutions around the country -- in fact, we’re going on a road trip! We've made a <a title="CC Road Trip schools poster" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cc-by-school-a3.pdf" target="_blank">poster for schools</a> and a <a title="CC Road Trip GLAM poster" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cc-by-GLAM-a3.pdf" target="_blank">poster for GLAM</a> that we invite you to display and share.</p>
<p>We’ve gathered together a bunch of wonderful speakers from within the Creative Commons community who between them have decades of experience in negotiating the realities of copyright and licensing specifically in NZ schools and heritage institutions, including:</p>
