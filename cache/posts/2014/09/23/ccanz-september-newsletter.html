<h2>Introducing our new Communications Lead</h2>

This month <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/09/introducing-our-new-communications-lead/">Elizabeth Heritage</a> has joined Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand as our new Comms Lead. Elizabeth joins us from the publishing industry and will be working two days a week. Welcome!

<h2>We've Moved!</h2>

The <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/07/were-moving-to-the-oer-foundation/">new affiliate host</a> of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is the <a href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home">Open Education Resource Foundation</a>. Many thanks to our previous affiliate host, the Royal Society of New Zealand, for all their support over the past four years. We've also moved into our new offices with <a href="http://www.enspiral.com/">the team at Enspiral.</a>

<h2>Announcing NZCommons</h2>

In June, we launched <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/">NZCommons.org.nz</a>, a community site on copyright and the commons. Every week, we'll be publishing a few pieces from teachers, librarians, students, lawyers and more. If you're keen to write for us, we'd love to have you! Check out <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/contribute/">our contribute page</a> for more information.

<h2>Workshops</h2>

We're excited to offer free introductory workshops on copyright and Creative Commons licensing. We’re a small organisation, so we can’t promise to visit your organisation on the exact date you need us to, but we’ll certainly do our best. If we can’t make it in person, we’re happy to attend virtually, or find a local volunteer from the Creative Commons community. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/workshops/">Use this online form</a> to express your interest in hosting a workshop.

<h2>WW1 photographs made available for free reuse</h2>

The Alexander Turnbull Library has released hundreds of photographs of New Zealanders at the front for free download and reuse. You can find them on the excellent <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/">WW100 site</a>and <a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/photographing-new-zealanders-at-war">read more here</a>.

<h2>Te Papa releases tens of thousands of images online</h2>

The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa has <a href="http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2014/06/03/free-downloadable-images-from-te-papas-collections/">updated its Collections Online service</a>, releasing nearly forty thousand images as freely downloadable in high-res. <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/">Check out NZCommons</a> in the weeks ahead for a detailed case study.

<h2>Creative Commons Around the World</h2>

Creative Commons has published its annual report, <a href="http://teamopen.cc/thefuture/">The Future Is Open</a>, with loads of inspiring stories from around the world. And here are some international stories that have caught our eye: Yale University and the Library of Congress <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/seeing-the-great-depression/379238/">have released around 175,000 images</a> of Depression-era USA. The Danish Government has <a href="https://www.openaire.eu/newsletter-items/denmark-ambitious-oa-goals">announced its open access strategy</a>, aiming for 80% open access by 2017 and 100% by 2022. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia Commons</a> has recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, with more than 22 million images available that anyone can use freely. Happy birthday, Wikimedia! The Internet Archive <a href="http://blog.flickr.net/2014/08/29/welcome-the-internet-archive-to-the-commons/">has shared over 14 million high-res images</a> on Flickr Commons. <a href="http://openstax.org/">Open Stax</a> open textbooks have been downloaded more than 650,000 times, adopted for use in nearly 900 courses, saving students US $13 million.
