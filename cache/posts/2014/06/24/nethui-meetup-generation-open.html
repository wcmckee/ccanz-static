<p>Over the last four years, New Zealand’s culture and knowledge has become indisputably more open. Schools, universities, libraries, public agencies and artists from across the country are now releasing their work into the commons, for everyone to share and reuse.</p>
<p>The commons in New Zealand is growing. But what does this mean for the next generation of artists, writers, researchers and educators? What are their views on copyright, sharing and reuse? And what can we look forward to in the years ahead?</p>
<p>Join us for a wide-ranging, open conversation on the future of the commons in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss how kiwi culture and knowledge -- including textbooks, literature, music and research -- is being released for everyone, free of charge, and free of all legal and technical restrictions.</p>
<p>Featuring a panel discussion with special guests:</p>
