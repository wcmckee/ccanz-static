<p><html><body><p>In the middle of the year, we launched <a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/" target="_blank">NZCommons</a>, a community site for information and discussion on opening New Zealand’s culture and knowledge for sharing and reuse. As the site develops, we want it to be of use to as many communities as possible, including teachers, librarians, data users, government employees, researchers, students, artists and more.</p>
<p>To ensure that we’re meeting the needs of all these communities, we’re looking to appoint a volunteer editorial board. The editorial board will set the general direction of NZCommons and help ensure that the site is consistently publishing relevant, high quality interviews, case studies, resources, opinion pieces -- and whatever else the inaugural board thinks the site needs.</p>
<p>The board will also provide links to potential contributors, and generally help ensure that NZCommons is a lively, informative place. We're hoping that it will have representatives from all the different sectors we're looking to help.</p>
<p>The board will have the opportunity to meet remotely every two months, and will keep in touch with each other and Creative Commons staff via an email list and Loomio group. We'll use the meeting to discuss ideas for the site, the email lists to suggest potential topics and contributors and Loomio to make decisions.</p>
<p>The positions are voluntary, with a low time commitment -- though we would like the inaugural editorial board to commit to staying involved for at least twelve months.</p>
<p>If you're keen, please get in touch with Matt McGregor at matt@creativecommons.org.nz before 15 October.</p>
