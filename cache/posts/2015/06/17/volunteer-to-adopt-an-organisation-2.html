<p><html><body><p>We're looking for volunteers to help local organisations to adopt Creative Commons licensing.</p>
<p>At present, we're particularly keen to help local schools implement <a title="Creative Commons in Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools/">Creative Commons policies</a>, though if you have another local organisation that would like to help, feel free to get in touch. You don't have to be an expert -- we can teach you everything you'll need to know -- though some knowledge of copyright and Creative Commons licensing is preferred.</p>
<p>There are over 2,500 schools in New Zealand, and we're going to need your help to get to all of them!</p>
<p>If you're interested, fill out the form, below, and give us a quick sense of your background, region and which particular school(s) you would like to help out with. While you're at it, please check out <a title="Volunteer Guidelines" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/volunteer-guidelines/">our volunteer guidelines</a>, which outline your rights and responsibilities as a volunteer for CCANZ.</p>
<p>We'll get in touch and help you make contact with your chosen school. You willÂ  work with us to provide any assistance the school happens to need. This might involve a staff training session, a meeting with school leaders &amp; the BoT, distributing print resources or simply acting as a point of contact.</p>
