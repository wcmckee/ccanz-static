<p>This year we're publishing a book about the development of CC in NZ. It's called <i>A Quiet Revolution: Growing Creative Commons in Aotearoa</i>Â and we've been working with students of the Whitireia publishing programme on the editing and design. The book sets out the growth of CC in Aotearoa, what's happening now, and what it means; including case studies from all over the country and essays from experts.</p>
<p>It will primarily be an ebook, but we'd love to be able to make a small print run as well. To that end, we've just launched a crowdfunding campaign on PledgeMe:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pledgeme.co.nz/projects/4119-creative-commons-aotearoa-print-book" target="_blank">https://www.pledgeme.co.nz/projects/4119-creative-commons-aotearoa-print-book</a></p>
<p>The print book won't be available for sale in bookshops or anywhere else, so if you'd like a copy, pledging $25 or more to the campaign is the only way to get one.</p>

<p>Even if you're not able to spare any cash, we'd love it if you'd help spread the word - please tell anyone you think might be interested!</p>
<p>Special thanks to everyone who has contributed to the book so far, either by writing for us or by doing something amazing that's in there as a case study. Ka pai!</p>
