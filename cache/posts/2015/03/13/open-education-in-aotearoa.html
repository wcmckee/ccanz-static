<p><html><body><p>Educational resources are becoming increasingly unaffordable: since 1978, textbook prices have risen 812%. According to research from the US Public Interest Research Groups, 65% of students choose not to buy a college textbook because it’s too expensive and 94% report that they suffer academically because of this choice.</p>
<p>As a result, more and more educators -- and higher education institutions -- have committed to develop and reuse <a title="Open Education" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/education/">Open Educational Resources</a> (OERs). OERs are resources that made openly available, free of technical, legal and price restrictions on reuse.</p>
<p>Come along to hear about the future of Open Educational Resources in Aotearoa, featuring:</p>
