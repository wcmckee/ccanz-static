<p><html><body><p>We’re looking for contributors from a range of backgrounds to contribute to NZCommons, particularly in the areas of education, research, data, heritage, arts and copyright. If you're interested, get in touch: <a href="mailto:matt@creativecommons.org.nz">matt@creativecommons.org.nz</a></p>
<p>NZCommons is a site dedicated to discussing the opportunities and challenges of opening New Zealand’s culture and knowledge for access and reuse, with a particular focus on copyright, licensing and the public domain.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, more and more individuals and organisations have opened their work for sharing and reuse. At the same time, there is relatively little public discussion about New Zealanders everyday experiences of copyright and open licensing.</p>
<p>This is where NZCommons comes in. We want to encourage more informed discussion about copyright and licensing, while also growing and cross-pollinating the various open movements in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure if your work meets the scope of NZCommons, get in touch: <a href="mailto:matt@creativecommons.org.nz">matt@creativecommons.org.nz</a></p>
<p>NZCommons is managed and edited by the staff of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand -- but this doesn't mean that every piece has to be related to Creative Commons. Ultimately the nature of the site will depend on the people who volunteer to write for it. This is where you come in.</p>
<p><b><i>OK, I’m interested in writing for NZCommons. Now what?</i></b></p>
<p>Contact us with a topic and a suggested deadline. We'll give you a gentle reminder closer to the date.</p>
<p><em><strong>Will I have to publish my post under a CC licence?</strong></em></p>
<p>Yes. All writers for NZCommons keep their copyright, but it's the policy of Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ to publish under an open licence. Our default licence is CC-BY. If you want to use a different CC licence, let us know.</p>
<p><em><strong>I have an amazing CC licensed image. Can I show it off on NZCommons?</strong></em></p>
<p>Probably. Every week or so, we're going to feature some open images from NZ artists and the collections of our heritage institutions. We can't make any guarantees, but we'd love to see your work.</p>
<p><em><strong>I'm releasing work under CC, but I don't want to write about myself. Can you interview me? </strong></em></p>
<p>Definitely. We love to feature individuals and institutions releasing copyright works under CC licensing. Get in touch.</p>
<p><b><i>What will the publishing process look like?</i></b></p>
