<p><html><body><h3>Introduction</h3></p>
<p>Creative Commons licences make it easy for you to share your copyright works. The six Creative Commons licences ensure that others can copy and distribute your work, provided they give you credit — and only on the conditions you specify.</p>
<p>Produced by the expert Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand legal team, the New Zealand Creative Commons licences are legally robust, free of charge and easy to understand. For other resources explaining the licences, including brochures and videos, <a title="Resources" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/resources/">visit our Resources page</a>.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of millions of items made available under a Creative Commons licence. Licence users include the White House and the New Zealand Government. For examples of other New Zealand licence users, you can read our <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/category/case-studies/" target="_blank">case studies of licence users</a>. You can read case studies specific to your area of interest via <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz" target="_blank">our projects pages</a>.</p>
<h3>Layers</h3>

<p>Each Creative Commons licence is expressed in three ‘layers’:</p>
<ul>

    <li>Commons Deed. This is a ‘human-readable’ plain-language summary of the licence, with relevant icons. This means that others will be able to easily understand the range of permissions you are allowing.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

    <li>Legal Code: This is the ‘lawyer-readable’ licence, with full legal terms.</li>

</ul>

<ul>

    <li>Digital Code: This is a machine-readable translation of the licence that helps search engines and other applications identify the licensed work, ensuring that others will be able to find your work.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Versions and Ports</h3>

<p>Every few years, Creative Commons has revised its licences to ensure that they are completely up-to-date.</p>
<p>Many countries around the world have also ‘ported’ the licences, to make sure that the licences are compatible with local copyright and other law.</p>
<p>We recommend that New Zealanders use either the 4.0 licences or the 3.0 New Zealand licences, which were produced by the Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand legal team. Both licence sets are internationally valid. You can read more about <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/versions-and-ports" target="_blank">versions and ports here</a>.</p>
<p>If you work at a government agency, please note that the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework adopts the 4.0 International Creative Commons licences.</p>
<h3>Licence Elements</h3>

<p>There are four Creative Commons licence elements.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/by.large_1.png"><img class="wp-image-5922 alignleft" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/by.large_1-300x300.png" alt="by.large" width="100" height="100"></a></p>
<p><strong>ATTRIBUTION</strong></p>
<p>This means that others must credit you as the original creator of the work. All Creative Commons licences require users to provide attribution. More information on <a title="Choose and apply a CC licence" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/choose-and-apply-a-cc-licence/" target="_blank">how to provide attribution can be found here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nc.large_.png"><img class="wp-image-5916 alignleft" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nc.large_-300x300.png" alt="nc.large" width="100" height="100"></a><strong>NONCOMMERCIAL </strong></p>
<p>This means that others may not share, adapt or reuse use your work if their use is primarily intended for commercial advantage or monetary compensation. More information on <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/the-noncommercial-licences/" target="_blank">the definition of Non-Commercial can be found here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nd.large_.png"><img class="wp-image-5918 alignleft" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nd.large_-300x300.png" alt="nd.large" width="100" height="100"></a><strong>NODERIVATIVES</strong></p>
<p>This means that others can share your work, but they must not change it. Note that users still have the range of Fair Dealing rights granted to them under the Copyright Act 1994.</p>
<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/sa.large_.png"><img class="wp-image-5917 alignleft" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/sa.large_-300x300.png" alt="sa.large" width="100" height="100"></a><strong>SHAREALIKE</strong></p>
<p>This means that those who adapt or remix your work must use the same Creative Commons licence on any derivative works. Before remixing works that have different licences, check <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_combine_material_that_uses_different_Creative_Commons_licenses_into_my_work.3F" target="_blank">this licence compatibility chart</a>.</p>

<h3>The Licences</h3>

<p>These four licence elements combine to make six Creative Commons licences. They are free for anyone to use.
