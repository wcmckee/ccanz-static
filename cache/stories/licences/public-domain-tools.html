<p><html><body><p>The Creative Commons licences help authors and other copyright owners keep and manage their copyright on terms they choose. Creative Commons has also created public domain tools that enable authors and copyright owners who want to dedicate their works to the worldwide public domain to do so (CC0) and facilitate the labeling and discovery of works that are already free of known copyright restrictions (Public Domain Mark).</p>
<p><strong>CC0</strong></p>
<p>Use this universal tool if you are a holder of copyright or database rights, and you wish to waive all your interests in your work worldwide to the maximum extent permitted by law. If the waiver is ineffective under a country's copyright laws, the tool has a fall back position of granting a wide and restriction-free licence.</p>

<p><strong>Public Domain Mark</strong></p>
<p>Use this tool if you have identified a work that is free of known copyright restrictions. Creative Commons does not recommend this tool for works that are restricted by copyright laws in one or more jurisdictions.</p>
