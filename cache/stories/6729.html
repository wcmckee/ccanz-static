<p><html><body><h4>Overall Purpose</h4></p>
<p>To grow the commons in Aotearoa New Zealand, by ensuring more New Zealand state sector organisations use Creative Commons licensing to release their copyright resources.</p>
<h4>Responsibilities</h4>

<p>If you volunteer to adopt an organisation, you will be responsible for introducing and guiding that organisation through the adoption of Creative Commons licensing. Depending on the nature of the organisation, this may involve:</p>
<ul>

    <li>learning about copyright and licensing issues relevant to that sector;</li>

    <li>building and maintaining relationships with key staff in each organisation;</li>

    <li>providing professional development, including a talk or workshops;</li>

    <li>putting staff in touch with CCANZ print and online resources;</li>

    <li>potentially assisting with meetings with staff or leadership teams; and,</li>

    <li>reporting to Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ staff on progress.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Time Committment</h4>

<p>There will be an initial time committment of several hours to learn about the relevant issues in your chosen sector. After that, the time committment will depend on how quickly your adopted organisation chooses to advance Creative Commons, and the level of support they need. For some organisations, it may only require email contact; others may require you to provide a workshop and/or attend meetings in-person. We would appreciate an initial committment from volunteers of six months.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong></p>
<p>You will be working alongside Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand staff, who will provide contacts, learning resources (print and online), policy documents, template powerpoints and contact with a community  of other volunteers.</p>
<p><strong>Payment</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are unable to provide payment for these positions.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>
<p>Volunteers to adopt an organisation should be confident in their ability to: a) learn about copyright and open licensing;  and b) share that knowledge with a diverse and busy audience. Volunteers with experience in or knowledge of their chosen sector are especially welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition</strong></p>
<p>We'll keep a register of active volunteers on our 'volunteers' page. Inactive volunteers will recognised in an 'alumni' section.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>

    <li>Volunteers will be tasked with introducing - and not 'selling' - Creative Commons licensing to their chosen organisation. It's important to respect the fact that not every organisation will necessarily be ready to implement CC licensing. We can help you determine how to approach an organisation in your chosen sector.</li>

    <li>Volunteers will be helping to realise the shared goals of the CC Aotearoa New Zealand community, and won't be representing or speaking on behalf of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.</li>

    <li>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is hosted by the Open Educational Resource Foundation, a registered charity in New Zealand, and does not engage in political lobbying.</li>

</ul>
