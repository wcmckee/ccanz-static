<p><html><body><p>In the first half of 2016, we want to help organise, with partners and volunteers from across New Zealand, Open Educational Resource Sprints. The OER Sprints will bring together teachers, librarians, academics, technologists, editors - and maybe even a few lawyers - for a day or weekend to collaboratively produce free, open educational resources.</p>
<p>These resources will then become available for <em>anyone</em> to access, adapt and reuse.</p>
<p>We want to grow a commons of open educational resources, so that every teacher in New Zealand has free and open access to all the resources they need, without having to ask permission or reinvent the wheel. If you want to know more about open educational resources in New Zealand schools, you can read <a title="Creative Commons in Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools/">more here</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be building on the success of similar projects, such as the <a title="Announcing the Creative Commons Media Studies Textbook" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/02/announcing-the-creative-commons-media-studies-textbook/">Media Text Hack</a>, in which a group of educators created a free and open Media Studies undergraduate textbook in a weekend (now an assigned textbook at the University of Otago).</p>

<p>It's still early days, so there's a lot we haven't figured out yet. We'll get in touch as soon as we finalise the structure of the events (including dates and venues). We're committed to holding events in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch at a minimum - though we'd love to help organise many more (though we'll need your help).</p>
<p>And if you want to help organise the events (or if you're just feeling nosy), <a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/23k8VZ9w/oer-sprints" target="_blank">you can join our Loomio group</a>. We'll be making all the decisions about the events there, in the open.</p>
