<p><html><body><p>Since the release of the 1.0 licences in 2002, the Creative Commons licences have been improved and clarified by an international team of lawyers. The current version, version 4.0, was published in November 2013.</p>
<p>Versions of the licences have also been ‘ported’ by many legal jurisdictions, to ensure that they are fully compatible with national contract and copyright law.</p>
<p>Most New Zealanders will face a choice between the Creative Commons 4.0 licences, which are intended to be international, and the 3.0 New Zealand licences, which were ported by the Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand legal team in 2007.</p>
<p>To get a Creative Commons 3.0 New Zealand licence from the Licence Chooser, please click 'Looking for ports of earlier versions' at the top of the screen. At the pop-up screen, click 'show earlier licence ports.' This will  enable you to choose 'New Zealand' from the 'Licence Jurisdiction' menu.</p>
<p>Which licence should you use? For most people, it is unlikely to matter. Some benefits to using a New Zealand licence would be:</p>
<p></p><ul></p>
<pre class="code literal-block"><span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>their plain English language, which is easier to understand than the American legal language of the generic licences;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>because they follow national contract and copyright law, they offer explicit protection of your ‘moral rights’;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>the support offered by the New Zealand project;<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>in the very unlikely event of any dispute over the terms of the licence, they provide that this should be heard in the courts of your own country.<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
