<p><html><body><p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand is excited to offer free introductory workshops on copyright and Creative Commons licensing. We're particularly keen to visit public sector organisations, including schools, research and heritage organisations, though we're also more than happy to talk to other groups and present at public events.</p>
<p>We're a small organisation, so we can't promise to visit your organisation on the exact date you need us to, but we'll certainly do our best. We have workshop facilitators in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin, and regularly travel to other parts of New Zealand. If we can't make it in person, we're happy to attend virtually, or find a local volunteer from the Creative Commons community.Â <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CCvid.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4882" src="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CCvid-300x253.jpg" alt="CCvid" width="171" height="144"></a></p>
<p>If you're interested, please fill out the form below. To help with our planning, please give us as many possible dates - or the widest range - as you can. Also, When we travel, we like to get as much done as possible, so if there are other local organisations who might be interested in hearing about Creative Commons, please send them a link to this page.</p>
<p>While these events are offered for free, we are a charitable organisation and do appreciate any contribution you can make. Occasionally, guest speakers receive small gifts, such as book tokens or petrol vouchers. If you are planning to give Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ a small gift for speaking, we would <em>much</em> prefer that you give a donation. We will use this donation to fund additional outreach activities.</p>
